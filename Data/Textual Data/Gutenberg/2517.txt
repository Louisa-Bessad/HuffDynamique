abraham
lincoln
the
great
story
telling
president
whose
emancipation
proclamation
freed
more
than
four
million
slaves
was
a
keen
politician
profound
statesman
shrewd
diplomatist
a
thorough
judge
of
men
and
possessed
of
an
intuitive
knowledge
of
affairs
he
was
the
first
chief
executive
to
die
at
the
hands
of
an
assassin
without
school
education
he
rose
to
power
by
sheer
merit
and
willpower
born
in
a
kentucky
log
cabin
in
his
surroundings
being
squalid
his
chances
for
advancement
were
apparently
hopeless
president
lincoln
died
april
th
having
been
shot
by
j
wilkes
booth
the
night
before
preface
dean
swift
said
that
the
man
who
makes
two
blades
of
grass
grow
where
one
grew
before
serves
well
of
his
kind
considering
how
much
grass
there
is
in
the
world
and
comparatively
how
little
fun
we
think
that
a
still
more
deserving
person
is
the
man
who
makes
many
laughs
grow
where
none
grew
before
sometimes
it
happens
that
the
biggest
crop
of
laugh
is
produced
by
a
man
who
ranks
among
the
greatest
and
wisest
such
a
man
was
abraham
lincoln
whose
wholesome
fun
mixed
with
true
philosophy
made
thousands
laugh
and
think
at
the
same
time
he
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
saying
laugh
and
the
world
laughs
with
you
whenever
abraham
lincoln
wanted
to
make
a
strong
point
he
usually
began
by
saying
now
that
reminds
me
of
a
story
and
when
he
had
told
a
story
every
one
saw
the
point
and
was
put
into
a
good
humor
the
ancients
had
aesop
and
his
fables
the
moderns
had
abraham
lincoln
and
his
stories
aesops
fables
have
been
printed
in
book
form
in
almost
every
language
and
millions
have
read
them
with
pleasure
and
profit
lincolns
stories
were
scattered
in
the
recollections
of
thousands
of
people
in
various
parts
of
the
country
the
historians
who
wrote
histories
of
lincolns
life
remembered
only
a
few
of
them
but
the
most
of
lincolns
stories
and
the
best
of
them
remained
unwritten
more
than
five
years
ago
the
author
of
this
book
conceived
the
idea
of
collecting
all
the
yarns
and
stories
the
droll
sayings
and
witty
and
humorous
anecdotes
of
abraham
lincoln
into
one
large
book
and
this
volume
is
the
result
of
that
idea
before
lincoln
was
ever
heard
of
as
a
lawyer
or
politician
he
was
famous
as
a
story
teller
as
a
politician
he
always
had
a
story
to
fit
the
other
side
as
a
lawyer
he
won
many
cases
by
telling
the
jury
a
story
which
showed
them
the
justice
of
his
side
better
than
any
argument
could
have
done
while
nearly
all
of
lincolns
stories
have
a
humorous
side
they
also
contain
a
moral
which
every
good
story
should
have
they
contain
lessons
that
could
be
taught
so
well
in
no
other
way
every
one
of
them
is
a
sermon
lincoln
like
the
man
of
galilee
spoke
to
the
people
in
parables
nothing
that
can
be
written
about
lincoln
can
show
his
character
in
such
a
true
light
as
the
yarns
and
stories
he
was
so
fond
of
telling
and
at
which
he
would
laugh
as
heartily
as
anyone
for
a
man
whose
life
was
so
full
of
great
responsibilities
lincoln
had
many
hours
of
laughter
when
the
humorous
funloving
side
of
his
great
nature
asserted
itself
every
person
to
keep
healthy
ought
to
have
one
good
hearty
laugh
every
day
lincoln
did
and
the
author
hopes
that
the
stories
at
which
he
laughed
will
continue
to
furnish
laughter
to
all
who
appreciate
good
humor
with
a
moral
point
and
spiced
with
that
true
philosophy
bred
in
those
who
live
close
to
nature
and
to
the
people
around
them
in
producing
this
new
lincoln
book
the
publishers
have
followed
an
entirely
new
and
novel
method
of
illustrating
it
the
old
shopworn
pictures
that
are
to
be
seen
in
every
history
of
lincoln
and
in
every
other
book
written
about
him
such
as
a
flatboat
on
the
sangamon
river
state
capitol
at
springfield
old
log
cabin
etc
have
all
been
left
out
and
in
place
of
them
the
best
special
artists
that
could
be
employed
have
supplied
original
drawings
illustrating
the
point
of
lincolns
stories
these
illustrations
are
not
copies
of
other
pictures
but
are
original
drawings
made
from
the
authors
original
text
expressly
for
this
book
in
these
highclass
outline
pictures
the
artists
have
caught
the
true
spirit
of
lincolns
humor
and
while
showing
the
laughable
side
of
many
incidents
in
his
career
they
are
true
to
life
in
the
scenes
and
characters
they
portray
in
addition
to
these
new
and
original
pictures
the
book
contains
many
rare
and
valuable
photograph
portraits
together
with
biographies
of
the
famous
men
of
lincolns
day
whose
lives
formed
a
part
of
his
own
life
history
no
lincoln
book
heretofore
published
has
ever
been
so
profusely
so
artistically
and
expensively
illustrated
the
parables
yarns
stories
anecdotes
and
sayings
of
the
immortal
abe
deserve
a
place
beside
aesops
fables
bunyans
pilgrims
progress
and
all
other
books
that
have
added
to
the
happiness
and
wisdom
of
mankind
lincolns
stories
are
like
lincoln
himself
the
more
we
know
of
them
the
better
we
like
them
by
colonel
alexander
k
mcclure
while
lincoln
would
have
been
great
among
the
greatest
of
the
land
as
a
statesman
and
politician
if
like
washington
jefferson
and
jackson
he
had
never
told
a
humorous
story
his
sense
of
humor
was
the
most
fascinating
feature
of
his
personal
qualities
he
was
the
most
exquisite
humorist
i
have
ever
known
in
my
life
his
humor
was
always
spontaneous
and
that
gave
it
a
zest
and
elegance
that
the
professional
humorist
never
attains
as
a
rule
the
men
who
have
become
conspicuous
in
the
country
as
humorists
have
excelled
in
nothing
else
s
s
cox
proctor
knott
john
p
hale
and
others
were
humorists
in
congress
when
they
arose
to
speak
if
they
failed
to
be
humorous
they
utterly
failed
and
they
rarely
strove
to
be
anything
but
humorous
such
men
often
fail
for
the
professional
humorist
however
gifted
cannot
always
be
at
his
best
and
when
not
at
his
best
he
is
grievously
disappointing
i
remember
corwin
of
ohio
who
was
a
great
statesman
as
well
as
a
great
humorist
but
whose
humor
predominated
in
his
public
speeches
in
senate
and
house
warning
a
number
of
the
younger
senators
and
representatives
on
a
social
occasion
when
he
had
returned
to
congress
in
his
old
age
against
seeking
to
acquire
the
reputation
of
humorists
he
said
it
was
the
mistake
of
his
life
he
loved
it
as
did
his
hearers
but
the
temptation
to
be
humorous
was
always
uppermost
and
while
his
speech
on
the
mexican
war
was
the
greatest
ever
delivered
in
the
senate
excepting
websters
reply
to
hayne
he
regretted
that
he
was
more
known
as
a
humorist
than
as
a
statesman
his
first
great
achievement
in
the
house
was
delivered
in
in
reply
to
general
crary
of
michigan
who
had
attacked
general
harrisons
military
career
corwins
reply
in
defense
of
harrison
is
universally
accepted
as
the
most
brilliant
combination
of
humor
and
invective
ever
delivered
in
that
body
the
venerable
john
quincy
adams
a
day
or
two
after
corwins
speech
referred
to
crary
as
the
late
general
crary
and
the
justice
of
the
remark
from
the
old
man
eloquent
was
accepted
by
all
mr
lincoln
differed
from
the
celebrated
humorists
of
the
country
in
the
important
fact
that
his
humor
was
unstudied
he
was
not
in
any
sense
a
professional
humorist
but
i
have
never
in
all
my
intercourse
with
public
men
known
one
who
was
so
apt
in
humorous
illustration
us
mr
lincoln
and
i
have
known
him
many
times
to
silence
controversy
by
a
humorous
story
with
pointed
application
to
the
issue
his
face
was
the
saddest
in
repose
that
i
have
ever
seen
among
accomplished
and
intellectual
men
and
his
sympathies
for
the
people
for
the
untold
thousands
who
were
suffering
bereavement
from
the
war
often
made
him
speak
with
his
heart
upon
his
sleeve
about
the
sorrows
which
shadowed
the
homes
of
the
land
and
for
which
his
heart
was
freely
bleeding
i
have
many
times
seen
him
discussing
in
the
most
serious
and
heartfelt
manner
the
sorrows
and
bereavements
of
the
country
and
when
it
would
seem
as
though
the
tension
was
so
strained
that
the
brittle
cord
of
life
must
break
his
face
would
suddenly
brighten
like
the
sun
escaping
from
behind
the
cloud
to
throw
its
effulgence
upon
the
earth
and
he
would
tell
an
appropriate
story
and
much
as
his
stories
were
enjoyed
by
his
hearers
none
enjoyed
them
more
than
mr
lincoln
himself
i
have
often
known
him
within
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
to
be
transformed
from
the
saddest
face
i
have
ever
looked
upon
to
one
of
the
brightest
and
most
mirthful
it
was
well
known
that
he
had
his
great
fountain
of
humor
as
a
safety
valve
as
an
escape
and
entire
relief
from
the
fearful
exactions
his
endless
duties
put
upon
him
in
the
gravest
consultations
of
the
cabinet
where
he
was
usually
a
listener
rather
than
a
speaker
he
would
often
end
dispute
by
telling
a
story
and
none
misunderstood
it
and
often
when
he
was
pressed
to
give
expression
on
particular
subjects
and
his
always
abundant
caution
was
baffled
he
many
times
ended
the
interview
by
a
story
that
needed
no
elaboration
i
recall
an
interview
with
mr
lincoln
at
the
white
house
in
the
spring
of
just
before
lee
retreated
from
petersburg
it
was
well
understood
that
the
military
power
of
the
confederacy
was
broken
and
that
the
question
of
reconstruction
would
soon
be
upon
us
colonel
forney
and
i
had
called
upon
the
president
simply
to
pay
our
respects
and
while
pleasantly
chatting
with
him
general
benjamin
f
butler
entered
forney
was
a
great
enthusiast
and
had
intense
hatred
of
the
southern
leaders
who
had
hindered
his
advancement
when
buchanan
was
elected
president
and
he
was
bubbling
over
with
resentment
against
them
he
introduced
the
subject
to
the
president
of
the
treatment
to
be
awarded
to
the
leaders
of
the
rebellion
when
its
powers
should
be
confessedly
broken
and
he
was
earnest
in
demanding
that
davis
and
other
conspicuous
leaders
of
the
confederacy
should
be
tried
condemned
and
executed
as
traitors
general
butler
joined
colonel
forney
in
demanding
that
treason
must
be
made
odious
by
the
execution
of
those
who
had
wantonly
plunged
the
country
into
civil
war
lincoln
heard
them
patiently
as
he
usually
heard
all
and
none
could
tell
however
carefully
they
scanned
his
countenance
what
impression
the
appeal
made
upon
him
i
said
to
general
butler
that
as
a
lawyer
preeminent
in
his
profession
he
must
know
that
the
leaders
of
a
government
that
had
beleaguered
our
capital
for
four
years
and
was
openly
recognized
as
a
belligerent
power
not
only
by
our
government
but
by
all
the
leading
governments
of
the
world
could
not
be
held
to
answer
to
the
law
for
the
crime
of
treason
butler
was
vehement
in
declaring
that
the
rebellious
leaders
must
be
tried
and
executed
lincoln
listened
to
the
discussion
for
half
an
hour
or
more
and
finally
ended
it
by
telling
the
story
of
a
common
drunkard
out
in
illinois
who
had
been
induced
by
his
friends
time
and
again
to
join
the
temperance
society
but
had
always
broken
away
he
was
finally
gathered
up
again
and
given
notice
that
if
he
violated
his
pledge
once
more
they
would
abandon
him
as
an
utterly
hopeless
vagrant
he
made
an
earnest
struggle
to
maintain
his
promise
and
finally
he
called
for
lemonade
and
said
to
the
man
who
was
preparing
it
couldnt
you
put
just
a
drop
of
the
cratur
in
unbeknownst
to
me
after
telling
the
story
lincoln
simply
added
if
these
men
could
get
away
from
the
country
unbeknownst
to
us
it
might
save
a
world
of
trouble
all
understood
precisely
what
lincoln
meant
although
he
had
given
expression
in
the
most
cautious
manner
possible
and
the
controversy
was
ended
lincoln
differed
from
professional
humorists
in
the
fact
that
he
never
knew
when
he
was
going
to
be
humorous
it
bubbled
up
on
the
most
unexpected
occasions
and
often
unsettled
the
most
carefully
studied
arguments
i
have
many
times
been
with
him
when
he
gave
no
sign
of
humor
and
those
who
saw
him
under
such
conditions
would
naturally
suppose
that
he
was
incapable
of
a
humorous
expression
at
other
times
he
would
effervesce
with
humor
and
always
of
the
most
exquisite
and
impressive
nature
his
humor
was
never
strained
his
stories
never
stale
and
even
if
old
the
application
he
made
of
them
gave
them
the
freshness
of
originality
i
recall
sitting
beside
him
in
the
white
house
one
day
when
a
message
was
brought
to
him
telling
of
the
capture
of
several
brigadiergenerals
and
a
number
of
horses
somewhere
out
in
virginia
he
read
the
dispatch
and
then
in
an
apparently
soliloquizing
mood
said
sorry
for
the
horses
i
can
make
brigadiergenerals
there
are
many
who
believe
that
mr
lincoln
loved
to
tell
obscene
or
profane
stories
but
they
do
great
injustice
to
one
of
the
purest
and
best
men
i
have
ever
known
his
humor
must
be
judged
by
the
environment
that
aided
in
its
creation
as
a
prominent
lawyer
who
traveled
the
circuit
in
illinois
he
was
much
in
the
company
of
his
fellow
lawyers
who
spent
their
evenings
in
the
rude
taverns
of
what
was
then
almost
frontier
life
the
western
people
thus
thrown
together
with
but
limited
sources
of
culture
and
enjoyment
logically
cultivated
the
story
teller
and
lincoln
proved
to
be
the
most
accomplished
in
that
line
of
all
the
members
of
the
illinois
bar
they
had
no
private
rooms
for
study
and
the
evenings
were
always
spent
in
the
common
barroom
of
the
tavern
where
western
wit
often
vulgar
or
profane
was
freely
indulged
in
and
the
best
of
them
at
times
told
stories
which
were
somewhat
broad
but
even
while
thus
indulging
in
humor
that
would
grate
harshly
upon
severely
refined
hearers
they
despised
the
vulgarian
none
despised
vulgarity
more
than
lincoln
i
have
heard
him
tell
at
one
time
or
another
almost
or
quite
all
of
the
stories
he
told
during
his
presidential
term
and
there
were
very
few
of
them
which
might
not
have
been
repeated
in
a
parlor
and
none
descended
to
obscene
vulgar
or
profane
expressions
i
have
never
known
a
man
of
purer
instincts
than
abraham
lincoln
and
his
appreciation
of
all
that
was
beautiful
and
good
was
of
the
highest
order
it
was
fortunate
for
mr
lincoln
that
he
frequently
sought
relief
from
the
fearfully
oppressive
duties
which
bore
so
heavily
upon
him
he
had
immediately
about
him
a
circle
of
men
with
whom
he
could
be
at
home
in
the
white
house
any
evening
as
he
was
with
his
old
time
friends
on
the
illinois
circuit
david
davis
was
one
upon
whom
he
most
relied
as
an
adviser
and
leonard
swett
was
probably
one
of
his
closest
friends
while
ward
lamon
whom
he
made
marshal
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
have
him
by
his
side
was
one
with
whom
he
felt
entirely
at
home
davis
was
of
a
more
sober
order
but
loved
lincolns
humor
although
utterly
incapable
of
a
humorous
expression
himself
swett
was
ready
with
lincoln
to
give
and
take
in
storyland
as
was
lamon
and
either
of
them
and
sometimes
all
of
them
often
dropped
in
upon
lincoln
and
gave
him
an
hours
diversion
from
his
exacting
cares
they
knew
that
he
needed
it
and
they
sought
him
for
the
purpose
of
diverting
him
from
what
they
feared
was
an
excessive
strain
his
devotion
to
lamon
was
beautiful
i
well
remember
at
harrisburg
on
the
night
of
february
when
at
a
dinner
given
by
governor
curtin
to
mr
lincoln
then
on
his
way
to
washington
we
decided
against
the
protest
of
lincoln
that
he
must
change
his
route
to
washington
and
make
the
memorable
midnight
journey
to
the
capital
it
was
thought
to
be
best
that
but
one
man
should
accompany
him
and
he
was
asked
to
choose
there
were
present
of
his
suite
colonel
sumner
afterwards
one
of
the
heroic
generals
of
the
war
norman
b
judd
who
was
chairman
of
the
republican
state
committee
of
illinois
colonel
lamon
and
others
and
he
promptly
chose
colonel
lamon
who
alone
accompanied
him
on
his
journey
from
harrisburg
to
philadelphia
and
thence
to
washington
before
leaving
the
room
governor
curtin
asked
colonel
lamon
whether
he
was
armed
and
he
answered
by
exhibiting
a
brace
of
fine
pistols
a
huge
bowie
knife
a
black
jack
and
a
pair
of
brass
knuckles
curtin
answered
youll
do
and
they
were
started
on
their
journey
after
all
the
telegraph
wires
had
been
cut
we
awaited
through
what
seemed
almost
an
endless
night
until
the
east
was
purpled
with
the
coming
of
another
day
when
colonel
scott
who
had
managed
the
whole
scheme
reunited
the
wires
and
soon
received
from
colonel
lamon
this
dispatch
plums
delivered
nuts
safely
which
gave
us
the
intensely
gratifying
information
that
lincoln
had
arrived
in
washington
of
all
the
presidents
of
the
united
states
and
indeed
of
all
the
great
statesmen
who
have
made
their
indelible
impress
upon
the
policy
of
the
republic
abraham
lincoln
stands
out
single
and
alone
in
his
individual
qualities
he
had
little
experience
in
statesmanship
when
he
was
called
to
the
presidency
he
had
only
a
few
years
of
service
in
the
state
legislature
of
illinois
and
a
single
term
in
congress
ending
twelve
years
before
he
became
president
but
he
had
to
grapple
with
the
gravest
problems
ever
presented
to
the
statesmanship
of
the
nation
for
solution
and
he
met
each
and
all
of
them
in
turn
with
the
most
consistent
mastery
and
settled
them
so
successfully
that
all
have
stood
unquestioned
until
the
present
time
and
are
certain
to
endure
while
the
republic
lives
in
this
he
surprised
not
only
his
own
cabinet
and
the
leaders
of
his
party
who
had
little
confidence
in
him
when
he
first
became
president
but
equally
surprised
the
country
and
the
world
he
was
patient
tireless
and
usually
silent
when
great
conflicts
raged
about
him
to
solve
the
appalling
problems
which
were
presented
at
various
stages
of
the
war
for
determination
and
when
he
reached
his
conclusion
he
was
inexorable
the
wrangles
of
faction
and
the
jostling
of
ambition
were
compelled
to
bow
when
lincoln
had
determined
upon
his
line
of
duty
he
was
much
more
than
a
statesman
he
was
one
of
the
most
sagacious
politicians
i
have
ever
known
although
he
was
entirely
unschooled
in
the
machinery
by
which
political
results
are
achieved
his
judgment
of
men
was
next
to
unerring
and
when
results
were
to
be
attained
he
knew
the
men
who
should
be
assigned
to
the
task
and
he
rarely
made
a
mistake
i
remember
one
occasion
when
he
summoned
colonel
forney
and
myself
to
confer
on
some
political
problem
he
opened
the
conversation
by
saying
you
know
that
i
never
was
much
of
a
conniver
i
dont
know
the
methods
of
political
management
and
i
can
only
trust
to
the
wisdom
of
leaders
to
accomplish
what
is
needed
lincolns
public
acts
are
familiar
to
every
schoolboy
of
the
nation
but
his
personal
attributes
which
are
so
strangely
distinguished
from
the
attributes
of
other
great
men
are
now
the
most
interesting
study
of
young
and
old
throughout
our
land
and
i
can
conceive
of
no
more
acceptable
presentation
to
the
public
than
a
compilation
of
anecdotes
and
incidents
pertaining
to
the
life
of
the
greatest
of
all

years

the

boy
also
became
the

inner
in

and
the
editor
testified
his
admiration
for
young
mcclures
attainments
by
sending
him
to
edit
a
new
weekly
paper
which
the
exigencies
of
politics
called
into
being
in

the

had

of

the
voice

knew
enough
about

not

of
any

that

he
made

went

made
that
a
success
studied
law
with
william
mclellan
and
made
that
a
success
and
actually
went
into
the
armyand
made
that
a
success
by
an
interesting
accident
which
brought
him
into
close
personal
relations
with
abraham
lincoln
whom
he
had
helped
to
nominate
serving
as
chairman
of
the
republican
state
committee
of

through
the
campaign

mcclure
working
day
and
night
at
harrisburg
saw
conscripts
coming
in
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
a
day
only
to
fret
in
idleness
against
the
army
redtape
which
held
them
there
instead
of
sending
a
regiment
a
day
to
the
front
as
mcclure
demanded
should
be
done
the
military
officer
continued
to
dispatch
two
companies
a
dayleaving
the
mass
of
the
conscripts
to
be
fed
by
the
contractors
mcclure
went
to
washington
and
said
to
the
president
you
must
send
a
mustering
officer
to
harrisburg
who
will
do
as
i
say
i
cant
stay
there
any
longer
under

sent

what

rank

said

bring

so

was

in

after
that

abe
lincolns
yarns
and
stories
lincoln
asked
to
be
shot
lincoln
was
naturally
enough
much
surprised
one
day
when
a
man
of
rather
forbidding
countenance
drew
a
revolver
and
thrust
the
weapon
almost
into
his
face
in
such
circumstances
abe
at
once
concluded
that
any
attempt
at
debate
or
argument
was
a
waste
of
time
and
words
what
seems
to
be
the
matter
inquired
lincoln
with
all
the
calmness
and
selfpossession
he
could
muster
well
replied
the
stranger
who
did
not
appear
at
all
excited
some
years
ago
i
swore
an
oath
that
if
i
ever
came
across
an
uglier
man
than
myself
id
shoot
him
on
the
spot
a
feeling
of
relief
evidently
took
possession
of
lincoln
at
this
rejoinder
as
the
expression
upon
his
countenance
lost
all
suggestion
of
anxiety
shoot
me
he
said
to
the
stranger
for
if
i
am
an
uglier
man
than
you
i
dont
want
to
live
time
lost
didnt
count
thurlow
weed
the
veteran
journalist
and
politician
once
related
how
when
he
was
opposing
the
claims
of
montgomery
blair
who
aspired
to
a
cabinet
appointment
that
mr
lincoln
inquired
of
mr
weed
whom
he
would
recommend
henry
winter
davis
was
the
response
david
davis
i
see
has
been
posting
you
up
on
this
question
retorted
lincoln
he
has
davis
on
the
brain
i
think
maryland
must
be
a
good
state
to
move
from
the
president
then
told
a
story
of
a
witness
in
court
in
a
neighboring
county
who
on
being
asked
his
age
replied
sixty
being
satisfied
he
was
much
older
the
question
was
repeated
and
on
receiving
the
same
answer
the
court
admonished
the
witness
saying
the
court
knows
you
to
be
much
older
than
sixty
oh
i
understand
now
was
the
rejoinder
youre
thinking
of
those
ten
years
i
spent
on
the
eastern
share
of
maryland
that
was
so
much
time
lost
and
didnt
count
blair
was
made
postmastergeneral
no
vices
no
virtues
lincoln
always
took
great
pleasure
in
relating
this
yarn
riding
at
one
time
in
a
stage
with
an
old
kentuckian
who
was
returning
from
missouri
lincoln
excited
the
old
gentlemans
surprise
by
refusing
to
accept
either
of
tobacco
or
french
brandy
when
they
separated
that
afternoonthe
kentuckian
to
take
another
stage
bound
for
louisvillehe
shook
hands
warmly
with
lincoln
and
said
goodhumoredly
see
here
stranger
youre
a
clever
but
strange
companion
i
may
never
see
you
again
and
i
dont
want
to
offend
you
but
i
want
to
say
this
my
experience
has
taught
me
that
a
man
who
has
no
vices
has
dd
few
virtues
goodday
lincolns
dues
miss
todd
afterwards
mrs
lincoln
had
a
keen
sense
of
the
ridiculous
and
wrote
several
articles
in
the
springfield
ill
journal
reflecting
severely
upon
general
james
shields
who
won
fame
in
the
mexican
and
civil
wars
and
was
united
states
senator
from
three
states
then
auditor
of
state
lincoln
assumed
the
authorship
and
was
challenged
by
shields
to
meet
him
on
the
field
of
honor
meanwhile
miss
todd
increased
shields
ire
by
writing
another
letter
to
the
paper
in
which
she
said
i
hear
the
way
of
these
fireeaters
is
to
give
the
challenged
party
the
choice
of
weapons
which
being
the
case
ill
tell
you
in
confidence
that
i
never
fight
with
anything
but
broomsticks
or
hot
water
or
a
shovelful
of
coals
the
former
of
which
being
somewhat
like
a
shillalah
may
not
be
objectionable
to
him
lincoln
accepted
the
challenge
and
selected
broadswords
as
the
weapons
judge
herndon
lincolns
law
partner
gives
the
closing
of
this
affair
as
follows
the
laws
of
illinois
prohibited
dueling
and
lincoln
demanded
that
the
meeting
should
be
outside
the
state
shields
undoubtedly
knew
that
lincoln
was
opposed
to
fighting
a
duelthat
his
moral
sense
would
revolt
at
the
thought
and
that
he
would
not
be
likely
to
break
the
law
by
fighting
in
the
state
possibly
he
thought
lincoln
would
make
a
humble
apology
shields
was
brave
but
foolish
and
would
not
listen
to
overtures
for
explanation
it
was
arranged
that
the
meeting
should
be
in
missouri
opposite
alton
they
proceeded
to
the
place
selected
but
friends
interfered
and
there
was
no
duel
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
man
who
had
swung
a
beetle
and
driven
iron
wedges
into
gnarled
hickory
logs
could
have
cleft
the
skull
of
his
antagonist
but
he
had
no
such
intention
he
repeatedly
said
to
the
friends
of
shields
that
in
writing
the
first
article
he
had
no
thought
of
anything
personal
the
auditors
vanity
had
been
sorely
wounded
by
the
second
letter
in
regard
to
which
lincoln
could
not
make
any
explanation
except
that
he
had
had
no
hand
in
writing
it
the
affair
set
all
springfield
to
laughing
at
shields
done
with
the
bible
lincoln
never
told
a
better
story
than
this
a
country
meetinghouse
that
was
used
once
a
month
was
quite
a
distance
from
any
other
house
the
preacher
an
oldline
baptist
was
dressed
in
coarse
linen
pantaloons
and
shirt
of
the
same
material
the
pants
manufactured
after
the
old
fashion
with
baggy
legs
and
a
flap
in
the
front
were
made
to
attach
to
his
frame
without
the
aid
of
suspenders
a
single
button
held
his
shirt
in
position
and
that
was
at
the
collar
he
rose
up
in
the
pulpit
and
with
a
loud
voice
announced
his
text
thus
i
am
the
christ
whom
i
shall
represent
today
about
this
time
a
little
blue
lizard
ran
up
his
roomy
pantaloons
the
old
preacher
not
wishing
to
interrupt
the
steady
flow
of
his
sermon
slapped
away
on
his
leg
expecting
to
arrest
the
intruder
but
his
efforts
were
unavailing
and
the
little
fellow
kept
on
ascending
higher
and
higher
continuing
the
sermon
the
preacher
loosened
the
central
button
which
graced
the
waistband
of
his
pantaloons
and
with
a
kick
off
came
that
easyfitting
garment
but
meanwhile
mr
lizard
had
passed
the
equatorial
line
of
the
waistband
and
was
calmly
exploring
that
part
of
the
preachers
anatomy
which
lay
underneath
the
back
of
his
shirt
things
were
now
growing
interesting
but
the
sermon
was
still
grinding
on
the
next
movement
on
the
preachers
part
was
for
the
collar
button
and
with
one
sweep
of
his
arm
off
came
the
tow
linen
shirt
the
congregation
sat
for
an
instant
as
if
dazed
at
length
one
old
lady
in
the
rear
part
of
the
room
rose
up
and
glancing
at
the
excited
object
in
the
pulpit
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
if
you
represent
christ
then
im
done
with
the
bible
his
knowledge
of
human
nature
once
when
lincoln
was
pleading
a
case
the
opposing
lawyer
had
all
the
advantage
of
the
law
the
weather
was
warm
and
his
opponent
as
was
admissible
in
frontier
courts
pulled
off
his
coat
and
vest
as
he
grew
warm
in
the
argument
at
that
time
shirts
with
buttons
behind
were
unusual
lincoln
took
in
the
situation
at
once
knowing
the
prejudices
of
the
primitive
people
against
pretension
of
all
sorts
or
any
affectation
of
superior
social
rank
arising
he
said
gentlemen
of
the
jury
having
justice
on
my
side
i
dont
think
you
will
be
at
all
influenced
by
the
gentlemans
pretended
knowledge
of
the
law
when
you
see
he
does
not
even
know
which
side
of
his
shirt
should
be
in
front
there
was
a
general
laugh
and
lincolns
case
was
won
a
mischievous
ox
president
lincoln
once
told
the
following
story
of
colonel
w
who
had
been
elected
to
the
legislature
and
had
also
been
judge
of
the
county
court
his
elevation
however
had
made
him
somewhat
pompous
and
he
became
very
fond
of
using
big
words
on
his
farm
he
had
a
very
large
and
mischievous
ox
called
big
brindle
which
very
frequently
broke
down
his
neighbors
fences
and
committed
other
depredations
much
to
the
colonels
annoyance
one
morning
after
breakfast
in
the
presence
of
lincoln
who
had
stayed
with
him
over
night
and
who
was
on
his
way
to
town
he
called
his
overseer
and
said
to
him
mr
allen
i
desire
you
to
impound
big
brindle
in
order
that
i
may
hear
no
animadversions
on
his
eternal
depredations
allen
bowed
and
walked
off
sorely
puzzled
to
know
what
the
colonel
wanted
him
to
do
after
colonel
w
left
for
town
he
went
to
his
wife
and
asked
her
what
the
colonel
meant
by
telling
him
to
impound
the
ox
why
he
meant
to
tell
you
to
put
him
in
a
pen
said
she
allen
left
to
perform
the
feat
for
it
was
no
inconsiderable
one
as
the
animal
was
wild
and
vicious
but
after
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
vexation
succeeded
well
said
he
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
and
soliloquizing
this
is
impounding
is
it
now
i
am
dead
sure
that
the
colonel
will
ask
me
if
i
impounded
big
brindle
and
ill
bet
i
puzzle
him
as
he
did
me
the
next
day
the
colonel
gave
a
dinner
party
and
as
he
was
not
aristocratic
allen
the
overseer
sat
down
with
the
company
after
the
second
or
third
glass
was
discussed
the
colonel
turned
to
the
overseer
and
said
eh
mr
allen
did
you
impound
big
brindle
sir
allen
straightened
himself
and
looking
around
at
the
company
replied
yes
i
did
sir
but
old
brindle
transcended
the
impanel
of
the
impound
and
scatterlophisticated
all
over
the
equanimity
of
the
forest
the
company
burst
into
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
while
the
colonels
face
reddened
with
discomfiture
what
do
you
mean
by
that
sir
demanded
the
colonel
why
i
mean
colonel
replied
allen
that
old
brindle
being
prognosticated
with
an
idea
of
the
cholera
ripped
and
teared
snorted
and
pawed
dirt
jumped
the
fence
tuck
to
the
woods
and
would
not
be
impounded
nohow
this
was
too
much
the
company
roared
again
the
colonel
being
forced
to
join
in
the
laughter
and
in
the
midst
of
the
jollity
allen
left
the
table
saying
to
himself
as
he
went
i
reckon
the
colonel
wont
ask
me
to
impound
any
more
oxen
the
presidential
chinfly
some
of
mr
lincolns
intimate
friends
once
called
his
attention
to
a
certain
member
of
his
cabinet
who
was
quietly
working
to
secure
a
nomination
for
the
presidency
although
knowing
that
mr
lincoln
was
to
be
a
candidate
for
reelection
his
friends
insisted
that
the
cabinet
officer
ought
to
be
made
to
give
up
his
presidential
aspirations
or
be
removed
from
office
the
situation
reminded
mr
lincoln
of
a
story
my
brother
and
i
he
said
were
once
plowing
corn
i
driving
the
horse
and
he
holding
the
plow
the
horse
was
lazy
but
on
one
occasion
he
rushed
across
the
field
so
that
i
with
my
long
legs
could
scarcely
keep
pace
with
him
on
reaching
the
end
of
the
furrow
i
found
an
enormous
chinfly
fastened
upon
him
and
knocked
him
off
my
brother
asked
me
what
i
did
that
for
i
told
him
i
didnt
want
the
old
horse
bitten
in
that
way
why
said
my
brother
thats
all
that
made
him
go
now
said
mr
lincoln
if
mr
has
a
presidential
chinfly
biting
him
im
not
going
to
knock
him
off
if
it
will
only
make
his
department
go
squire
baglys
precedent
mr
t
w
s
kidd
of
springfield
says
that
he
once
heard
a
lawyer
opposed
to
lincoln
trying
to
convince
a
jury
that
precedent
was
superior
to
law
and
that
custom
made
things
legal
in
all
cases
when
lincoln
arose
to
answer
him
he
told
the
jury
he
would
argue
his
case
in
the
same
way
old
squire
bagly
from
menard
came
into
my
office
and
said
lincoln
i
want
your
advice
as
a
lawyer
has
a
man
whats
been
elected
justice
of
the
peace
a
right
to
issue
a
marriage
license
i
told
him
he
had
not
when
the
old
squire
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
very
indignantly
and
said
lincoln
i
thought
you
was
a
lawyer
now
bob
thomas
and
me
had
a
bet
on
this
thing
and
we
agreed
to
let
you
decide
but
if
this
is
your
opinion
i
dont
want
it
for
i
know
a
thunderin
sight
better
for
i
have
been
squire
now
for
eight
years
and
have
done
it
all
the
time
hed
need
his
gun
when
the
president
early
in
the
war
was
anxious
about
the
defenses
of
washington
he
told
a
story
illustrating
his
feelings
in
the
case
general
scott
then
commanderinchief
of
the
united
states
army
had
but
men
two
guns
and
an
old
sloop
of
war
the
latter
anchored
in
the
potomac
with
which
to
protect
the
national
capital
and
the
president
was
uneasy
to
one
of
his
queries
as
to
the
safety
of
washington
general
scott
had
replied
it
has
been
ordained
mr
president
that
the
city
shall
not
be
captured
by
the
confederates
but
we
ought
to
have
more
men
and
guns
here
was
the
chief
executives
answer
the
confederates
are
not
such
fools
as
to
let
a
good
chance
to
capture
washington
go
by
and
even
if
it
has
been
ordained
that
the
city
is
safe
id
feel
easier
if
it
were
better
protected
all
this
reminds
me
of
the
old
trapper
out
in
the
west
who
had
been
assured
by
some
city
folks
who
had
hired
him
as
a
guide
that
all
matters
regarding
life
and
death
were
prearranged
it
is
ordained
said
one
of
the
party
to
the
old
trapper
that
you
are
to
die
at
a
certain
time
and
no
one
can
kill
you
before
that
time
if
you
met
a
thousand
indians
and
your
death
had
not
been
ordained
for
that
day
you
would
certainly
escape
i
dont
exactly
understand
this
ordained
business
was
the
trappers
reply
i
dont
care
to
run
no
risks
i
always
have
my
gun
with
me
so
that
if
i
come
across
some
reds
i
can
feel
sure
that
i
wont
cross
the
jordan
thout
taking
some
of
em
with
me
now
for
instance
if
i
met
an
indian
in
the
woods
he
drew
a
bead
on
mesayin
too
that
he
wasnt
moren
ten
feet
awayan
i
didnt
have
nothing
to
protect
myself
say
it
was
as
bad
as
that
the
redskin
bein
dead
ready
to
kill
me
now
even
if
it
had
been
ordained
that
the
indian
sayin
he
was
a
good
shot
was
to
die
that
very
minute
an
i
wasnt
what
would
i
do
thout
my
gun
there
you
are
the
president
remarked
even
if
it
has
been
ordained
that
the
city
of
washington
will
never
be
taken
by
the
southerners
what
would
we
do
in
case
they
made
an
attack
upon
the
place
without
men
and
heavy
guns
kept
up
the
argument
judge
t
lyle
dickey
of
illinois
related
that
when
the
excitement
over
the
kansas
nebraska
bill
first
broke
out
he
was
with
lincoln
and
several
friends
attending
court
one
evening
several
persons
including
himself
and
lincoln
were
discussing
the
slavery
question
judge
dickey
contended
that
slavery
was
an
institution
which
the
constitution
recognized
and
which
could
not
be
disturbed
lincoln
argued
that
ultimately
slavery
must
become
extinct
after
awhile
said
judge
dickey
we
went
upstairs
to
bed
there
were
two
beds
in
our
room
and
i
remember
that
lincoln
sat
up
in
his
night
shirt
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
arguing
the
point
with
me
at
last
we
went
to
sleep
early
in
the
morning
i
woke
up
and
there
was
lincoln
half
sitting
up
in
bed
dickey
said
he
i
tell
you
this
nation
cannot
exist
half
slave
and
half
free
oh
lincoln
said
i
go
to
sleep
equine
ingratitude
president
lincoln
while
eager
that
the
united
states
troops
should
be
supplied
with
the
most
modern
and
serviceable
weapons
often
took
occasion
to
put
his
foot
down
upon
the
mania
for
experimenting
with
which
some
of
his
generals
were
afflicted
while
engaged
in
these
experiments
much
valuable
time
was
wasted
the
enemy
was
left
to
do
as
he
thought
best
no
battles
were
fought
and
opportunities
for
winning
victories
allowed
to
pass
the
president
was
an
exceedingly
practical
man
and
when
an
invention
idea
or
discovery
was
submitted
to
him
his
first
step
was
to
ascertain
how
any
or
all
of
them
could
be
applied
in
a
way
to
be
of
benefit
to
the
army
as
to
experimenting
with
contrivances
which
to
his
mind
could
never
be
put
to
practical
use
he
had
little
patience
some
of
these
generals
said
he
experiment
so
long
and
so
much
with
newfangled
fancy
notions
that
when
they
are
finally
brought
to
a
head
they
are
useless
either
the
time
to
use
them
has
gone
by
or
the
machine
when
put
in
operation
kills
more
than
it
cures
one
of
these
generals
who
has
a
scheme
for
condensing
rations
is
willing
to
swear
his
life
away
that
his
idea
when
carried
to
perfection
will
reduce
the
cost
of
feeding
the
union
troops
to
almost
nothing
while
the
soldiers
themselves
will
get
so
fat
that
theyll
bust
out
of
their
uniforms
of
course
uniforms
cost
nothing
and
real
fat
men
are
more
active
and
vigorous
than
lean
skinny
ones
but
that
is
getting
away
from
my
story
there
was
once
an
irishmana
cabmanwho
had
a
notion
that
he
could
induce
his
horse
to
live
entirely
on
shavings
the
latter
he
could
get
for
nothing
while
corn
and
oats
were
pretty
highpriced
so
he
daily
lessened
the
amount
of
food
to
the
horse
substituting
shavings
for
the
corn
and
oats
abstracted
so
that
the
horse
wouldnt
know
his
rations
were
being
cut
down
however
just
as
he
had
achieved
success
in
his
experiment
and
the
horse
had
been
taught
to
live
without
other
food
than
shavings
the
ungrateful
animal
up
and
died
and
he
had
to
buy
another
so
far
as
this
general
referred
to
is
concerned
im
afraid
the
soldiers
will
all
be
dead
at
the
time
when
his
experiment
is
demonstrated
as
thoroughly
successful
twas
moving
day
speed
who
was
a
prosperous
young
merchant
of
springfield
reports
that
lincolns
personal
effects
consisted
of
a
pair
of
saddlebags
containing
two
or
three
lawbooks
and
a
few
pieces
of
clothing
riding
on
a
borrowed
horse
he
thus
made
his
appearance
in
springfield
when
he
discovered
that
a
single
bedstead
would
cost
seventeen
dollars
he
said
it
is
probably
cheap
enough
but
i
have
not
enough
money
to
pay
for
it
when
speed
offered
to
trust
him
he
said
if
i
fail
here
as
a
lawyer
i
will
probably
never
pay
you
at
all
then
speed
offered
to
share
large
double
bed
with
him
where
is
your
room
lincoln
asked
upstairs
said
speed
pointing
from
the
store
leading
to
his
room
without
saying
a
word
he
took
his
saddlebags
on
his
arm
went
upstairs
set
them
down
on
the
floor
came
down
again
and
with
a
face
beaming
with
pleasure
and
smiles
exclaimed
well
speed
im
moved
abes
hair
needed
combing
by
the
way
remarked
president
lincoln
one
day
to
colonel
cannon
a
close
personal
friend
i
can
tell
you
a
good
story
about
my
hair
when
i
was
nominated
at
chicago
an
enterprising
fellow
thought
that
a
great
many
people
would
like
to
see
how
abe
lincoln
looked
and
as
i
had
not
long
before
sat
for
a
photograph
the
fellow
having
seen
it
rushed
over
and
bought
the
negative
he
at
once
got
no
end
of
woodcuts
and
so
active
was
their
circulation
they
were
soon
selling
in
all
parts
of
the
country
soon
after
they
reached
springfield
i
heard
a
boy
crying
them
for
sale
on
the
streets
heres
your
likeness
of
abe
lincoln
he
shouted
buy
one
price
only
two
shillings
will
look
a
great
deal
better
when
he
gets
his
hair
combed
would
take
to
the
woods
secretary
of
state
seward
was
bothered
considerably
regarding
the
complication
into
which
spain
had
involved
the
united
states
government
in
connection
with
san
domingo
and
related
his
troubles
to
the
president
negotiations
were
not
proceeding
satisfactorily
and
things
were
mixed
generally
we
wished
to
conciliate
spain
while
the
negroes
had
appealed
against
spanish
oppression
the
president
did
not
to
all
appearances
look
at
the
matter
seriously
but
instead
of
treating
the
situation
as
a
grave
one
remarked
that
sewards
dilemma
reminded
him
of
an
interview
between
two
negroes
in
tennessee
one
was
a
preacher
who
with
the
crude
and
strange
notions
of
his
ignorant
race
was
endeavoring
to
admonish
and
enlighten
his
brother
african
of
the
importance
of
religion
and
the
danger
of
the
future
dar
are
said
josh
the
preacher
two
roads
befo
you
joe
be
caful
which
ob
dese
you
take
narrow
am
de
way
dat
leads
straight
to
destruction
but
broad
am
de
way
dat
leads
right
to
damnation
joe
opened
his
eyes
with
affright
and
under
the
spell
of
the
awful
danger
before
him
exclaimed
josh
take
which
road
you
please
i
shall
go
troo
de
woods
i
am
not
willing
concluded
the
president
to
assume
any
new
troubles
or
responsibilities
at
this
time
and
shall
therefore
avoid
going
to
the
one
place
with
spain
or
with
the
negro
to
the
other
but
shall
take
to
the
woods
we
will
maintain
an
honest
and
strict
neutrality
lincoln
carried
her
trunk
my
first
strong
impression
of
mr
lincoln
says
a
lady
of
springfield
was
made
by
one
of
his
kind
deeds
i
was
going
with
a
little
friend
for
my
first
trip
alone
on
the
railroad
cars
it
was
an
epoch
of
my
life
i
had
planned
for
it
and
dreamed
of
it
for
weeks
the
day
i
was
to
go
came
but
as
the
hour
of
the
train
approached
the
hackman
through
some
neglect
failed
to
call
for
my
trunk
as
the
minutes
went
on
i
realized
in
a
panic
of
grief
that
i
should
miss
the
train
i
was
standing
by
the
gate
my
hat
and
gloves
on
sobbing
as
if
my
heart
would
break
when
mr
lincoln
came
by
why
whats
the
matter
he
asked
and
i
poured
out
all
my
story
how
bigs
the
trunk
theres
still
time
if
it
isnt
too
big
and
he
pushed
through
the
gate
and
up
to
the
door
my
mother
and
i
took
him
up
to
my
room
where
my
little
oldfashioned
trunk
stood
locked
and
tied
oh
ho
he
cried
wipe
your
eyes
and
come
on
quick
and
before
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
had
shouldered
the
trunk
was
down
stairs
and
striding
out
of
the
yard
down
the
street
he
went
fast
as
his
long
legs
could
carry
him
i
trotting
behind
drying
my
tears
as
i
went
we
reached
the
station
in
time
mr
lincoln
put
me
on
the
train
kissed
me
goodbye
and
told
me
to
have
a
good
time
it
was
just
like
him
boat
had
to
stop
lincoln
never
failed
to
take
part
in
all
political
campaigns
in
illinois
as
his
reputation
as
a
speaker
caused
his
services
to
be
in
great
demand
as
was
natural
he
was
often
the
target
at
which
many
of
the
smart
alecks
of
that
period
shot
their
feeble
bolts
but
lincoln
was
so
ready
with
his
answers
that
few
of
them
cared
to
engage
him
a
second
time
in
one
campaign
lincoln
was
frequently
annoyed
by
a
young
man
who
entertained
the
idea
that
he
was
a
born
orator
he
had
a
loud
voice
was
full
of
language
and
so
conceited
that
he
could
not
understand
why
the
people
did
not
recognize
and
appreciate
his
abilities
this
callow
politician
delighted
in
interrupting
public
speakers
and
at
last
lincoln
determined
to
squelch
him
one
night
while
addressing
a
large
meeting
at
springfield
the
fellow
became
so
offensive
that
abe
dropped
the
threads
of
his
speech
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
tormentor
i
dont
object
said
lincoln
to
being
interrupted
with
sensible
questions
but
i
must
say
that
my
boisterous
friend
does
not
always
make
inquiries
which
properly
come
under
that
head
he
says
he
is
afflicted
with
headaches
at
which
i
dont
wonder
as
it
is
a
wellknown
fact
that
nature
abhors
a
vacuum
and
takes
her
own
way
of
demonstrating
it
this
noisy
friend
reminds
me
of
a
certain
steamboat
that
used
to
run
on
the
illinois
river
it
was
an
energetic
boat
was
always
busy
when
they
built
it
however
they
made
one
serious
mistake
this
error
being
in
the
relative
sizes
of
the
boiler
and
the
whistle
the
latter
was
usually
busy
too
and
people
were
aware
that
it
was
in
existence
this
particular
boiler
to
which
i
have
reference
was
a
sixfoot
one
and
did
all
that
was
required
of
it
in
the
way
of
pushing
the
boat
along
but
as
the
builders
of
the
vessel
had
made
the
whistle
a
sixfoot
one
the
consequence
was
that
every
time
the
whistle
blew
the
boat
had
to
stop
mcclellans
special
talent
president
lincoln
one
day
remarked
to
a
number
of
personal
friends
who
had
called
upon
him
at
the
white
house
general
mcclellans
tardiness
and
unwillingness
to
fight
the
enemy
or
follow
up
advantages
gained
reminds
me
of
a
man
back
in
illinois
who
knew
a
few
law
phrases
but
whose
lawyer
lacked
aggressiveness
the
man
finally
lost
all
patience
and
springing
to
his
feet
vociferated
why
dont
you
go
at
him
with
a
fi
fa
a
demurrer
a
capias
a
surrebutter
or
a
ne
exeat
or
something
or
a
nundam
pactum
or
a
non
est
i
wish
mcclellan
would
go
at
the
enemy
with
somethingi
dont
care
what
general
mcclellan
is
a
pleasant
and
scholarly
gentleman
he
is
an
admirable
engineer
but
he
seems
to
have
a
special
talent
for
a
stationary
engine
how
jake
got
away
one
of
the
last
if
not
the
very
last
story
told
by
president
lincoln
was
to
one
of
his
cabinet
who
came
to
see
him
to
ask
if
it
would
be
proper
to
permit
jake
thompson
to
slip
through
maine
in
disguise
and
embark
for
portland
the
president
as
usual
was
disposed
to
be
merciful
and
to
permit
the
archrebel
to
pass
unmolested
but
secretary
stanton
urged
that
he
should
be
arrested
as
a
traitor
by
permitting
him
to
escape
the
penalties
of
treason
persisted
the
war
secretary
you
sanction
it
well
replied
mr
lincoln
let
me
tell
you
a
story
there
was
an
irish
soldier
here
last
summer
who
wanted
something
to
drink
stronger
than
water
and
stopped
at
a
drugshop
where
he
espied
a
sodafountain
mr
doctor
said
he
give
me
plase
a
glass
of
sodawather
an
if
yez
can
put
in
a
few
drops
of
whiskey
unbeknown
to
any
one
ill
be
obleeged
now
continued
mr
lincoln
if
jake
thompson
is
permitted
to
go
through
maine
unbeknown
to
any
one
whats
the
harm
so
dont
have
him
arrested
more
light
and
less
noise
the
president
was
bothered
to
death
by
those
persons
who
boisterously
demanded
that
the
war
be
pushed
vigorously
also
those
who
shouted
their
advice
and
opinions
into
his
weary
ears
but
who
never
suggested
anything
practical
these
fellows
were
not
in
the
army
nor
did
they
ever
take
any
interest
in
a
personal
way
in
military
matters
except
when
engaged
in
dodging
drafts
that
reminds
me
remarked
mr
lincoln
one
day
of
a
farmer
who
lost
his
way
on
the
western
frontier
night
came
on
and
the
embarrassments
of
his
position
were
increased
by
a
furious
tempest
which
suddenly
burst
upon
him
to
add
to
his
discomfort
his
horse
had
given
out
leaving
him
exposed
to
all
the
dangers
of
the
pitiless
storm
the
peals
of
thunder
were
terrific
the
frequent
flashes
of
lightning
affording
the
only
guide
on
the
road
as
he
resolutely
trudged
onward
leading
his
jaded
steed
the
earth
seemed
fairly
to
tremble
beneath
him
in
the
war
of
elements
one
bolt
threw
him
suddenly
upon
his
knees
our
traveler
was
not
a
prayerful
man
but
finding
himself
involuntarily
brought
to
an
attitude
of
devotion
he
addressed
himself
to
the
throne
of
grace
in
the
following
prayer
for
his
deliverance
o
god
hear
my
prayer
this
time
for
thou
knowest
it
is
not
often
that
i
call
upon
thee
and
o
lord
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
thee
give
us
a
little
more
light
and
a
little
less
noise
i
wish
the
president
said
sadly
there
was
a
stronger
disposition
manifested
on
the
part
of
our
civilian
warriors
to
unite
in
suppressing
the
rebellion
and
a
little
less
noise
as
to
how
and
by
whom
the
chief
executive
office
shall
be
administered
one
bullet
and
a
hatful
lincoln
made
the
best
of
everything
and
if
he
couldnt
get
what
he
wanted
he
took
what
he
could
get
in
matters
of
policy
while
president
he
acted
according
to
this
rule
he
would
take
perilous
chances
even
when
the
result
was
to
the
minds
of
his
friends
not
worth
the
risk
he
had
run
one
day
at
a
meeting
of
the
cabinet
it
being
at
the
time
when
it
seemed
as
though
war
with
england
and
france
could
not
be
avoided
secretary
of
state
seward
and
secretary
of
war
stanton
warmly
advocated
that
the
united
states
maintain
an
attitude
the
result
of
which
would
have
been
a
declaration
of
hostilities
by
the
european
powers
mentioned
why
take
any
more
chances
than
are
absolutely
necessary
asked
the
president
we
must
maintain
our
honor
at
any
cost
insisted
secretary
seward
we
would
be
branded
as
cowards
before
the
entire
world
secretary
stanton
said
but
why
run
the
greater
risk
when
we
can
take
a
smaller
one
queried
the
president
calmly
the
less
risk
we
run
the
better
for
us
that
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
heard
a
day
or
two
ago
the
hero
of
which
was
on
the
firing
line
during
a
recent
battle
where
the
bullets
were
flying
thick
finally
his
courage
gave
way
entirely
and
throwing
down
his
gun
he
ran
for
dear
life
as
he
was
flying
along
at
top
speed
he
came
across
an
officer
who
drew
his
revolver
and
shouted
go
back
to
your
regiment
at
once
or
i
will
shoot
you
shoot
and
be
hanged
the
racer
exclaimed
whats
one
bullet
to
a
whole
hatful
lincolns
story
to
peace
commissioners
among
the
reminiscences
of
lincoln
left
by
editor
henry
j
raymond
is
the
following
among
the
stories
told
by
lincoln
which
is
freshest
in
my
mind
one
which
he
related
to
me
shortly
after
its
occurrence
belongs
to
the
history
of
the
famous
interview
on
board
the
river
queen
at
hampton
roads
between
himself
and
secretary
seward
and
the
rebel
peace
commissioners
it
was
reported
at
the
time
that
the
president
told
a
little
story
on
that
occasion
and
the
inquiry
went
around
among
the
newspapers
what
was
it
the
new
york
herald
published
what
purported
to
be
a
version
of
it
but
the
point
was
entirely
lost
and
it
attracted
no
attention
being
in
washington
a
few
days
subsequent
to
the
interview
with
the
commissioners
my
previous
sojourn
there
having
terminated
about
the
first
of
last
august
i
asked
mr
lincoln
one
day
if
it
was
true
that
he
told
stephens
hunter
and
campbell
a
story
why
yes
he
replied
manifesting
some
surprise
but
has
it
leaked
out
i
was
in
hopes
nothing
would
be
said
about
it
lest
some
oversensitive
people
should
imagine
there
was
a
degree
of
levity
in
the
intercourse
between
us
he
then
went
on
to
relate
the
circumstances
which
called
it
out
you
see
said
he
we
had
reached
and
were
discussing
the
slavery
question
mr
hunter
said
substantially
that
the
slaves
always
accustomed
to
an
overseer
and
to
work
upon
compulsion
suddenly
freed
as
they
would
be
if
the
south
should
consent
to
peace
on
the
basis
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
would
precipitate
not
only
themselves
but
the
entire
southern
society
into
irremediable
ruin
no
work
would
be
done
nothing
would
be
cultivated
and
both
blacks
and
whites
would
starve
said
the
president
i
waited
for
seward
to
answer
that
argument
but
as
he
was
silent
i
at
length
said
mr
hunter
you
ought
to
know
a
great
deal
better
about
this
argument
than
i
for
you
have
always
lived
under
the
slave
system
i
can
only
say
in
reply
to
your
statement
of
the
case
that
it
reminds
me
of
a
man
out
in
illinois
by
the
name
of
case
who
undertook
a
few
years
ago
to
raise
a
very
large
herd
of
hogs
it
was
a
great
trouble
to
feed
them
and
how
to
get
around
this
was
a
puzzle
to
him
at
length
he
hit
on
the
plan
of
planting
an
immense
field
of
potatoes
and
when
they
were
sufficiently
grown
he
turned
the
whole
herd
into
the
field
and
let
them
have
full
swing
thus
saving
not
only
the
labor
of
feeding
the
hogs
but
also
that
of
digging
the
potatoes
charmed
with
his
sagacity
he
stood
one
day
leaning
against
the
fence
counting
his
hogs
when
a
neighbor
came
along
well
well
said
he
mr
case
this
is
all
very
fine
your
hogs
are
doing
very
well
just
now
but
you
know
out
here
in
illinois
the
frost
comes
early
and
the
ground
freezes
for
a
foot
deep
then
what
you
going
to
do
this
was
a
view
of
the
matter
which
mr
case
had
not
taken
into
account
butchering
time
for
hogs
was
way
on
in
december
or
january
he
scratched
his
head
and
at
length
stammered
well
it
may
come
pretty
hard
on
their
snouts
but
i
dont
see
but
that
it
will
be
root
hog
or
die
abe
got
the
worst
of
it
when
lincoln
was
a
young
lawyer
in
illinois
he
and
a
certain
judge
once
got
to
bantering
one
another
about
trading
horses
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
next
morning
at
nine
oclock
they
should
make
a
trade
the
horses
to
be
unseen
up
to
that
hour
and
no
backing
out
under
a
forfeiture
of
at
the
hour
appointed
the
judge
came
up
leading
the
sorriestlooking
specimen
of
a
horse
ever
seen
in
those
parts
in
a
few
minutes
mr
lincoln
was
seen
approaching
with
a
wooden
sawhorse
upon
his
shoulders
great
were
the
shouts
and
laughter
of
the
crowd
and
both
were
greatly
increased
when
lincoln
on
surveying
the
judges
animal
set
down
his
sawhorse
and
exclaimed
well
judge
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
got
the
worst
of
it
in
a
horse
trade
it
depended
upon
his
condition
the
president
had
made
arrangements
to
visit
new
york
and
was
told
that
president
garrett
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
would
be
glad
to
furnish
a
special
train
i
dont
doubt
it
a
bit
remarked
the
president
for
i
know
mr
garrett
and
like
him
very
well
and
if
i
believedwhich
i
dont
by
any
meansall
the
things
some
people
say
about
his
secesh
principles
he
might
say
to
you
as
was
said
by
the
superintendent
of
a
certain
railroad
to
a
son
of
one
my
predecessors
in
office
some
two
years
after
the
death
of
president
harrison
the
son
of
his
successor
in
this
office
wanted
to
take
his
father
on
an
excursion
somewhere
or
other
and
went
to
the
superintendents
office
to
order
a
special
train
this
superintendent
was
a
whig
of
the
most
uncompromising
sort
who
hated
a
democrat
more
than
all
other
things
on
the
earth
and
promptly
refused
the
young
mans
request
his
language
being
to
the
effect
that
this
particular
railroad
was
not
running
special
trains
for
the
accommodation
of
presidents
of
the
united
states
just
at
that
season
the
son
of
the
president
was
much
surprised
and
exceedingly
annoyed
why
he
said
you
have
run
special
presidential
trains
and
i
know
it
didnt
you
furnish
a
special
train
for
the
funeral
of
president
harrison
certainly
we
did
calmly
replied
the
superintendent
with
no
relaxation
of
his
features
and
if
you
will
only
bring
your
father
here
in
the
same
shape
as
general
harrison
was
you
shall
have
the
best
train
on
the
road
when
the
laughter
had
subsided
the
president
said
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
accepting
mr
garretts
offer
as
i
have
no
doubts
whatever
as
to
his
loyalty
to
the
united
states
government
or
his
respect
for
the
occupant
of
the
presidential
office
got
down
to
the
raisins
a
b
chandler
chief
of
the
telegraph
office
at
the
war
department
occupied
three
rooms
one
of
which
was
called
the
presidents
room
so
much
of
his
time
did
mr
lincoln
spend
there
here
he
would
read
over
the
telegrams
received
for
the
several
heads
of
departments
three
copies
of
all
messages
received
were
madeone
for
the
president
one
for
the
war
department
records
and
one
for
secretary
stanton
mr
chandler
told
a
story
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
president
read
the
despatches
president
lincolns
copies
were
kept
in
what
we
called
the
presidents
drawer
of
the
cipher
desk
he
would
come
in
at
any
time
of
the
night
or
day
and
go
at
once
to
this
drawer
and
take
out
a
file
of
telegrams
and
begin
at
the
top
to
read
them
his
position
in
running
over
these
telegrams
was
sometimes
very
curious
he
had
a
habit
of
sitting
frequently
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
with
his
right
knee
dragged
down
to
the
floor
i
remember
a
curious
expression
of
his
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
new
telegrams
and
began
on
those
that
he
had
read
before
it
was
well
i
guess
i
have
got
down
to
the
raisins
the
first
two
or
three
times
he
said
this
he
made
no
explanation
and
i
did
not
ask
one
but
one
day
after
he
had
made
the
remark
he
looked
up
under
his
eyebrows
at
me
with
a
funny
twinkle
in
his
eyes
and
said
i
used
to
know
a
little
girl
out
west
who
sometimes
was
inclined
to
eat
too
much
one
day
she
ate
a
good
many
more
raisins
than
she
ought
to
and
followed
them
up
with
a
quantity
of
other
goodies
they
made
her
very
sick
after
a
time
the
raisins
began
to
come
she
gasped
and
looked
at
her
mother
and
said
well
i
will
be
better
now
i
guess
for
i
have
got
down
to
the
raisins

taking

on
the

was
one
of
the
cartoons
published
in
by
one
of
the
illustrated
periodicals
as
may
be
seen
it
represents
lincoln
in
a
political
oyster
house
preparing
to
swallow
two
of
his
democratic
opponents
for
the
presidencydouglas
and
breckinridge
he
performed
the
feat
at
the
november
election
the
democratic
party
was
hopelessly
split
in
the
northern
wing
nominated
stephen
a
douglas
of
illinois
as
their
candidate
the
southern
wing
naming
john
c
breckinridge
of
kentucky
the
constitutional
unionists
the
old
american
of
knownothing
party
placed
john
bell
of
tennessee
in
the
field
and
against
these
was
put
abraham
lincoln
who
received
the
support
of
the
abolitionists
lincoln
made
short
work
of
his
antagonists
when
the
election
came
around
he
received
a
large
majority
in
the
electoral
college
while
nearly
every
northern
state
voted
majorities
for
him
at
the
polls
douglas
had
but
twelve
votes
in
the
electoral
college
while
bell
had
thirtynine
the
votes
of
the
southern
states
then
preparing
to
secede
were
for
the
most
part
thrown
for

over

saving

judge
h
w
beckwith
of
danville
ill
said
that
soon
after
the
ottawa
debate
between
lincoln
and
douglas
he
passed
the
chenery
house
then
the
principal
hotel
in
springfield
the
lobby
was
crowded
with
partisan
leaders
from
various
sections
of
the
state
and
mr
lincoln
from
his
greater
height
was
seen
above
the
surging
mass
that
clung
about
him
like
a
swarm
of
bees
to
their
ruler
the
day
was
warm
and
at
the
first
chance
he
broke
away
and
came
out
for
a
little
fresh
air
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
face
as
he
passed
the
door
he
saw
me
said
judge
beckwith
and
taking
my
hand
inquired
for
the
health
and
views
of
his
friends
over
in
vermillion
county
he
was
assured
they
were
wide
awake
and
further
told
that
they
looked
forward
to
the
debate
between
him
and
senator
douglas
with
deep
concern
from
the
shadow
that
went
quickly
over
his
face
the
pained
look
that
came
to
give
way
quickly
to
a
blaze
of
eyes
and
quiver
of
lips
i
felt
that
mr
lincoln
had
gone
beneath
my
mere
words
and
caught
my
inner
and
current
fears
as
to
the
result
and
then
in
a
forgiving
jocular
way
peculiar
to
him
he
said
sit
down
i
have
a
moment
to
spare
and
will
tell
you
a
story
having
been
on
his
feet
for
some
time
he
sat
on
the
end
of
the
stone
step
leading
into
the
hotel
door
while
i
stood
closely
fronting
him
you
have
he
continued
seen
two
men
about
to
fight
yes
many
times
well
one
of
them
brags
about
what
he
means
to
do
he
jumps
high
in
the
air
cracking
his
heels
together
smites
his
fists
and
wastes
his
wreath
trying
to
scare
somebody
you
see
the
other
fellow
he
says
not
a
wordhere
mr
lincolns
voice
and
manner
changed
to
great
earnestness
and
repeatingyou
see
the
other
man
says
not
a
word
his
arms
are
at
his
sides
his
fists
are
closely
doubled
up
his
head
is
drawn
to
the
shoulder
and
his
teeth
are
set
firm
together
he
is
saving
his
wind
for
the
fight
and
as
sure
as
it
comes
off
he
will
win
it
or
die
atrying
right
for
once
anyhow
where
men
bred
in
courts
accustomed
to
the
world
or
versed
in
diplomacy
would
use
some
subterfuge
or
would
make
a
polite
speech
or
give
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
as
the
means
of
getting
out
of
an
embarrassing
position
lincoln
raised
a
laugh
by
some
bold
westcountry
anecdote
and
moved
off
in
the
cloud
of
merriment
produced
by
the
joke
when
attorneygeneral
bates
was
remonstrating
apparently
against
the
appointment
of
some
indifferent
lawyer
to
a
place
of
judicial
importance
the
president
interposed
with
come
now
bates
hes
not
half
as
bad
as
you
think
besides
that
i
must
tell
you
he
did
me
a
good
turn
long
ago
when
i
took
to
the
law
i
was
going
to
court
one
morning
with
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
of
bad
road
before
me
and
i
had
no
horse
the
judge
overtook
me
in
his
carriage
hallo
lincoln
are
you
not
going
to
the
courthouse
come
in
and
i
will
give
you
a
seat
well
i
got
in
and
the
judge
went
on
reading
his
papers
presently
the
carriage
struck
a
stump
on
one
side
of
the
road
then
it
hopped
off
to
the
other
i
looked
out
and
i
saw
the
driver
was
jerking
from
side
to
side
in
his
seat
so
i
says
judge
i
think
your
coachman
has
been
taking
a
little
too
much
this
morning
well
i
declare
lincoln
said
he
i
should
not
much
wonder
if
you
were
right
for
he
has
nearly
upset
me
half
a
dozen
times
since
starting
so
putting
his
head
out
of
the
window
he
shouted
why
you
infernal
scoundrel
you
are
drunk
upon
which
pulling
up
his
horses
and
turning
round
with
great
gravity
the
coachman
said
begorra
thats
the
first
rightful
decision
that
you
have
given
for
the
last
twelvemonth
while
the
company
were
laughing
the
president
beat
a
quiet
retreat
from
the
neighborhood
pity
the
poor
orphan
after
the
war
was
well
on
and
several
battles
had
been
fought
a
lady
from
alexandria
asked
the
president
for
an
order
to
release
a
certain
church
which
had
been
taken
for
a
federal
hospital
the
president
said
he
could
do
nothing
as
the
post
surgeon
at
alexandria
was
immovable
and
then
asked
the
lady
why
she
did
not
donate
money
to
build
a
hospital
we
have
been
very
much
embarrassed
by
the
war
she
replied
and
our
estates
are
much
hampered
you
are
not
ruined
asked
the
president
no
sir
but
we
do
not
feel
that
we
should
give
up
anything
we
have
left
the
president
after
some
reflection
then
said
there
are
more
battles
yet
to
be
fought
and
i
think
god
would
prefer
that
your
church
be
devoted
to
the
care
and
alleviation
of
the
sufferings
of
our
poor
fellows
so
madam
you
will
excuse
me
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
afterward
in
speaking
of
this
incident
president
lincoln
said
that
the
lady
as
a
representative
of
her
class
in
alexandria
reminded
him
of
the
story
of
the
young
man
who
had
an
aged
father
and
mother
owning
considerable
property
the
young
man
being
an
only
son
and
believing
that
the
old
people
had
outlived
their
usefulness
assassinated
them
both
he
was
accused
tried
and
convicted
of
the
murder
when
the
judge
came
to
pass
sentence
upon
him
and
called
upon
him
to
give
any
reason
he
might
have
why
the
sentence
of
death
should
not
be
passed
upon
him
he
with
great
promptness
replied
that
he
hoped
the
court
would
be
lenient
upon
him
because
he
was
a
poor
orphan
bap
mcnabbs
booster
it
is
true
that
lincoln
did
not
drink
never
swore
was
a
stranger
to
smoking
and
lived
a
moral
life
generally
but
he
did
like
horseracing
and
chicken
fighting
new
salem
illinois
where
lincoln
was
clerking
was
known
the
neighborhood
around
as
a
fast
town
and
the
average
young
man
made
no
very
desperate
resistance
when
tempted
to
join
in
the
drinking
and
gambling
bouts
bap
mcnabb
was
famous
for
his
ability
in
both
the
raising
and
the
purchase
of
roosters
of
prime
fighting
quality
and
when
his
birds
fought
the
attendance
was
large
it
was
because
of
the
flunking
of
one
of
baps
roosters
that
lincoln
was
enabled
to
make
a
point
when
criticising
mcclellans
unreadiness
and
lack
of
energy
one
night
there
was
a
fight
on
the
schedule
one
of
bap
mcnabbs
birds
being
a
contestant
bap
brought
a
little
red
rooster
whose
fighting
qualities
had
been
well
advertised
for
days
in
advance
and
much
interest
was
manifested
in
the
outcome
as
the
result
of
these
contests
was
generally
a
quarrel
in
which
each
man
charging
foul
play
seized
his
victim
they
chose
lincoln
umpire
relying
not
only
on
his
fairness
but
his
ability
to
enforce
his
decisions
judge
herndon
in
his
abraham
lincoln
says
of
this
notable
event
i
cannot
improve
on
the
description
furnished
me
in
february
by
one
who
was
present
they
formed
a
ring
and
the
time
having
arrived
lincoln
with
one
hand
on
each
hip
and
in
a
squatting
position
cried
ready
into
the
ring
they
toss
their
fowls
baps
red
rooster
along
with
the
rest
but
no
sooner
had
the
little
beauty
discovered
what
was
to
be
done
than
he
dropped
his
tail
and
ran
the
crowd
cheered
while
bap
in
disappointment
picked
him
up
and
started
away
losing
his
quarter
entrance
fee
and
carrying
home
his
dishonored
fowl
once
arrived
at
the
latter
place
he
threw
his
pet
down
with
a
feeling
of
indignation
and
chagrin
the
little
fellow
out
of
sight
of
all
rivals
mounted
a
woodpile
and
proudly
flirting
out
his
feathers
crowed
with
all
his
might
bap
looked
on
in
disgust
yes
you
little
cuss
he
exclaimed
irreverently
youre
great
on
dress
parade
but
not
worth
a
darn
in
a
fight
it
is
said
according
to
judge
herndon
that
lincoln
considered
mcclellan
as
great
on
dress
parade
but
not
so
much
in
a
fight
a
lowdown
trick
when
lincoln
was
a
candidate
of
the
know
nothings
for
the
state
legislature
the
party
was
overconfident
and
the
democrats
pursued
a
stillhunt
lincoln
was
defeated
he
compared
the
situation
to
one
of
the
campfollowers
of
general
taylors
army
who
had
secured
a
barrel
of
cider
erected
a
tent
and
commenced
selling
it
to
the
thirsty
soldiers
at
twentyfive
cents
a
drink
but
he
had
sold
but
little
before
another
sharp
one
set
up
a
tent
at
his
back
and
tapped
the
barrel
so
as
to
flow
on
his
side
and
peddled
out
no
cider
at
five
cents
a
drink
of
course
getting
the
latters
entire
trade
on
the
borrowed
capital
the
democrats
said
mr
lincoln
had
played
knownothing
on
a
cheaper
scale
than
had
the
real
devotees
of
sam
and
had
raked
down
his
pile
with
his
own
cider
end
for
end
judge
h
w
beckwith
of
danville
ill
in
his
personal
recollections
of
lincoln
tells
a
story
which
is
a
good
example
of
lincolns
way
of
condensing
the
law
and
the
facts
of
an
issue
in
a
story
a
man
by
vile
words
first
provoked
and
then
made
a
bodily
attack
upon
another
the
latter
in
defending
himself
gave
the
other
much
the
worst
of
the
encounter
the
aggressor
to
get
even
had
the
one
who
thrashed
him
tried
in
our
circuit
court
on
a
charge
of
an
assault
and
battery
mr
lincoln
defended
and
told
the
jury
that
his
client
was
in
the
fix
of
a
man
who
in
going
along
the
highway
with
a
pitchfork
on
his
shoulder
was
attacked
by
a
fierce
dog
that
ran
out
at
him
from
a
farmers
dooryard
in
parrying
off
the
brute
with
the
fork
its
prongs
stuck
into
the
brute
and
killed
him
what
made
you
kill
my
dog
said
the
farmer
what
made
him
try
to
bite
me
but
why
did
you
not
go
at
him
with
the
other
end
of
the
pitchfork
why
did
he
not
come
after
me
with
his
other
end
at
this
mr
lincoln
whirled
about
in
his
long
arms
an
imaginary
dog
and
pushed
its
tail
end
toward
the
jury
this
was
the
defensive
plea
of
son
assault
demesneloosely
that
the
other
fellow
brought
on
the
fightquickly
told
and
in
a
way
the
dullest
mind
would
grasp
and
retain
let
six
skunks
go
the
president
had
decided
to
select
a
new
war
minister
and
the
leading
republican
senators
thought
the
occasion
was
opportune
to
change
the
whole
seven
cabinet
ministers
they
therefore
earnestly
advised
him
to
make
a
clean
sweep
and
select
seven
new
men
and
so
restore
the
waning
confidence
of
the
country
the
president
listened
with
patient
courtesy
and
when
the
senators
had
concluded
he
said
with
a
characteristic
gleam
of
humor
in
his
eye
gentlemen
your
request
for
a
change
of
the
whole
cabinet
because
i
have
made
one
change
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
once
heard
in
illinois
of
a
farmer
who
was
much
troubled
by
skunks
his
wife
insisted
on
his
trying
to
get
rid
of
them
he
loaded
his
shotgun
one
moonlight
night
and
awaited
developments
after
some
time
the
wife
heard
the
shotgun
go
off
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
farmer
entered
the
house
what
luck
have
you
asked
she
i
hid
myself
behind
the
woodpile
said
the
old
man
with
the
shotgun
pointed
towards
the
hen
roost
and
before
long
there
appeared
not
one
skunk
but
seven
i
took
aim
blazed
away
killed
one
and
he
raised
such
a
fearful
smell
that
i
concluded
it
was
best
to
let
the
other
six
go
the
senators
laughed
and
retired
how
he
got
blackstone
the
following
story
was
told
by
mr
lincoln
to
mr
a
j
conant
the
artist
who
painted
his
portrait
in
springfield
in
one
day
a
man
who
was
migrating
to
the
west
drove
up
in
front
of
my
store
with
a
wagon
which
contained
his
family
and
household
plunder
he
asked
me
if
i
would
buy
an
old
barrel
for
which
he
had
no
room
in
his
wagon
and
which
he
said
contained
nothing
of
special
value
i
did
not
want
it
but
to
oblige
him
i
bought
it
and
paid
him
i
think
half
a
dollar
for
it
without
further
examination
i
put
it
away
in
the
store
and
forgot
all
about
it
some
time
after
in
overhauling
things
i
came
upon
the
barrel
and
emptying
it
upon
the
floor
to
see
what
it
contained
i
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
rubbish
a
complete
edition
of
blackstones
commentaries
i
began
to
read
those
famous
works
and
i
had
plenty
of
time
for
during
the
long
summer
days
when
the
farmers
were
busy
with
their
crops
my
customers
were
few
and
far
between
the
more
i
readthis
he
said
with
unusual
emphasisthe
more
intensely
interested
i
became
never
in
my
whole
life
was
my
mind
so
thoroughly
absorbed
i
read
until
i
devoured
them
a
job
for
the
new
cabinetmaker
this
cartoon
labeled
a
job
for
the
new
cabinetmaker
was
printed
in
frank
leslies
illustrated
newspaper
on
february
d
a
month
and
two
days
before
abraham
lincoln
was
inaugurated
president
of
the
united
states
the
southern
states
had
seceded
from
the
union
the
confederacy
was
established
with
jefferson
davis
as
its
president
the
union
had
been
split
in
two
and
the
task
lincoln
had
before
him
was
to
glue
the
two
parts
of
the
republic
together
in
his
famous
speech
delivered
a
short
time
before
his
nomination
for
the
presidency
by
the
republican
national
convention
at
chicago
in
lincoln
had
said
a
house
divided
against
itself
cannot
stand
this
nation
cannot
exist
half
slave
and
half
free
after
his
inauguration
as
president
mr
lincoln
went
to
work
to
glue
the
two
pieces
together
and
after
four
years
of
bloody
war
and
at
immense
cost
the
job
was
finished
the
house
of
the
great
american
republic
was
no
longer
divided
the
severed
sectionsthe
north
and
the
southwere
cemented
tightly
the
slaves
were
freed
peace
was
firmly
established
and
the
union
of
states
was
glued
together
so
well
that
the
nation
is
stronger
now
than
ever
before
lincoln
was
just
the
man
for
that
job
and
the
work
he
did
will
last
for
all
time
the
new
cabinetmaker
knew
his
business
thoroughly
and
finished
his
task
of
glueing
in
a
workmanlike
manner
at
the
very
moment
of
its
completion
five
days
after
the
surrender
of
lee
to
grant
at
appomattox
the
martyr
president
fell
at
the
hands
of
the
assassin
j
wilkes
booth
i
can
stand
it
if
they
can
united
states
senator
benjamin
wade
of
ohio
henry
winter
davis
of
maryland
and
wendell
phillips
were
strongly
opposed
to
president
lincolns
reelection
and
wade
and
davis
issued
a
manifesto
phillips
made
several
warm
speeches
against
lincoln
and
his
policy
when
asked
if
he
had
read
the
manifesto
or
any
of
phillips
speeches
the
president
replied
i
have
not
seen
them
nor
do
i
care
to
see
them
i
have
seen
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
i
am
a
failure
not
only
in
the
opinion
of
the
people
in
rebellion
but
of
many
distinguished
politicians
of
my
own
party
but
time
will
show
whether
i
am
right
or
they
are
right
and
i
am
content
to
abide
its
decision
i
have
enough
to
look
after
without
giving
much
of
my
time
to
the
consideration
of
the
subject
of
who
shall
be
my
successor
in
office
the
position
is
not
an
easy
one
and
the
occupant
whoever
he
may
be
for
the
next
four
years
will
have
little
leisure
to
pluck
a
thorn
or
plant
a
rose
in
his
own
pathway
it
was
urged
that
this
opposition
must
be
embarrassing
to
his
administration
as
well
as
damaging
to
the
party
he
replied
yes
that
is
true
but
our
friends
wade
davis
phillips
and
others
are
hard
to
please
i
am
not
capable
of
doing
so
i
cannot
please
them
without
wantonly
violating
not
only
my
oath
but
the
most
vital
principles
upon
which
our
government
was
founded
as
to
those
who
like
wade
and
the
rest
see
fit
to
depreciate
my
policy
and
cavil
at
my
official
acts
i
shall
not
complain
of
them
i
accord
them
the
utmost
freedom
of
speech
and
liberty
of
the
press
but
shall
not
change
the
policy
i
have
adopted
in
the
full
belief
that
i
am
right
i
feel
on
this
subject
as
an
old
illinois
farmer
once
expressed
himself
while
eating
cheese
he
was
interrupted
in
the
midst
of
his
repast
by
the
entrance
of
his
son
who
exclaimed
hold
on
dad
theres
skippers
in
that
cheese
youre
eating
never
mind
tom
said
he
as
he
kept
on
munching
his
cheese
if
they
can
stand
it
i
can
lincoln
mistaken
for
once
president
lincoln
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
he
made
at
least
one
mistake
in
sizing
up
men
one
day
a
very
dignified
man
called
at
the
white
house
and
lincolns
heart
fell
when
his
visitor
approached
the
latter
was
portly
his
face
was
full
of
apparent
anxiety
and
lincoln
was
willing
to
wager
a
years
salary
that
he
represented
some
society
for
the
easy
and
speedy
repression
of
rebellions
the
caller
talked
fluently
but
at
no
time
did
he
give
advice
or
suggest
a
way
to
put
down
the
confederacy
he
was
full
of
humor
told
a
clever
story
or
two
and
was
entirely
selfpossessed
at
length
the
president
inquired
you
are
a
clergyman
are
you
not
sir
not
by
a
jug
full
returned
the
stranger
heartily
grasping
him
by
the
hand
lincoln
shook
it
until
the
visitor
squirmed
you
must
lunch
with
us
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
was
afraid
you
were
a
preacher
i
went
to
the
chicago
convention
the
caller
said
as
a
friend
of
mr
seward
i
have
watched
you
narrowly
ever
since
your
inauguration
and
i
called
merely
to
pay
my
respects
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
i
think
you
are
doing
everything
for
the
good
of
the
country
that
is
in
the
power
of
man
to
do
you
are
on
the
right
track
as
one
of
your
constituents
i
now
say
to
you
do
in
future
as
you
d
please
and
i
will
support
you
this
was
spoken
with
tremendous
effect
why
said
mr
lincoln
in
great
astonishment
i
took
you
to
be
a
preacher
i
thought
you
had
come
here
to
tell
me
how
to
take
richmond
and
he
again
grasped
the
hand
of
his
strange
visitor
accurate
and
penetrating
as
mr
lincolns
judgment
was
concerning
men
for
once
he
had
been
wholly
mistaken
the
scene
was
comical
in
the
extreme
the
two
men
stood
gazing
at
each
other
a
smile
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
solemn
wag
and
rippled
over
the
wide
expanse
of
his
homely
face
like
sunlight
overspreading
a
continent
and
mr
lincoln
was
convulsed
with
laughter
he
stayed
to
lunch
forgot
everything
he
knew
president
lincoln
while
entertaining
a
few
friends
is
said
to
have
related
the
following
anecdote
of
a
man
who
knew
too
much
during
the
administration
of
president
jackson
there
was
a
singular
young
gentleman
employed
in
the
public
postoffice
in
washington
his
name
was
g
he
was
from
tennessee
the
son
of
a
widow
a
neighbor
of
the
president
on
which
account
the
old
hero
had
a
kind
feeling
for
him
and
always
got
him
out
of
difficulties
with
some
of
the
higher
officials
to
whom
his
singular
interference
was
distasteful
among
other
things
it
is
said
of
him
that
while
employed
in
the
general
postoffice
on
one
occasion
he
had
to
copy
a
letter
to
major
h
a
high
official
in
answer
to
an
application
made
by
an
old
gentleman
in
virginia
or
pennsylvania
for
the
establishment
of
a
new
postoffice
the
writer
of
the
letter
said
the
application
could
not
be
granted
in
consequence
of
the
applicants
proximity
to
another
office
when
the
letter
came
into
gs
hand
to
copy
being
a
great
stickler
for
plainness
he
altered
proximity
to
nearness
to
major
h
observed
it
and
asked
g
why
he
altered
his
letter
why
replied
g
because
i
dont
think
the
man
would
understand
what
you
mean
by
proximity
well
said
major
h
try
him
put
in
the
proximity
again
in
a
few
days
a
letter
was
received
from
the
applicant
in
which
he
very
indignantly
said
that
his
father
had
fought
for
liberty
in
the
second
war
for
independence
and
he
should
like
to
have
the
name
of
the
scoundrel
who
brought
the
charge
of
proximity
or
anything
else
wrong
against
him
there
said
g
did
i
not
say
so
g
carried
his
improvements
so
far
that
mr
berry
the
postmastergeneral
said
to
him
i
dont
want
you
any
longer
you
know
too
much
poor
g
went
out
but
his
old
friend
got
him
another
place
this
time
gs
ideas
underwent
a
change
he
was
one
day
very
busy
writing
when
a
stranger
called
in
and
asked
him
where
the
patent
office
was
i
dont
know
said
g
can
you
tell
me
where
the
treasury
department
is
said
the
stranger
no
said
g
nor
the
presidents
house
no
the
stranger
finally
asked
him
if
he
knew
where
the
capitol
was
no
replied
g
do
you
live
in
washington
sir
yes
sir
said
g
good
lord
and
dont
you
know
where
the
patent
office
treasury
presidents
house
and
capitol
are
stranger
said
g
i
was
turned
out
of
the
postoffice
for
knowing
too
much
i
dont
mean
to
offend
in
that
way
again
i
am
paid
for
keeping
this
book
i
believe
i
know
that
much
but
if
you
find
me
knowing
anything
more
you
may
take
my
head
good
morning
said
the
stranger
he
loved
a
good
story
judge
breese
of
the
supreme
bench
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
american
jurists
and
a
man
of
great
personal
dignity
was
about
to
open
court
at
springfield
when
lincoln
called
out
in
his
hearty
way
hold
on
breese
dont
open
court
yet
heres
bob
blackwell
just
going
to
tell
a
story
the
judge
passed
on
without
replying
evidently
regarding
it
as
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
supreme
court
to
delay
proceedings
for
the
sake
of
a
story
heels
ran
away
with
them
in
an
argument
against
the
opposite
political
party
at
one
time
during
a
campaign
lincoln
said
my
opponent
uses
a
figurative
expression
to
the
effect
that
the
democrats
are
vulnerable
in
the
heel
but
they
are
sound
in
the
heart
and
head
the
first
branch
of
the
figurethat
is
the
democrats
are
vulnerable
in
the
heeli
admit
is
not
merely
figuratively
but
literally
true
who
that
looks
but
for
a
moment
at
their
hundreds
of
officials
scampering
away
with
the
public
money
to
texas
to
europe
and
to
every
spot
of
the
earth
where
a
villain
may
hope
to
find
refuge
from
justice
can
at
all
doubt
that
they
are
most
distressingly
affected
in
their
heels
with
a
species
of
running
itch
it
seems
that
this
malady
of
their
heels
operates
on
the
soundheaded
and
honesthearted
creatures
very
much
as
the
cork
leg
in
the
comic
song
did
on
its
owner
which
when
he
once
got
started
on
it
the
more
he
tried
to
stop
it
the
more
it
would
run
away
at
the
hazard
of
wearing
this
point
threadbare
i
will
relate
an
anecdote
the
situation
calls
to
my
mind
which
seems
to
be
too
strikingly
in
point
to
be
omitted
a
witty
irish
soldier
who
was
always
boasting
of
his
bravery
when
no
danger
was
near
but
who
invariably
retreated
without
orders
at
the
first
charge
of
the
engagement
being
asked
by
his
captain
why
he
did
so
replied
captain
i
have
as
brave
a
heart
as
julius
caesar
ever
had
but
somehow
or
other
whenever
danger
approaches
my
cowardly
legs
will
run
away
with
it
so
with
the
opposite
partythey
take
the
public
money
into
their
hands
for
the
most
laudable
purpose
that
wise
heads
and
honest
hearts
can
dictate
but
before
they
can
possibly
get
it
out
again
their
rascally
vulnerable
heels
will
run
away
with
them
wanted
to
burn
him
down
to
the
stump
preston
king
once
introduced
a
j
bleeker
to
the
president
and
the
latter
being
an
applicant
for
office
was
about
to
hand
mr
lincoln
his
vouchers
when
he
was
asked
to
read
them
bleeker
had
not
read
very
far
when
the
president
disconcerted
him
by
the
exclamation
stop
a
minute
you
remind
me
exactly
of
the
man
who
killed
the
dog
in
fact
you
are
just
like
him
in
what
respect
asked
bleeker
not
feeling
he
had
received
a
compliment
well
replied
the
president
this
man
had
made
up
his
mind
to
kill
his
dog
an
ugly
brute
and
proceeded
to
knock
out
his
brains
with
a
club
he
continued
striking
the
dog
after
the
latter
was
dead
until
a
friend
protested
exclaiming
you
neednt
strike
him
any
more
the
dog
is
dead
you
killed
him
at
the
first
blow
oh
yes
said
he
i
know
that
but
i
believe
in
punishment
after
death
so
i
see
you
do
bleeker
acknowledged
it
was
possible
to
overdo
a
good
thing
and
then
came
back
at
the
president
with
an
anecdote
of
a
good
priest
who
converted
an
indian
from
heathenism
to
christianity
the
only
difficulty
he
had
with
him
was
to
get
him
to
pray
for
his
enemies
this
indian
had
been
taught
to
overcome
and
destroy
all
his
friends
he
didnt
like
said
bleeker
but
the
priest
told
him
that
while
that
might
be
the
indian
method
it
was
not
the
doctrine
of
christianity
or
the
bible
saint
paul
distinctly
says
the
priest
told
him
if
thine
enemy
hunger
feed
him
if
he
thirst
give
him
drink
the
indian
shook
his
head
at
this
but
when
the
priest
added
for
in
so
doing
thou
shalt
heap
coals
of
fire
on
his
head
poor
lo
was
overcome
with
emotion
fell
on
his
knees
and
with
outstretched
hands
and
uplifted
eyes
invoked
all
sorts
of
blessings
on
the
heads
of
all
his
enemies
supplicating
for
pleasant
huntinggrounds
a
large
supply
of
squaws
lots
of
papooses
and
all
other
indian
comforts
finally
the
good
priest
interrupted
him
as
you
did
me
mr
president
exclaiming
stop
my
son
you
have
discharged
your
christian
duty
and
have
done
more
than
enough
oh
no
father
replied
the
indian
let
me
pray
i
want
to
burn
him
down
to
the
stump
had
a
kick
coming
during
the
war
one
of
the
northern
governors
who
was
able
earnest
and
untiring
in
aiding
the
administration
but
always
complaining
sent
dispatch
after
dispatch
to
the
war
office
protesting
against
the
methods
used
in
raising
troops
after
reading
all
his
papers
the
president
said
in
a
cheerful
and
reassuring
tone
to
the
adjutantgeneral
never
mind
never
mind
those
dispatches
dont
mean
anything
just
go
right
ahead
the
governor
is
like
a
boy
i
once
saw
at
a
launching
when
everything
was
ready
they
picked
out
a
boy
and
sent
him
under
the
ship
to
knock
away
the
trigger
and
let
her
go
at
the
critical
moment
everything
depended
on
the
boy
he
had
to
do
the
job
well
by
a
direct
vigorous
blow
and
then
lie
flat
and
keep
still
while
the
boat
slid
over
him
the
boy
did
everything
right
but
he
yelled
as
if
he
were
being
murdered
from
the
time
he
got
under
the
keel
until
he
got
out
i
thought
the
hide
was
all
scraped
off
his
back
but
he
wasnt
hurt
at
all
the
master
of
the
yard
told
me
that
this
boy
was
always
chosen
for
that
job
that
he
did
his
work
well
that
he
never
had
been
hurt
but
that
he
always
squealed
in
that
way
thats
just
the
way
with
governor
make
up
your
mind
that
he
is
not
hurt
and
that
he
is
doing
the
work
right
and
pay
no
attention
to
his
squealing
he
only
wants
to
make
you
understand
how
hard
his
task
is
and
that
he
is
on
hand
performing
it
the
case
of
betsy
ann
dougherty
many
requests
and
petitions
made
to
mr
lincoln
when
he
was
president
were
ludicrous
and
trifling
but
he
always
entered
into
them
with
that
humorloving
spirit
that
was
such
a
relief
from
the
grave
duties
of
his
great
office
once
a
party
of
southerners
called
on
him
in
behalf
of
one
betsy
ann
dougherty
the
spokesman
who
was
an
exgovernor
said
mr
president
betsy
ann
dougherty
is
a
good
woman
she
lived
in
my
county
and
did
my
washing
for
a
long
time
her
husband
went
off
and
joined
the
rebel
army
and
i
wish
you
would
give
her
a
protection
paper
the
solemnity
of
this
appeal
struck
mr
lincoln
as
uncommonly
ridiculous
the
two
men
looked
at
each
otherthe
governor
desperately
earnest
and
the
president
masking
his
humor
behind
the
gravest
exterior
at
last
mr
lincoln
asked
with
inimitable
gravity
was
betsy
ann
a
good
washerwoman
oh
yes
sir
she
was
indeed
was
your
betsy
ann
an
obliging
woman
yes
she
was
certainly
very
kind
responded
the
governor
soberly
could
she
do
other
things
than
wash
continued
mr
lincoln
with
the
same
portentous
gravity
oh
yes
she
was
very
kindvery
where
is
betsy
ann
she
is
now
in
new
york
and
wants
to
come
back
to
missouri
but
she
is
afraid
of
banishment
is
anybody
meddling
with
her
no
but
she
is
afraid
to
come
back
unless
you
will
give
her
a
protection
paper
thereupon
mr
lincoln
wrote
on
a
visiting
card
the
following
let
betsy
ann
dougherty
alone
as
long
as
she
behaves
herself
a
lincoln
he
handed
this
card
to
her
advocate
saying
give
this
to
betsy
ann
but
mr
president
couldnt
you
write
a
few
words
to
the
officers
that
would
insure
her
protection
no
said
mr
lincoln
officers
have
no
time
now
to
read
letters
tell
betsy
ann
to
put
a
string
in
this
card
and
hang
it
around
her
neck
when
the
officers
see
this
they
will
keep
their
hands
off
your
betsy
ann
had
to
wear
a
wooden
sword
captain
abe
lincoln
and
his
company
in
the
black
hawk
war
were
without
any
sort
of
military
knowledge
and
both
were
forced
to
acquire
such
knowledge
by
attempts
at
drilling
which
was
the
more
awkward
the
squad
or
the
commander
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
decide
in
one
of
lincolns
earliest
military
problems
was
involved
the
process
of
getting
his
company
endwise
through
a
gate
finally
he
shouted
this
company
is
dismissed
for
two
minutes
when
it
will
fall
in
again
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
lincoln
was
one
of
the
first
of
his
company
to
be
arraigned
for
unmilitary
conduct
contrary
to
the
rules
he
fired
a
gun
within
the
limits
and
had
his
sword
taken
from
him
the
next
infringement
of
rules
was
by
some
of
the
men
who
stole
a
quantity
of
liquor
drank
it
and
became
unfit
for
duty
straggling
out
of
the
ranks
the
next
day
and
not
getting
together
again
until
late
at
night
for
allowing
this
lawlessness
the
captain
was
condemned
to
wear
a
wooden
sword
for
two
days
these
were
merely
interesting
but
trivial
incidents
of
the
campaign
lincoln
was
from
the
very
first
popular
with
his
men
although
one
of
them
told
him
to
go
to
the
devil
abe
stirring
the
black
coals
under
the
caption
the
american
difficulty
punch

on
may
th
the
cartoon
reproduced
here
the
following
text
was
placed
beneath
the
illustration
president
abe
what
a
nice
white
house
this
would
be
if
it
were
not
for
the
blacks
it
was
the
idea
in
england
and
in
fact
in
all
the
countries
on
the
european
continent
that
the
war
of
the
rebellion
was
fought
to
secure
the
freedom
of
the
negro
slaves
such
was
not
the
case
the
freedom
of
the
slaves
was
one
of
the
necessary
consequences
of
the
civil
war
but
not
the
cause
of
that
bloody
four
years
conflict
the
war
was
the
result
of
the
secession
of
the
states
of
the
south
from
the
union
and
president
abes
main
aim
was
to
compel
the
seceding
states
to
resume
their
places
in
the
federal
union
of
states
the
blacks
did
not
bother
president
abe
in
the
least
as
he
knew
he
would
be
enabled
to
give
them
their
freedom
when
the
proper
time
came
he
had
the
project
of
freeing
them
in
his
mind
long
before
he
issued
his
emancipation
proclamation
the
delay
in
promulgating
that
document
being
due
to
the
fact
that
he
did
not
wish
to
estrange
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
patriots
of
the
border
states
who
were
fighting
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
and
not
for
the
freedom
of
the
negro
slaves
president
abe
had
patience
and
everything
came
out
all
right
in
the
end
getting
rid
of
an
elephant
charles
a
dana
who
was
assistant
secretary
of
war
under
mr
stanton
relates
the
following
a
certain
thompson
had
been
giving
the
government
considerable
trouble
dana
received
information
that
thompson
was
about
to
escape
to
liverpool
calling
upon
stanton
dana
was
referred
to
mr
lincoln
the
president
was
at
the
white
house
business
hours
were
over
lincoln
was
washing
his
hands
hallo
dana
said
he
as
i
opened
the
door
what
is
it
now
well
sir
i
said
here
is
the
provost
marshal
of
portland
who
reports
that
jacob
thompson
is
to
be
in
town
tonight
and
inquires
what
orders
we
have
to
give
what
does
stanton
say
he
asked
arrest
him
i
replied
well
he
continued
drawling
his
words
i
rather
guess
not
when
you
have
an
elephant
on
your
hands
and
he
wants
to
run
away
better
let
him
run
grotesque
yet
frightful
the
nearest
lincoln
ever
came
to
a
fight
was
when
he
was
in
the
vicinity
of
the
skirmish
at
kelloggs
grove
in
the
black
hawk
war
the
rangers
arrived
at
the
spot
after
the
engagement
and
helped
bury
the
five
men
who
were
killed
lincoln
told
noah
brooks
one
of
his
biographers
that
he
remembered
just
how
those
men
looked
as
we
rode
up
the
little
hill
where
their
camp
was
the
red
light
of
the
morning
sun
was
streaming
upon
them
as
they
lay
heads
toward
us
on
the
ground
and
every
man
had
a
round
red
spot
on
the
top
of
his
head
about
as
big
as
a
dollar
where
the
redskins
had
taken
his
scalp
it
was
frightful
but
it
was
grotesque
and
the
red
sunlight
seemed
to
paint
everything
all
over
lincoln
paused
as
if
recalling
the
vivid
picture
and
added
somewhat
irrelevantly
i
remember
that
one
man
had
on
buckskin
breeches
abe
was
no
dude
always
indifferent
in
matters
of
dress
lincoln
cut
but
small
figure
in
social
circles
even
in
the
earliest
days
of
illinois
his
trousers
were
too
short
his
hat
too
small
and
as
a
rule
the
buttons
on
the
back
of
his
coat
were
nearer
his
shoulder
blades
than
his
waist
no
man
was
richer
than
his
fellows
and
there
was
no
aristocracy
the
women
wore
linseywoolsey
of
home
manufacture
and
dyed
them
in
accordance
with
the
tastes
of
the
wearers
calico
was
rarely
seen
and
a
woman
wearing
a
dress
of
that
material
was
the
envy
of
her
sisters
there
being
no
shoemakers
the
women
wore
moccasins
and
the
men
made
their
own
boots
a
hunting
shirt
leggins
made
of
skins
buckskin
breeches
dyed
green
constituted
an
apparel
no
maiden
could
withstand
characteristic
of
lincoln
one
man
who
knew
lincoln
at
new
salem
says
the
first
time
he
saw
him
he
was
lying
on
a
trundlebed
covered
with
books
and
papers
and
rocking
a
cradle
with
his
foot
the
whole
scene
was
entirely
characteristiclincoln
reading
and
studying
and
at
the
same
time
helping
his
landlady
by
quieting
her
child
a
gentleman
who
knew
mr
lincoln
well
in
early
manhood
says
lincoln
at
this
period
had
nothing
but
plenty
of
friends
after
the
customary
handshaking
on
one
occasion
in
the
white
house
at
washington
several
gentlemen
came
forward
and
asked
the
president
for
his
autograph
one
of
them
gave
his
name
as
cruikshank
that
reminds
me
said
mr
lincoln
of
what
i
used
to
be
called
when
a
young
manlongshanks
plough
all
round
him
governor
blank
went
to
the
war
department
one
day
in
a
towering
rage
i
suppose
you
found
it
necessary
to
make
large
concessions
to
him
as
he
returned
from
you
perfectly
satisfied
suggested
a
friend
oh
no
the
president
replied
i
did
not
concede
anything
you
have
heard
how
that
illinois
farmer
got
rid
of
a
big
log
that
was
too
big
to
haul
out
too
knotty
to
split
and
too
wet
and
soggy
to
burn
well
now
said
he
in
response
to
the
inquiries
of
his
neighbors
one
sunday
as
to
how
he
got
rid
of
it
well
now
boys
if
you
wont
divulge
the
secret
ill
tell
you
how
i
got
rid
of
iti
ploughed
around
it
now
remarked
lincoln
in
conclusion
dont
tell
anybody
but
thats
the
way
i
got
rid
of
governor
blank
i
ploughed
all
round
him
but
it
took
me
three
mortal
hours
to
do
it
and
i
was
afraid
every
minute
hed
see
what
i
was
at
ive
lost
my
apple
during
a
public
reception
a
farmer
from
one
of
the
border
counties
of
virginia
told
the
president
that
the
union
soldiers
in
passing
his
farm
had
helped
themselves
not
only
to
hay
but
his
horse
and
he
hoped
the
president
would
urge
the
proper
officer
to
consider
his
claim
immediately
mr
lincoln
said
that
this
reminded
him
of
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
jack
chase
a
lumberman
on
the
illinois
a
steady
sober
man
and
the
best
raftsman
on
the
river
it
was
quite
a
trick
to
take
the
logs
over
the
rapids
but
he
was
skilful
with
a
raft
and
always
kept
her
straight
in
the
channel
finally
a
steamer
was
put
on
and
jack
was
made
captain
of
her
he
always
used
to
take
the
wheel
going
through
the
rapids
one
day
when
the
boat
was
plunging
and
wallowing
along
the
boiling
current
and
jacks
utmost
vigilance
was
being
exercised
to
keep
her
in
the
narrow
channel
a
boy
pulled
his
coattail
and
hailed
him
with
say
mister
captain
i
wish
you
would
just
stop
your
boat
a
minuteive
lost
my
apple
overboard
lost
his
certificate
of
character
mr
lincoln
prepared
his
first
inaugural
address
in
a
room
over
a
store
in
springfield
his
only
reference
works
were
henry
clays
great
compromise
speech
of
andrew
jacksons
proclamation
against
nullification
websters
great
reply
to
hayne
and
a
copy
of
the
constitution
when
mr
lincoln
started
for
washington
to
be
inaugurated
the
inaugural
address
was
placed
in
a
special
satchel
and
guarded
with
special
care
at
harrisburg
the
satchel
was
given
in
charge
of
robert
t
lincoln
who
accompanied
his
father
before
the
train
started
from
harrisburg
the
precious
satchel
was
missing
robert
thought
he
had
given
it
to
a
waiter
at
the
hotel
but
a
long
search
failed
to
reveal
the
missing
satchel
with
its
precious
document
lincoln
was
annoyed
angry
and
finally
in
despair
he
felt
certain
that
the
address
was
lost
beyond
recovery
and
as
it
only
lacked
ten
days
until
the
inauguration
he
had
no
time
to
prepare
another
he
had
not
even
preserved
the
notes
from
which
the
original
copy
had
been
written
mr
lincoln
went
to
ward
lamon
his
former
law
partner
then
one
of
his
bodyguards
and
informed
him
of
the
loss
in
the
following
words
lamon
i
guess
i
have
lost
my
certificate
of
moral
character
written
by
myself
bob
has
lost
my
gripsack
containing
my
inaugural
address
of
course
the
misfortune
reminded
him
of
a
story
i
feel
said
mr
lincoln
a
good
deal
as
the
old
member
of
the
methodist
church
did
when
he
lost
his
wife
at
the
camp
meeting
and
went
up
to
an
old
elder
of
the
church
and
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
him
whereabouts
in
hl
his
wife
was
in
fact
i
am
in
a
worse
fix
than
my
methodist
friend
for
if
it
were
only
a
wife
that
were
missing
mine
would
be
sure
to
bob
up
somewhere
the
clerk
at
the
hotel
told
mr
lincoln
that
he
would
probably
find
his
missing
satchel
in
the
baggageroom
arriving
there
mr
lincoln
saw
a
satchel
which
he
thought
was
his
and
it
was
passed
out
to
him
his
key
fitted
the
lock
but
alas
when
it
was
opened
the
satchel
contained
only
a
soiled
shirt
some
paper
collars
a
pack
of
cards
and
a
bottle
of
whisky
a
few
minutes
later
the
satchel
containing
the
inaugural
address
was
found
among
the
pile
of
baggage
the
recovery
of
the
address
also
reminded
mr
lincoln
of
a
story
which
is
thus
narrated
by
ward
lamon
in
his
recollections
of
abraham
lincoln
the
loss
of
the
address
and
the
search
for
it
was
the
subject
of
a
great
deal
of
amusement
mr
lincoln
said
many
funny
things
in
connection
with
the
incident
one
of
them
was
that
he
knew
a
fellow
once
who
had
saved
up
fifteen
hundred
dollars
and
had
placed
it
in
a
private
banking
establishment
the
bank
soon
failed
and
he
afterward
received
ten
per
cent
of
his
investment
he
then
took
his
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
deposited
it
in
a
savings
bank
where
he
was
sure
it
would
be
safe
in
a
short
time
this
bank
also
failed
and
he
received
at
the
final
settlement
ten
per
cent
on
the
amount
deposited
when
the
fifteen
dollars
was
paid
over
to
him
he
held
it
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
thoughtfully
then
he
said
now
darn
you
i
have
got
you
reduced
to
a
portable
shape
so
ill
put
you
in
my
pocket
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
mr
lincoln
took
his
address
from
the
bag
and
carefully
placed
it
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
vest
but
held
on
to
the
satchel
with
as
much
interest
as
if
it
still
contained
his
certificate
of
moral
character
note
presented
for
payment
the
great
english
funny
paper
london
punch
printed
this
cartoon
on
september
th
it
is
intended
to
convey
the
idea
that
lincoln
having
asserted
that
the
war
would
be
over
in
ninety
days
had
not
redeemed
his
word
the
text
under
the
cartoon
in
punch
was
mr
south
to
mr
north
your
ninetyday
promissory
note
isnt
taken
up
yet
sirree
the
tone
of
the
cartoon
is
decidedly
unfriendly
the
north
finally
took
up
the
note
but
the
south
had
to
pay
it
punch
was
not
pleased
with
the
result
but
mr
north
did
not
care
particularly
what
this
periodical
thought
about
it
the
united
states
since
then
has
been
prepared
to
take
up
all
of
its
obligations
when
due
but
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
at
the
time
this
cartoon
was
published
the
outlook
was
rather
dark
and
gloomy
lincoln
did
not
despair
however
but
although
business
was
in
rather
bad
shape
for
a
time
the
financial
skies
finally
cleared
business
was
resumed
at
the
old
stand
and
uncle
sams
credit
is
now
as
good
or
better
than
other
nations
cash
in
hand
dog
was
a
leetle
bit
ahead
lincoln
could
not
sympathize
with
those
union
generals
who
were
prone
to
indulge
in
highsounding
promises
but
whose
performances
did
not
by
any
means
come
up
to
their
predictions
as
to
what
they
would
do
if
they
ever
met
the
enemy
face
to
face
he
said
one
day
just
after
one
of
these
braggarts
had
been
soundly
thrashed
by
the
confederates
these
fellows
remind
me
of
the
fellow
who
owned
a
dog
which
so
he
said
just
hungered
and
thirsted
to
combat
and
eat
up
wolves
it
was
a
difficult
matter
so
the
owner
declared
to
keep
that
dog
from
devoting
the
entire
twentyfour
hours
of
each
day
to
the
destruction
of
his
enemies
he
just
hankered
to
get
at
them
one
day
a
party
of
this
dogowners
friends
thought
to
have
some
sport
these
friends
heartily
disliked
wolves
and
were
anxious
to
see
the
dog
eat
up
a
few
thousand
so
they
organized
a
hunting
party
and
invited
the
dogowner
and
the
dog
to
go
with
them
they
desired
to
be
personally
present
when
the
wolfkilling
was
in
progress
it
was
noticed
that
the
dogowner
was
not
overenthusiastic
in
the
matter
he
pleaded
a
business
engagement
but
as
he
was
the
most
notorious
and
torpid
of
the
town
loafers
and
wouldnt
have
recognized
a
business
engagement
had
he
met
it
face
to
face
his
excuse
was
treated
with
contempt
therefore
he
had
to
go
the
dog
however
was
glad
enough
to
go
and
so
the
party
started
out
wolves
were
in
plenty
and
soon
a
pack
was
discovered
but
when
the
wolfhound
saw
the
ferocious
animals
he
lost
heart
and
putting
his
tail
between
his
legs
endeavored
to
slink
away
at
lastafter
many
trialshe
was
enticed
into
the
small
growth
of
underbrush
where
the
wolves
had
secreted
themselves
and
yelps
of
terror
betrayed
the
fact
that
the
battle
was
on
away
flew
the
wolves
the
dog
among
them
the
hunting
party
following
on
horseback
the
wolves
seemed
frightened
and
the
dog
was
restored
to
public
favor
it
really
looked
as
if
he
had
the
savage
creatures
on
the
run
as
he
was
fighting
heroically
when
last
sighted
wolves
and
dog
soon
disappeared
and
it
was
not
until
the
party
arrived
at
a
distant
farmhouse
that
news
of
the
combatants
was
gleaned
have
you
seen
anything
of
a
wolfdog
and
a
pack
of
wolves
around
here
was
the
question
anxiously
put
to
the
male
occupant
of
the
house
who
stood
idly
leaning
upon
the
gate
yep
was
the
short
answer
how
were
they
going
purty
fast
what
was
their
position
when
you
saw
them
well
replied
the
farmer
in
a
most
exasperatingly
deliberate
way
the
dog
was
a
leetle
bit
ahead
now
gentlemen
concluded
the
president
thats
the
position
in
which
youll
find
most
of
these
bragging
generals
when
they
get
into
a
fight
with
the
enemy
thats
why
i
dont
like
military
orators
abes
fight
with
negroes
when
lincoln
was
nineteen
years
of
age
he
went
to
work
for
a
mr
gentry
and
in
company
with
gentrys
son
took
a
flatboat
load
of
provisions
to
new
orleans
at
a
plantation
six
miles
below
baton
rouge
while
the
boat
was
tied
up
to
the
shore
in
the
dead
hours
of
the
night
and
abe
and
allen
were
fast
asleep
in
the
bed
they
were
startled
by
footsteps
on
board
they
knew
instantly
that
it
was
a
gang
of
negroes
come
to
rob
and
perhaps
murder
them
allen
thinking
to
frighten
the
negroes
called
out
bring
guns
lincoln
and
shoot
them
abe
came
without
the
guns
but
fell
among
the
negroes
with
a
huge
bludgeon
and
belabored
them
most
cruelly
following
them
onto
the
bank
they
rushed
back
to
their
boat
and
hastily
put
out
into
the
stream
it
is
said
that
lincoln
received
a
scar
in
this
tussle
which
he
carried
with
him
to
his
grave
it
was
on
this
trip
that
he
saw
the
workings
of
slavery
for
the
first
time
the
sight
of
new
orleans
was
like
a
wonderful
panorama
to
his
eyes
for
never
before
had
he
seen
wealth
beauty
fashion
and
culture
he
returned
home
with
new
and
larger
ideas
and
stronger
opinions
of
right
and
justice
noise
like
a
turnip
every
man
has
his
own
peculiar
and
particular
way
of
getting
at
and
doing
things
said
president
lincoln
one
day
and
he
is
often
criticised
because
that
way
is
not
the
one
adopted
by
others
the
great
idea
is
to
accomplish
what
you
set
out
to
do
when
a
man
is
successful
in
whatever
he
attempts
he
has
many
imitators
and
the
methods
used
are
not
so
closely
scrutinized
although
no
man
who
is
of
good
intent
will
resort
to
mean
underhanded
scurvy
tricks
that
reminds
me
of
a
fellow
out
in
illinois
who
had
better
luck
in
getting
prairie
chickens
than
any
one
in
the
neighborhood
he
had
a
rusty
old
gun
no
other
man
dared
to
handle
he
never
seemed
to
exert
himself
being
listless
and
indifferent
when
out
after
game
but
he
always
brought
home
all
the
chickens
he
could
carry
while
some
of
the
others
with
their
finely
trained
dogs
and
latest
improved
fowlingpieces
came
home
alone
how
is
it
jake
inquired
one
sportsman
who
although
a
good
shot
and
knew
something
about
hunting
was
often
unfortunate
that
you
never
come
home
without
a
lot
of
birds
jake
grinned
half
closed
his
eyes
and
replied
oh
i
dont
know
that
theres
anything
queer
about
it
i
jes
go
ahead
an
git
em
yes
i
know
you
do
but
how
do
you
do
it
youll
tell
honest
jake
i
wont
say
a
word
hope
to
drop
dead
this
minute
never
say
nothing
if
i
tell
you
cross
my
heart
three
times
this
reassured
jake
who
put
his
mouth
close
to
the
ear
of
his
eager
questioner
and
said
in
a
whisper
all
you
got
to
do
is
jes
to
hide
in
a
fence
corner
an
make
a
noise
like
a
turnip
thatll
bring
the
chickens
every
time
warding
off
gods
vengeance
when
lincoln
was
a
candidate
for
reelection
to
the
illinois
legislature
in
a
meeting
was
advertised
to
be
held
in
the
courthouse
in
springfield
at
which
candidates
of
opposing
parties
were
to
speak
this
gave
men
of
spirit
and
capacity
a
fine
opportunity
to
show
the
stuff
of
which
they
were
made
george
forquer
was
one
of
the
most
prominent
citizens
he
had
been
a
whig
but
became
a
democratpossibly
for
the
reason
that
by
means
of
the
change
he
secured
the
position
of
government
land
register
from
president
andrew
jackson
he
had
the
largest
and
finest
house
in
the
city
and
there
was
a
new
and
striking
appendage
to
it
called
a
lightningrod
the
meeting
was
very
large
seven
whig
and
seven
democratic
candidates
spoke
lincoln
closed
the
discussion
a
kentuckian
joshua
f
speed
who
had
heard
henry
clay
and
other
distinguished
kentucky
orators
stood
near
lincoln
and
stated
afterward
that
he
never
heard
a
more
effective
speaker
the
crowd
seemed
to
be
swayed
by
him
as
he
pleased
what
occurred
during
the
closing
portion
of
this
meeting
must
be
given
in
full
from
judge
arnolds
book
forquer
although
not
a
candidate
asked
to
be
heard
for
the
democrats
in
reply
to
lincoln
he
was
a
good
speaker
and
well
known
throughout
the
county
his
special
task
that
day
was
to
attack
and
ridicule
the
young
countryman
from
salem
turning
to
lincoln
who
stood
within
a
few
feet
of
him
he
said
this
young
man
must
be
taken
down
and
i
am
truly
sorry
that
the
task
devolves
upon
me
he
then
proceeded
in
a
very
overbearing
way
and
with
an
assumption
of
great
superiority
to
attack
lincoln
and
his
speech
he
was
fluent
and
ready
with
the
rough
sarcasm
of
the
stump
and
he
went
on
to
ridicule
the
person
dress
and
arguments
of
lincoln
with
so
much
success
that
lincolns
friends
feared
that
he
would
be
embarrassed
and
overthrown
the
clarys
grove
boys
were
present
and
were
restrained
with
difficulty
from
getting
up
a
fight
in
behalf
of
their
favorite
lincoln
they
and
all
his
friends
feeling
that
the
attack
was
ungenerous
and
unmanly
lincoln
however
stood
calm
but
his
flashing
eye
and
pale
cheek
indicated
his
indignation
as
soon
as
forquer
had
closed
he
took
the
stand
and
first
answered
his
opponents
arguments
fully
and
triumphantly
so
impressive
were
his
words
and
manner
that
a
hearer
joshua
f
speed
believes
that
he
can
remember
to
this
day
and
repeat
some
of
the
expressions
among
other
things
he
said
the
gentleman
commenced
his
speech
by
saying
that
this
young
man
alluding
to
me
must
be
taken
down
i
am
not
so
young
in
years
as
i
am
in
the
tricks
and
the
trades
of
a
politician
but
said
he
pointing
to
forquer
live
long
or
die
young
i
would
rather
die
now
than
like
the
gentleman
change
my
politics
and
with
the
change
receive
an
office
worth
a
year
and
then
continued
he
feel
obliged
to
erect
a
lightningrod
over
my
house
to
protect
a
guilty
conscience
from
an
offended
god
jeff
davis
and
charles
the
first
jefferson
davis
insisted
on
being
recognized
by
his
official
title
as
commander
or
president
in
the
regular
negotiation
with
the
government
this
mr
lincoln
would
not
consent
to
mr
hunter
thereupon
referred
to
the
correspondence
between
king
charles
the
first
and
his
parliament
as
a
precedent
for
a
negotiation
between
a
constitutional
ruler
and
rebels
mr
lincolns
face
then
wore
that
indescribable
expression
which
generally
preceded
his
hardest
hits
and
he
remarked
upon
questions
of
history
i
must
refer
you
to
mr
seward
for
he
is
posted
in
such
things
and
i
dont
profess
to
be
but
my
only
distinct
recollection
of
the
matter
is
that
charles
lost
his
head
loved
soldiers
humor
lincoln
loved
anything
that
savored
of
wit
or
humor
among
the
soldiers
he
used
to
relate
two
stories
to
show
he
said
that
neither
death
nor
danger
could
quench
the
grim
humor
of
the
american
soldier
a
soldier
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
being
carried
to
the
rear
of
battle
with
both
legs
shot
off
who
seeing
a
piewoman
called
out
say
old
lady
are
them
pies
sewed
or
pegged
and
there
was
another
one
of
the
soldiers
at
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
whose
regiment
waiting
to
be
called
into
the
fight
was
taking
coffee
the
hero
of
the
story
put
to
his
lips
a
crockery
mug
which
he
had
carried
with
care
through
several
campaigns
a
stray
bullet
just
missing
the
tinkers
head
dashed
the
mug
into
fragments
and
left
only
the
handle
on
his
finger
turning
his
head
in
that
direction
he
scowled
johnny
you
cant
do
that
again
bad
time
for
a
barbecue
captain
t
w
s
kidd
of
springfield
was
the
crier
of
the
court
in
the
days
when
mr
lincoln
used
to
ride
the
circuit
i
was
younger
than
he
says
captain
kidd
but
he
had
a
sort
of
admiration
for
me
and
never
failed
to
get
me
into
his
stories
i
was
a
storyteller
myself
in
those
days
and
he
used
to
laugh
very
heartily
at
some
of
the
stories
i
told
him
now
and
then
he
got
me
into
a
good
deal
of
trouble
i
was
a
democrat
and
was
in
politics
more
or
less
a
good
many
of
our
democratic
voters
at
that
time
were
irishmen
they
came
to
illinois
in
the
days
of
the
old
canal
and
did
their
honest
share
in
making
that
piece
of
internal
improvement
an
accomplished
fact
one
time
mr
lincoln
told
the
story
of
one
of
those
important
young
fellowsnot
an
irishmanwho
lived
in
every
town
and
have
the
cares
of
state
on
their
shoulders
this
young
fellow

street

called
to

lincoln
told
that
story
in
one
of
his
political
speeches
and
when
the
laugh
was
over
he
said
now
gentlemen
i
know
that
story
is
true
for
tom
kidd
told
it
to
me
and
then
the
democrats
would
make
trouble
for
me
for
a
week
afterward
and
id
have
to
explain
hed
see
it
again
about
two
years
before
lincoln
was
nominated
for
the
presidency
he
went
to
bloomington
illinois
to
try
a
case
of
some
importance
his
opponentwho
afterward
reached
a
high
place
in
his
professionwas
a
young
man
of
ability
sensible
but
sensitive
and
one
to
whom
the
loss
of
a
case
was
a
great
blow
he
therefore
studied
hard
and
made
much
preparation
this
particular
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
late
at
night
and
although
anticipating
a
favorable
verdict
the
young
attorney
spent
a
sleepless
night
in
anxiety
early
next
morning
he
learned
to
his
great
chagrin
that
he
had
lost
the
case
lincoln
met
him
at
the
courthouse
some
time
after
the
jury
had
come
in
and
asked
him
what
had
become
of
his
case
with
lugubrious
countenance
and
in
a
melancholy
tone
the
young
man
replied
its
gone
to
hell
oh
well
replied
lincoln
then
you
will
see
it
again
call
another
witness
when
arguing
a
case
in
court
mr
lincoln
never
used
a
word
which
the
dullest
juryman
could
not
understand
rarely
if
ever
did
a
latin
term
creep
into
his
arguments
a
lawyer
quoting
a
legal
maxim
one
day
in
court
turned
to
lincoln
and
said
that
is
so
is
it
not
mr
lincoln
if
thats
latin
lincoln
replied
you
had
better
call
another
witness
a
contest
with
little
tad
mr
carpenter
the
artist
relates
the
following
incident
some
photographers
came
up
to
the
white
house
to
make
some
stereoscopic
studies
for
me
of
the
presidents
office
they
requested
a
dark
closet
in
which
to
develop
the
pictures
and
without
a
thought
that
i
was
infringing
upon
anybodys
rights
i
took
them
to
an
unoccupied
room
of
which
little
tad
had
taken
possession
a
few
days
before
and
with
the
aid
of
a
couple
of
servants
had
fitted
up
a
miniature
theater
with
stage
curtains
orchestra
stalls
parquette
and
all
knowing
that
the
use
required
would
interfere
with
none
of
his
arrangements
i
led
the
way
to
this
apartment
everything
went
on
well
and
one
or
two
pictures
had
been
taken
when
suddenly
there
was
an
uproar
the
operator
came
back
to
the
office
and
said
that
tad
had
taken
great
offense
at
the
occupation
of
his
room
without
his
consent
and
had
locked
the
door
refusing
all
admission
the
chemicals
had
been
taken
inside
and
there
was
no
way
of
getting
at
them
he
having
carried
off
the
key
in
the
midst
of
this
conversation
tad
burst
in
in
a
fearful
passion
he
laid
all
the
blame
upon
mesaid
that
i
had
no
right
to
use
his
room
and
the
men
should
not
go
in
even
to
get
their
things
he
had
locked
the
door
and
they
should
not
go
there
againthey
had
no
business
in
his
room
mr
lincoln
was
sitting
for
a
photograph
and
was
still
in
the
chair
he
said
very
mildly
tad
go
and
unlock
the
door
tad
went
off
muttering
into
his
mothers
room
refusing
to
obey
i
followed
him
into
the
passage
but
no
coaxing
would
pacify
him
upon
my
return
to
the
president
i
found
him
still
patiently
in
the
chair
from
which
he
had
not
risen
he
said
has
not
the
boy
opened
the
door
i
replied
that
we
could
do
nothing
with
himhe
had
gone
off
in
a
great
pet
mr
lincolns
lips
came
together
firmly
and
then
suddenly
rising
he
strode
across
the
passage
with
the
air
of
one
bent
on
punishment
and
disappeared
in
the
domestic
apartments
directly
he
returned
with
the
key
to
the
theater
which
he
unlocked
himself
tad
said
he
half
apologetically
is
a
peculiar
child
he
was
violently
excited
when
i
went
to
him
i
said
tad
do
you
know
that
you
are
making
your
father
a
great
deal
of
trouble
he
burst
into
tears
instantly
giving
me
up
the
key
reminded
him
of
a
little
story
when
lincolns
attention
was
called
to
the
fact
that
at
one
time
in
his
boyhood
he
had
spelled
the
name
of
the
deity
with
a
small
g
he
replied
that
reminds
me
of
a
little
story
it
came
about
that
a
lot
of
confederate
mail
was
captured
by
the
union
forces
and
while
it
was
not
exactly
the
proper
thing
to
do
some
of
our
soldiers
opened
several
letters
written
by
the
southerners
at
the
front
to
their
people
at
home
in
one
of
these
missives
the
writer
in
a
postscript
jotted
down
this
assertion
well
lick
the
yanks
termorrer
if
goddlemity
god
almighty
spares
our
lives
that
fellow
was
in
earnest
too
as
the
letter
was
written
the
day
before
the
second
battle
of
manassas
fetched
several
short
ones
the
first
time
i
ever
remember
seeing
abe
lincoln
is
the
testimony
of
one
of
his
neighbors
was
when
i
was
a
small
boy
and
had
gone
with
my
father
to
attend
some
kind
of
an
election
one
of
the
neighbors
james
larkins
was
there
larkins
was
a
great
hand
to
brag
on
anything
he
owned
this
time
it
was
his
horse
he
stepped
up
before
abe
who
was
in
a
crowd
and
commenced
talking
to
him
boasting
all
the
while
of
his
animal
i
have
got
the
best
horse
in
the
country
he
shouted
to
his
young
listener
i
ran
him
nine
miles
in
exactly
three
minutes
and
he
never
fetched
a
long
breath
i
presume
said
abe
rather
dryly
he
fetched
a
good
many
short
ones
though
lincoln
lugs
the
old
man

this
cartoon
over
the
title
of

and
the
old

of
the

secretary
of

welles
it
was
intended
to
demonstrate
that
the
head
of

navy
department
was
incompetent
to
manage
the
affairs
of
the
navy
also
that
the
navy
was
not

good
work
as
it
might

the

the
old

was
therefore
not
a
drag
or
a
weight
upon
president
lincoln
and
the
navy
was
not
so
far
behind
in
making
a
good
record
as
the
picture
would
have
the
people
of
the
world
believe
it
was
not
long
after
the

victory
that
the

was

a

told
some
friends
that
in
receiving
the

lincoln
laughed
heartily
over
the

of
clothing
and
remarked
to
mrs

nothing
else

out
of
this

while
talking
on
the
subject
one
day
with
friends
said
i
have
great
sympathy
for
these
men
because
of
their
temper
and
their
weakness
but
i
am
thankful
that
the
good
lord
has
given
to
the
vicious
ox
short
horns
for
if
their
physical
courage
were
equal
to
their
vicious
disposition

preacher
who
used
to
ride
a
church
circuit
as
mr
lincoln
and
others
did
the
court
circuit
did
not
like
lincoln
very
well
probably
because
mr

was
not
a

six

if

was
relating
to
the

how
a
friend
of
his
had
been
driven
away
from
new

as
a
unionist
and
how
on
his
expulsion
when
he
asked
to
see
the
writ
by
which
he
was
expelled
the
deputation
which
called
on
him
told
him
the
government
would
do
nothing
illegal
and
so
they
had
issued
no
illegal
writs
and
simply
meant
to
make
him
go
of
his
own
free
will
well
said
mr
lincoln
that
reminds
me
of
a
hotelkeeper
down
at
st
louis
who
boasted
that
he
never
had
a
death
in
his

whenever
a
guest
was

in

carried
him

sorely
mr

had
a
long
talk
with
his
friend
judge
gillespie
over
the
state
of
affairs
one
incident
of
the
conversation
is
thus
narrated
by
the
judge
when
i
retired
it
was
the
master
of
the
house
and
chosen
ruler
of
the
country
who
saw
me
to
my
room
joe
he
said
as
he
was
about
to
leave
me
i
am
reminded
and
i
suppose
you
will
never
forget
that
trial
down
in
montgomery
county
where
the
lawyer
associated
with
you
gave
away
the
whole
case
in
his
opening
speech
i
saw
you
signaling
to
him
but
you
couldnt
stop
him
now
thats
just
the
way
with
me
and
buchanan
he
is
giving
away
the
case
and
i
have
nothing
to
say
and
cant
stop
him
goodnight
posing
with
a
broomstick
mr
leonard
volk
the
artist
relates
that
being
in
springfield
when
lincolns
nomination
for
president
was
announced
he
called
upon
mr
lincoln
whom
he
found
looking
smiling
and
happy
i
exclaimed
i
am
the
first
man
from
chicago
i
believe
who
has
had
the
honor
of
congratulating
you
on
your
nomination
for
president
then
those
two
great
hands
took
both
of
mine
with
a
grasp
never
to
be
forgotten
and
while
shaking
i
said
now
that
you
will
doubtless
be
the
next
president
of
the
united
states
i
want
to
make
a
statue
of
you
and
shall
try
my
best
to
do
you
justice
said
he
i
dont
doubt
it
for
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
are
an
honest
man
and
with
that
greeting
i
thought
my
hands
in
a
fair
way
of
being
crushed
on
the
sunday
following
by
agreement
i
called
to
make
a
cast
of
mr
lincolns
hands
i
asked
him
to
hold
something
in
his
hands
and
told
him
a
stick
would
do
thereupon
he
went
to
the
woodshed
and
i
heard
the
saw
go
and
he
soon
returned
to
the
diningroom
whittling
off
the
end
of
a
piece
of
broom
handle
i
remarked
to
him
that
he
need
not
whittle
off
the
edges
oh
well
said
he
i
thought
i
would
like
to
have
it
nice
both
length
and
breadth
during
lincolns
first
and
only
term
in
congresshe
was
elected
in
he
formed
quite
a
cordial
friendship
with
stephen
a
douglas
a
member
of
the
united
states
senate
from
illinois
and
the
beaten
one
in
the
contest
as
to
who
should
secure
the
hand
of
miss
mary
todd
lincoln
was
the
winner
douglas
afterwards
beat
him
for
the
united
states
senate
but
lincoln
went
to
the
white
house
during
all
of
the
time
that
they
were
rivals
in
love
and
in
politics
they
remained
the
best
of
friends
personally
they
were
always
glad
to
see
each
other
and
were
frequently
together
the
disparity
in
their
size
was
always
the
more
noticeable
upon
such
occasions
and
they
well
deserved
their
nicknames
of
long
abe
and
the
little
giant
lincoln
was
the
tallest
man
in
the
national
house
of
representatives
and
douglas
the
shortest
and
perhaps
broadest
man
the
senate
and
when
they
appeared
on
the
streets
together
much
merriment
was
created
lincoln
when
joked
about
the
matter
replied
in
a
very
serious
tone
yes
thats
about
the
length
and
breadth
of
it
abe
recites
a
song
lincoln
couldnt
sing
and
he
also
lacked
the
faculty
of
musical
adaptation
he
had
a
liking
for
certain
ballads
and
songs
and
while
he
memorized
and
recited
their
lines
someone
else
did
the
singing
lincoln
often
recited
for
the
delectation
of
his
friends
the
following
the
authorship
of
which
is
unknown
the
first
factional
fight
in
old
ireland
they
say
was
all
on
account
of
st
patricks
birthday
it
was
somewhere
about
midnight
without
any
doubt
and
certain
it
is
it
made
a
great
rout
on
the
eighth
day
of
march
as
some
people
say
st
patrick
at
midnight
he
first
saw
the
day
while
others
assert
twas
the
ninth
he
was
born
twas
all
a
mistakebetween
midnight
and
morn
some
blamed
the
baby
some
blamed
the
clock
some
blamed
the
doctor
some
the
crowing
cock
with
all
these
close
questions
sure
no
one
could
know
whether
the
babe
was
too
fast
or
the
clock
was
too
slow
some
fought
for
the
eighth
for
the
ninth
some
would
die
he
who
wouldnt
see
right
would
have
a
black
eye
at
length
these
two
factions
so
positive
grew
they
each
had
a
birthday
and
pat
he
had
two
till
father
mulcahay
who
showed
them
their
sins
he
said
none
could
have
two
birthdays
but
as
twins
now
boys
dont
be
fighting
for
the
eight
or
the
nine
dont
quarrel
so
always
now
why
not
combine
combine
eight
with
nine
it
is
the
mark
let
that
be
the
birthday
amen
said
the
clerk
so
all
got
blind
drunk
which
completed
their
bliss
and
theyve
kept
up
the
practice
from
that
day
to
this
manage
to
keep
house
senator
john
sherman
of
ohio
introduced
his
brother
william
t
sherman
then
a
civilian
to
president
lincoln
in
march
sherman
had
offered
his
services
but
as
in
the
case
of
grant
they
had
been
refused
after
the
senator
had
transacted
his
business
with
the
president
he
said
mr
president
this
is
my
brother
colonel
sherman
who
is
just
up
from
louisiana
he
may
give
you
some
information
you
want
to
this
lincoln
replied
as
reported
by
senator
sherman
himself
ah
how
are
they
getting
along
down
there
sherman
answered
they
think
they
are
getting
along
swimmingly
they
are
prepared
for
war
to
which
lincoln
responded
oh
well
i
guess
well
manage
to
keep
the
house
tecump
whose
temper
was
not
the
mildest
broke
out
on
brother
john
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
white
house
cursed
the
politicians
roundly
and
wound
up
with
you
have
got
things
in
a
hl
of
a
fix
and
you
may
get
out
as
best
you
can
sherman
was
one
of
the
very
few
generals
who
gave
lincoln
little
or
no
worry
grant
tumbled
right
away
general
grant
told
this
story
about
lincoln
some
years
after
the
war
just
after
receiving
my
commission
as
lieutenantgeneral
the
president
called
me
aside
to
speak
to
me
privately
after
a
brief
reference
to
the
military
situation
he
said
he
thought
he
could
illustrate
what
he
wanted
to
say
by
a
story
said
he
at
one
time
there
was
a
great
war
among
the
animals
and
one
side
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
a
commander
who
had
sufficient
confidence
in
himself
finally
they
found
a
monkey
by
the
name
of
jocko
who
said
he
thought
he
could
command
their
army
if
his
tail
could
be
made
a
little
longer
so
they
got
more
tail
and
spliced
it
on
to
his
caudal
appendage
he
looked
at
it
admiringly
and
then
said
he
thought
he
ought
to
have
still
more
tail
this
was
added
and
again
he
called
for
more
the
splicing
process
was
repeated
many
times
until
they
had
coiled
jockos
tail
around
the
room
filling
all
the
space
still
he
called
for
more
tail
and
there
being
no
other
place
to
coil
it
they
began
wrapping
it
around
his
shoulders
he
continued
his
call
for
more
and
they
kept
on
winding
the
additional
tail
around
him
until
its
weight
broke
him
down
i
saw
the
point
and
rising
from
my
chair
replied
mr
president
i
will
not
call
for
any
more
assistance
unless
i
find
it
impossible
to
do
with
what
i
already
have
dont
kill
him
with
your
fist
ward
lamon
marshal
of
the
district
of
columbia
during
lincolns
time
in
washington
was
a
powerful
man
his
strength
was
phenomenal
and
a
blow
from
his
fist
was
like
unto
that
coming
from
the
business
end
of
a
sledge
lamon
tells
this
story
the
hero
of
which
is
not
mentioned
by
name
but
in
all
probability
his
identity
can
be
guessed
on
one
occasion
when
the
fears
of
the
loyal
element
of
the
city
washington
were
excited
to
feverheat
a
free
fight
near
the
old
national
theatre
occurred
about
eleven
oclock
one
night
an
officer
in
passing
the
place
observed
what
was
going
on
and
seeing
the
great
number
of
persons
engaged
he
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
command
the
peace
the
imperative
tone
of
his
voice
stopped
the
fighting
for
a
moment
but
the
leader
a
great
bully
roughly
pushed
back
the
officer
and
told
him
to
go
away
or
he
would
whip
him
the
officer
again
advanced
and
said
i
arrest
you
attempting
to
place
his
hand
on
the
mans
shoulder
when
the
bully
struck
a
fearful
blow
at
the
officers
face
this
was
parried
and
instantly
followed
by
a
blow
from
the
fist
of
the
officer
striking
the
fellow
under
the
chin
and
knocking
him
senseless
blood
issued
from
his
mouth
nose
and
ears
it
was
believed
that
the
mans
neck
was
broken
a
surgeon
was
called
who
pronounced
the
case
a
critical
one
and
the
wounded
man
was
hurried
away
on
a
litter
to
the
hospital
there
the
physicians
said
there
was
concussion
of
the
brain
and
that
the
man
would
die
all
the
medical
skill
that
the
officer
could
procure
was
employed
in
the
hope
of
saving
the
life
of
the
man
his
conscience
smote
him
for
having
as
he
believed
taken
the
life
of
a
fellowcreature
and
he
was
inconsolable
being
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
the
president
about
two
oclock
that
night
the
officer
went
to
the
white
house
woke
up
mr
lincoln
and
requested
him
to
come
into
his
office
where
he
told
him
his
story
mr
lincoln
listened
with
great
interest
until
the
narrative
was
completed
and
then
asked
a
few
questions
after
which
he
remarked
i
am
sorry
you
had
to
kill
the
man
but
these
are
times
of
war
and
a
great
many
men
deserve
killing
this
one
according
to
your
story
is
one
of
them
so
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
about
the
matter
i
will
stand
by
you
that
is
not
why
i
came
to
you
i
knew
i
did
my
duty
and
had
no
fears
of
your
disapproval
of
what
i
did
replied
the
officer
and
then
he
added
why
i
came
to
you
was
i
felt
great
grief
over
the
unfortunate
affair
and
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
it
mr
lincoln
then
said
with
a
smile
placing
his
hand
on
the
officer
shoulder
you
go
home
now
and
get
some
sleep
but
let
me
give
you
this
piece
of
advicehereafter
when
you
have
occasion
to
strike
a
man
dont
hit
him
with
your
fist
strike
him
with
a
club
a
crowbar
or
with
something
that
wont
kill
him
could
be
arbitrary
lincoln
could
be
arbitrary
when
occasion
required
this
is
the
letter
he
wrote
to
one
of
the
department
heads
you
must
make
a
job
of
it
and
provide
a
place
for
the
bearer
of
this
elias
wampole
make
a
job
of
it
with
the
collector
and
have
it
done
you
can
do
it
for
me
and
you
must
there
was
no
delay
in
taking
action
in
this
matter
mr
wampole
or
eli
as
he
was
thereafter
known
got
there
a
general
bustification
many
amusing
stories
are
told
of
president
lincoln
and
his
gloves
at
about
the
time
of
his
third
reception
he
had
on
a
tightfitting
pair
of
white
kids
which
he
had
with
difficulty
got
on
he
saw
approaching
in
the
distance
an
old
illinois
friend
named
simpson
whom
he
welcomed
with
a
genuine
sangamon
county
illeenoy
shake
which
resulted
in
bursting
his
white
kid
glove
with
an
audible
sound
then
raising
his
brawny
hand
up
before
him
looking
at
it
with
an
indescribable
expression
he
said
while
the
whole
procession
was
checked
witnessing
this
scene
well
my
old
friend
this
is
a
general
bustification
you
and
i
were
never
intended
to
wear
these
things
if
they
were
stronger
they
might
do
well
enough
to
keep
out
the
cold
but
they
are
a
failure
to
shake
hands
with
between
old
friends
like
us
stand
aside
captain
and
ill
see
you
shortly
simpson
stood
aside
and
after
the
unwelcome
ceremony
was
terminated
he
rejoined
his
old
illinois
friend
in
familiar
intercourse
making
quartermasters
h
c
whitney
wrote
in
i
was
in
washington
in
the
indian
service
for
a
few
days
before
august
and
i
merely
said
to
president
lincoln
one
day
everything
is
drifting
into
the
war
and
i
guess
you
will
have
to
put
me
in
the
army
the
president
looked
up
from
his
work
and
said
goodhumoredly
im
making
generals
now
in
a
few
days
i
will
be
making
quartermasters
and
then
ill
fix
you
no
postmasters
in
his
pocket
in
the
diary
of
a
public
man
appears
this
jocose
anecdote
mr
lincoln
walked
into
the
corridor
with
us
and
as
he
bade
us
goodby
and
thanked
blank
for
what
he
had
told
him
he
again
brightened
up
for
a
moment
and
asked
him
in
an
abrupt
kind
of
way
laying
his
hand
as
he
spoke
with
a
queer
but
not
uncivil
familiarity
on
his
shoulder
you
havent
such
a
thing
as
a
postmaster
in
your
pocket
have
you
blank
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
and
i
thought
a
little
in
alarm
as
if
he
suspected
a
sudden
attack
of
insanity
then
mr
lincoln
went
on
you
see
it
seems
to
me
kind
of
unnatural
that
you
shouldnt
have
at
least
a
postmaster
in
your
pocket
everybody
ive
seen
for
days
past
has
had
foreign
ministers
and
collectors
and
all
kinds
and
i
thought
you
couldnt
have
got
in
here
without
having
at
least
a
postmaster
get
into
your
pocket
he
skewed
the
line
when
a
surveyor
mr
lincoln
first
platted
the
town
of
petersburg
ill
some
twenty
or
thirty
years
afterward
the
propertyowners
along
one
of
the
outlying
streets
had
trouble
in
fixing
their
boundaries
they
consulted
the
official
plat
and
got
no
relief
a
committee
was
sent
to
springfield
to
consult
the
distinguished
surveyor
but
he
failed
to
recall
anything
that
would
give
them
aid
and
could
only
refer
them
to
the
record
the
dispute
therefore
went
into
the
courts
while
the
trial
was
pending
an
old
irishman
named
mcguire
who
had
worked
for
some
farmer
during
the
summer
returned
to
town
for
the
winter
the
case
being
mentioned
in
his
presence
he
promptly
said
i
can
tell
you
all
about
it
i
helped
carry
the
chain
when
abe
lincoln
laid
out
this
town
over
there
where
they
are
quarreling
about
the
lines
when
he
was
locating
the
street
he
straightened
up
from
his
instrument
and
said
if
i
run
that
street
right
through
it
will
cut
three
or
four
feet
off
the
end
of
s
house
its
all
hes
got
in
the
world
and
he
never
could
get
another
i
reckon
it
wont
hurt
anything
out
here
if
i
skew
the
line
a
little
and
miss
him
the
line
was
skewed
and
hence
the
trouble
and
more
testimony
furnished
as
to
lincolns
abounding
kindness
of
heart
that
would
not
willingly
harm
any
human
being
whereas
he
stole
nothing
one
of
the
most
celebrated
courtsmartial
during
the
war
was
that
of
franklin
w
smith
and
his
brother
charged
with
defrauding
the
government
these
men
bore
a
high
character
for
integrity
at
this
time
however
courtsmartial
were
seldom
invoked
for
any
other
purpose
than
to
convict
the
accused
and
the
smiths
shared
the
usual
fate
of
persons
whose
cases
were
submitted
to
such
arbitrament
they
were
kept
in
prison
their
papers
seized
their
business
destroyed
and
their
reputations
ruined
all
of
which
was
followed
by
a
conviction
the
finding
of
the
court
was
submitted
to
the
president
who
after
a
careful
investigation
disapproved
the
judgment
and
wrote
the
following
endorsement
upon
the
papers
whereas
franklin
w
smith
had
transactions
with
the
navy
department
to
the
amount
of
a
million
and
a
quarter
of
dollars
and
whereas
he
had
a
chance
to
steal
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
million
and
was
only
charged
with
stealing
twentytwo
hundred
dollars
and
the
question
now
is
about
his
stealing
one
hundred
i
dont
believe
he
stole
anything
at
all
therefore
the
record
and
the
findings
are
disapproved
declared
null
and
void
and
the
defendants
are
fully
discharged
not
like
the
popes
bull
president
lincoln
after
listening
to
the
arguments
and
appeals
of
a
committee
which
called
upon
him
at
the
white
house
not
long
before
the
emancipation
proclamation
was
issued
said
i
do
not
want
to
issue
a
document
that
the
whole
world
will
see
must
necessarily
be
inoperative
like
the
popes
bull
against
the
comet
could
he
tell
a
high
private
of
the
one
hundred
and
fortieth
infantry
regiment
pennsylvania
volunteers
wounded
at
chancellorsville
was
taken
to
washington
one
day
as
he
was
becoming
convalescent
a
whisper
ran
down
the
long
row
of
cots
that
the
president
was
in
the
building
and
would
soon
pass
by
instantly
every
boy
in
blue
who
was
able
arose
stood
erect
hands
to
the
side
ready
to
salute
his
commanderinchief
the
pennsylvanian
stood
six
feet
seven
inches
in
his
stockings
lincoln
was
six
feet
four
as
the
president
approached
this
giant
towering
above
him
he
stopped
in
amazement
and
casting
his
eyes
from
head
to
foot
and
from
foot
to
head
as
if
contemplating
the
immense
distance
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
he
stood
for
a
moment
speechless
at
length
extending
his
hand
he
exclaimed
hello
comrade
do
you
know
when
your
feet
get
cold
darned
uncomfortable
sitting
frank
leslies
illustrated
newspaper
of
march
nd
two
days
previous
to
the
inauguration
of
presidentelect
lincoln
contained
the
caricature
reproduced
here
it
was
intended
to
convey
the
idea
that
the
national
administration
would
thereafter
depend
upon
the
support
of
bayonets
to
uphold
it
and
the
text
underneath
the
picture
ran
as
follows
old
abe
oh
its
all
well
enough
to
say
that
i
must
support
the
dignity
of
my
high
office
by
forcebut
its
darned
uncomfortable
sitting
i
can
tell
yer
this
journal
was
not
entirely
friendly
to
the
new
chief
magistrate
but
it
could
not
see
into
the
future
many
of
the
leading
publications
of
the
east
among
them
some
of
those
which
condemned
slavery
and
were
opposed
to
secession
did
not
believe
lincoln
was
the
man
for
the
emergency
but
instead
of
doing
what
they
could
do
to
help
him
along
they
attacked
him
most
viciously
no
man
save
washington
was
more
brutally
lied
about
than
lincoln
but
he
bore
all
the
slurs
and
thrusts
not
to
mention
the
open
cruel
antagonism
of
those
who
should
have
been
his
warmest
friends
with
a
fortitude
and
patience
few
men
have
ever
shown
he
was
on
the
right
road
and
awaited
the
time
when
his
course
should
receive
the
approval
it
merited
whatshisname
got
there
general
james
b
fry
told
a
good
one
on
secretary
of
war
stanton
who
was
worsted
in
a
contention
with
the
president
several
brigadiergenerals
were
to
be
selected
and
lincoln
maintained
that
something
must
be
done
in
the
interest
of
the
dutch
many
complaints
had
come
from
prominent
men
born
in
the
fatherland
but
who
were
fighting
for
the
union
now
i
want
schimmelpfennig
given
one
of
those
brigadierships
stanton
was
stubborn
and
headstrong
as
usual
but
his
manner
and
tone
indicated
that
the
president
would
have
his
own
way
in
the
end
however
he
was
not
to
be
beaten
without
having
made
a
fight
but
mr
president
insisted
the
iron
war
secretary
it
may
be
that
this
mr
schimwhatshisnamehas
no
recommendations
showing
his
fitness
perhaps
he
cant
speak
english
that
doesnt
matter
a
bit
stanton
retorted
lincoln
he
may
be
deaf
and
dumb
for
all
i
know
but
whatever
language
he
speaks
if
any
we
can
furnish
troops
who
will
understand
what
he
says
that
name
of
his
will
make
up
for
any
differences
in
religion
politics
or
understanding
and
ill
take
the
risk
of
his
coming
out
all
right
then
slamming
his
great
hand
upon
the
secretarys
desk
he
said
schimmelfennig
must
be
appointed
and
he
was
there
and
then
a
really
great
general
do
you
know
general
a
queried
the
president
one
day
to
a
friend
who
had
dropped
in
at
the
white
house
certainly
but
you
are
not
wasting
any
time
thinking
about
him
are
you
was
the
rejoinder
you
wrong
him
responded
the
president
he
is
a
really
great
man
a
philosopher
how
do
you
make
that
out
he
isnt
worth
the
powder
and
ball
necessary
to
kill
him
so
i
have
heard
military
men
say
the
friend
remarked
he
is
a
mighty
thinker
the
president
returned
because
he
has
mastered
that
ancient
and
wise
admonition
know
thyself
he
has
formed
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
himself
knows
as
well
for
what
he
is
fitted
and
unfitted
as
any
man
living
without
doubt
he
is
a
remarkable
man
this
war
has
not
produced
another
like
him
how
is
it
you
are
so
highly
pleased
with
general
a
all
at
once
for
the
reason
replied
mr
lincoln
with
a
merry
twinkle
of
the
eye
greatly
to
my
relief
and
to
the
interests
of
the
country
he
has
resigned
the
country
should
express
its
gratitude
in
some
substantial
way
shrunk
up
north
there
was
no
member
of
the
cabinet
from
the
south
when
attorneygeneral
bates
handed
in
his
resignation
and
president
lincoln
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
making
a
selection
finally
titian
f
coffey
consented
to
fill
the
vacant
place
for
a
time
and
did
so
until
the
appointment
of
mr
speed
in
conversation
with
mr
coffey
the
president
quaintly
remarked
my
cabinet
has
shrunk
up
north
and
i
must
find
a
southern
man
i
suppose
if
the
twelve
apostles
were
to
be
chosen
nowadays
the
shrieks
of
locality
would
have
to
be
heeded
lincoln
adopted
the
suggestion
it
is
not
generally
known
that
president
lincoln
adopted
a
suggestion
made
by
secretary
of
the
treasury
salmon
p
chase
in
regard
to
the
emancipation
proclamation
and
incorporated
it
in
that
famous
document
after
the
president
had
read
it
to
the
members
of
the
cabinet
he
asked
if
he
had
omitted
anything
which
should
be
added
or
inserted
to
strengthen
it
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
closing
paragraph
of
the
proclamation
reads
in
this
way
and
upon
this
act
sincerely
believed
to
be
an
act
of
justice
warranted
by
the
constitution
i
invoke
the
considerate
judgment
of
mankind
and
the
gracious
favor
of
almighty
god
president
lincolns
draft
of
the
paper
ended
with
the
word
mankind
and
the
words
and
the
gracious
favor
of
almighty
god
were
those
suggested
by
secretary
chase
something
for
everyone
it
was
the
presidents
overweening
desire
to
accommodate
all
persons
who
came
to
him
soliciting
favors
but
the
opportunity
was
never
offered
until
an
untimely
and
unthinking
disease
which
possessed
many
of
the
characteristics
of
one
of
the
most
dreaded
maladies
confined
him
to
his
bed
at
the
white
house
the
rumor
spread
that
the
president
was
afflicted
with
this
disease
while
the
truth
was
that
it
was
merely
a
very
mild
attack
of
varioloid
the
officeseekers
didnt
know
the
facts
and
for
once
the
executive
mansion
was
clear
of
them
one
day
a
man
from
the
west
who
didnt
read
the
papers
but
wanted
the
postoffice
in
his
town
called
at
the
white
house
the
president
being
then
practically
a
well
man
saw
him
the
caller
was
engaged
in
a
voluble
endeavor
to
put
his
capabilities
in
the
most
favorable
light
when
the
president
interrupted
him
with
the
remark
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
make
the
interview
short
as
his
doctor
was
due
why
mr
president
are
you
sick
queried
the
visitor
oh
nothing
much
replied
mr
lincoln
but
the
physician
says
he
fears
the
worst
what
worst
may
i
ask
smallpox
was
the
answer
but
you
neednt
be
scared
im
only
in
the
first
stages
now
the
visitor
grabbed
his
hat
sprang
from
his
chair
and
without
a
word
bolted
for
the
door
dont
be
in
a
hurry
said
the
president
placidly
sit
down
and
talk
awhile
thank
you
sir
ill
call
again
shouted
the
westerner
as
he
disappeared
through
the
opening
in
the
wall
now
thats
the
way
with
people
the
president
said
when
relating
the
story
afterward
when
i
cant
give
them
what
they
want
theyre
dissatisfied
and
say
harsh
things
about
me
but
when
ive
something
to
give
to
everybody
they
scamper
off
too
many
pigs
for
the
teats
an
applicant
for
a
sutlership
in
the
army
relates
this
story
in
the
winter
of
after
serving
three
years
in
the
union
army
and
being
honorably
discharged
i
made
application
for
the
post
sutlership
at
point
lookout
my
father
being
interested
we
made
application
to
mr
stanton
the
secretary
of
war
we
obtained
an
audience
and
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
most
pompous
man
i
ever
met
as
i
entered
he
waved
his
hand
for
me
to
stop
at
a
given
distance
from
him
and
then
put
these
questions
viz
did
you
serve
three
years
in
the
army
i
did
sir
were
you
honorably
discharged
i
was
sir
let
me
see
your
discharge
i
gave
it
to
him
he
looked
it
over
then
said
were
you
ever
wounded
i
told
him
yes
at
the
battle
of
williamsburg
may
he
then
said
i
think
we
can
give
this
position
to
a
soldier
who
has
lost
an
arm
or
leg
he
being
more
deserving
and
he
then
said
i
looked
hearty
and
healthy
enough
to
serve
three
years
more
he
would
not
give
me
a
chance
to
argue
my
case
the
audience
was
at
an
end
he
waved
his
hand
to
me
i
was
then
dismissed
from
the
august
presence
of
the
honorable
secretary
of
war
my
father
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
hallway
who
saw
by
my
countenance
that
i
was
not
successful
i
said
to
my
father
let
us
go
over
to
mr
lincoln
he
may
give
us
more
satisfaction
he
said
it
would
do
me
no
good
but
we
went
over
mr
lincolns
reception
room
was
full
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
when
we
entered
my
turn
soon
came
lincoln
turned
to
my
father
and
said
now
gentlemen
be
pleased
to
be
as
quick
as
possible
with
your
business
as
it
is
growing
late
my
father
then
stepped
up
to
lincoln
and
introduced
me
to
him
lincoln
then
said
take
a
seat
gentlemen
and
state
your
business
as
quickly
as
possible
there
was
but
one
chair
by
lincoln
so
he
motioned
my
father
to
sit
while
i
stood
my
father
stated
the
business
to
him
as
stated
above
he
then
said
have
you
seen
mr
stanton
we
told
him
yes
that
he
had
refused
he
mr
lincoln
then
said
gentlemen
this
is
mr
stantons
business
i
cannot
interfere
with
him
he
attends
to
all
these
matters
and
i
am
sorry
i
cannot
help
you
he
saw
that
we
were
disappointed
and
did
his
best
to
revive
our
spirits
he
succeeded
well
with
my
father
who
was
a
lincoln
man
and
who
was
a
staunch
republican
mr
lincoln
then
said
now
gentlemen
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
i
have
thousands
of
applications
like
this
every
day
but
we
cannot
satisfy
all
for
this
reason
that
these
positions
are
like
office
seekersthere
are
too
many
pigs
for
the
teats
the
ladies
who
were
listening
to
the
conversation
placed
their
handkerchiefs
to
their
faces
and
turned
away
but
the
joke
of
old
abe
put
us
all
in
a
good
humor
we
then
left
the
presence
of
the
greatest
and
most
just
man
who
ever
lived
to
fill
the
presidential
chair
greeley
carries
lincoln
to
the
lunatic
asylum
no
sooner
was
abraham
lincoln
made
the
candidate
for
the
presidency
of
the
republican
party
in
than
the
opposition
began
to
lampoon
and
caricature
him
in
the
cartoon
here
reproduced
which
is
given
the
title
of
the
republican
party
going
to
the
right
house
lincoln
is
represented
as
entering
the
lunatic
asylum
riding
on
a
rail
carried
by
horace
greeley
the
great
abolitionist
lincoln
followed
by
his
fellowcranks
is
assuring
the
latter
that
the
millennium
is
going
to
begin
and
that
all
requests
will
be
granted
lincolns
followers
are
depicted
as
those
men
and
women
composing
the
free
love
element
those
who
want
religion
abolished
negroes
who
want
it
understood
that
the
white
man
has
no
rights
his
black
brother
is
bound
to
respect
women
suffragists
who
demand
that
men
be
made
subject
to
female
authority
tramps
who
insist
upon
free
lodginghouses
criminals
who
demand
the
right
to
steal
from
all
they
meet
and
toughs
who
want
the
police
forces
abolished
so
that
the
bhoys
can
run
wid
de
masheen
and
have
a
muss
whenever
they
feel
like
it
without
interference
by
the
authorities
the
last
time
he
saw
douglas
speaking
of
his
last
meeting
with
judge
douglas
mr
lincoln
said
one
day
douglas
came
rushing
in
and
said
he
had
just
got
a
telegraph
dispatch
from
some
friends
in
illinois
urging
him
to
come
out
and
help
set
things
right
in
egypt
and
that
he
would
go
or
stay
in
washington
just
where
i
thought
he
could
do
the
most
good
i
told
him
to
do
as
he
chose
but
that
probably
he
could
do
best
in
illinois
upon
that
he
shook
hands
with
me
and
hurried
away
to
catch
the
next
train
i
never
saw
him
again
hurt
his
legs
less
lincoln
was
one
of
the
attorneys
in
a
case
of
considerable
importance
court
being
held
in
a
very
small
and
dilapidated
schoolhouse
out
in
the
country
lincoln
was
compelled
to
stoop
very
much
in
order
to
enter
the
door
and
the
seats
were
so
low
that
he
doubled
up
his
legs
like
a
jackknife
lincoln
was
obliged
to
sit
upon
a
school
bench
and
just
in
front
of
him
was
another
making
the
distance
between
him
and
the
seat
in
front
of
him
very
narrow
and
uncomfortable
his
position
was
almost
unbearable
and
in
order
to
carry
out
his
preference
which
he
secured
as
often
as
possible
and
that
was
to
sit
as
near
to
the
jury
as
convenient
he
took
advantage
of
his
discomfort
and
finally
said
to
the
judge
on
the
bench
your
honor
with
your
permission
ill
sit
up
nearer
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
for
it
hurts
my
legs
less
to
rub
my
calves
against
the
bench
than
it
does
to
skin
my
shins
a
little
shy
or
grammar
when
mr
lincoln
had
prepared
his
brief
letter
accepting
the
presidential
nomination
he
took
it
to
dr
newton
bateman
the
state
superintendent
of
education
mr
schoolmaster
he
said
here
is
my
letter
of
acceptance
i
am
not
very
strong
on
grammar
and
i
wish
you
to
see
if
it
is
all
right
i
wouldnt
like
to
have
any
mistakes
in
it
the
doctor
took
the
letter
and
after
reading
it
said
there
is
only
one
change
i
should
suggest
mr
lincoln
you
have
written
it
shall
be
my
care
to
not
violate
or
disregard
it
in
any
part
you
should
have
written
not
to
violate
never
split
an
infinitive
is
the
rule
mr
lincoln
took
the
manuscript
regarding
it
a
moment
with
a
puzzled
air
so
you
think
i
better
put
those
two
little
fellows
end
to
end
do
you
he
said
as
he
made
the
change
his
first
satirical
writing
reuben
and
charles
grigsby
were
married
in
spencer
county
indiana
on
the
same
day
to
elizabeth
ray
and
matilda
hawkins
respectively
they
met
the
next
day
at
the
home
of
reuben
grigsby
sr
and
held
a
double
infare
to
which
most
of
the
county
was
invited
with
the
exception
of
the
lincolns
this
abraham
duly
resented
and
it
resulted
in
his
first
attempt
at
satirical
writing
which
he
called
the
chronicles
of
reuben
the
manuscript
was
lost
and
not
recovered
until
when
a
house
belonging
to
one
of
the
grigsbys
was
torn
down
in
the
loft
a
boy
found
a
roll
of
musty
old
papers
and
was
intently
reading
them
when
he
was
asked
what
he
was
doing
reading
a
portion
of
the
scriptures
that
havent
been
revealed
yet
was
the
response
this
was
lincolns
chronicles
which
is
herewith
given
the
chronicles
of
reuben
now
there
was
a
man
whose
name
was
reuben
and
the
same
was
very
great
in
substance
in
horses
and
cattle
and
swine
and
a
very
great
household
it
came
to
pass
when
the
sons
of
reuben
grew
up
that
they
were
desirous
of
taking
to
themselves
wives
and
being
too
well
known
as
to
honor
in
their
own
country
they
took
a
journey
into
a
far
country
and
there
procured
for
themselves
wives
it
came
to
pass
also
that
when
they
were
about
to
make
the
return
home
they
sent
a
messenger
before
them
to
bear
the
tidings
to
their
parents
these
inquiring
of
the
messenger
what
time
their
sons
and
wives
would
come
made
a
great
feast
and
called
all
their
kinsmen
and
neighbors
in
and
made
great
preparation
when
the
time
drew
nigh
they
sent
out
two
men
to
meet
the
grooms
and
their
brides
with
a
trumpet
to
welcome
them
and
to
accompany
them
when
they
came
near
unto
the
house
of
reuben
the
father
the
messenger
came
before
them
and
gave
a
shout
and
the
whole
multitude
ran
out
with
shouts
of
joy
and
music
playing
on
all
kinds
of
instruments
some
were
playing
on
harps
some
on
viols
and
some
blowing
on
rams
horns
some
also
were
casting
dust
and
ashes
toward
heaven
and
chief
among
them
all
was
josiah
blowing
his
bugle
and
making
sounds
so
great
the
neighboring
hills
and
valleys
echoed
with
the
resounding
acclamation
when
they
had
played
and
their
harps
had
sounded
till
the
grooms
and
brides
approached
the
gates
reuben
the
father
met
them
and
welcomed
them
to
his
house
the
wedding
feast
being
now
ready
they
were
all
invited
to
sit
down
and
eat
placing
the
bridegrooms
and
their
brides
at
each
end
of
the
table
waiters
were
then
appointed
to
serve
and
wait
on
the
guests
when
all
had
eaten
and
were
full
and
merry
they
went
out
again
and
played
and
sung
till
night
and
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
feasting
and
rejoicing
the
multitude
dispersed
each
going
to
his
own
home
the
family
then
took
seats
with
their
waiters
to
converse
while
preparations
were
being
made
in
two
upper
chambers
for
the
brides
and
grooms
this
being
done
the
waiters
took
the
two
brides
upstairs
placing
one
in
a
room
at
the
right
hand
of
the
stairs
and
the
other
on
the
left
the
waiters
came
down
and
nancy
the
mother
then
gave
directions
to
the
waiters
of
the
bridegrooms
and
they
took
them
upstairs
but
placed
them
in
the
wrong
rooms
the
waiters
then
all
came
downstairs
but
the
mother
being
fearful
of
a
mistake
made
inquiry
of
the
waiters
and
learning
the
true
facts
took
the
light
and
sprang
upstairs
it
came
to
pass
she
ran
to
one
of
the
rooms
and
exclaimed
o
lord
reuben
you
are
with
the
wrong
wife
the
young
men
both
alarmed
at
this
ran
out
with
such
violence
against
each
other
they
came
near
knocking
each
other
down
the
tumult
gave
evidence
to
those
below
that
the
mistake
was
certain
at
last
they
all
came
down
and
had
a
long
conversation
about
who
made
the
mistake
but
it
could
not
be
decided
so
ended
the
chapter
the
original
manuscript
of
the
chronicles
of
reuben
was
last
in
the
possession
of
redmond
grigsby
of
rockport
indiana
a
newspaper
which
had
obtained
a
copy
of
the
chronicles
sent
a
reporter
to
interview
elizabeth
grigsby
or
aunt
betsy
as
she
was
called
and
asked
her
about
the
famous
manuscript
and
the
mistake
made
at
the
double
wedding
yes
they
did
have
a
joke
on
us
said
aunt
betsy
they
said
my
man
got
into
the
wrong
room
and
charles
got
into
my
room
but
it
wasnt
so
lincoln
just
wrote
that
for
mischief
abe
and
my
man
often
laughed
about
that
likely
to
do
it
an
officer
having
had
some
trouble
with
general
sherman
being
very
angry
presented
himself
before
mr
lincoln
who
was
visiting
the
camp
and
said
mr
president
i
have
a
cause
of
grievance
this
morning
i
went
to
general
sherman
and
he
threatened
to
shoot
me
threatened
to
shoot
you
asked
mr
lincoln
well
in
a
stage
whisper
if
i
were
you
i
would
keep
away
from
him
if
he
threatens
to
shoot
i
would
not
trust
him
for
i
believe
he
would
do
it
the
enemy
are
ourn
early
in
the
presidential
campaign
of
president
lincoln
said
one
night
to
a
late
caller
at
the
white
house
we
have
met
the
enemy
and
they
are
ourn
i
think
the
cabal
of
obstructionists
am
busted
i
feel
certain
that
if
i
live
i
am
going
to
be
reelected
whether
i
deserve
to
be
or
not
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
but
on
the
score
even
of
remunerative
chances
for
speculative
service
i
now
am
inspired
with
the
hope
that
our
disturbed
country
further
requires
the
valuable
services
of
your
humble
servant
jordan
has
been
a
hard
road
to
travel
but
i
feel
now
that
notwithstanding
the
enemies
i
have
made
and
the
faults
i
have
committed
ill
be
dumped
on
the
right
side
of
that
stream
i
hope
however
that
i
may
never
have
another
four
years
of
such
anxiety
tribulation
and
abuse
my
only
ambition
is
and
has
been
to
put
down
the
rebellion
and
restore
peace
after
which
i
want
to
resign
my
office
go
abroad
take
some
rest
study
foreign
governments
see
something
of
foreign
life
and
in
my
old
age
die
in
peace
with
all
of
the
good
of
gods
creatures
andhere
i
am
an
old
acquaintance
of
the
president
visited
him
in
washington
lincoln
desired
to
give
him
a
place
thus
encouraged
the
visitor
who
was
an
honest
man
but
wholly
inexperienced
in
public
affairs
or
business
asked
for
a
high
office
superintendent
of
the
mint
the
president
was
aghast
and
said
good
gracious
why
didnt
he
ask
to
be
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
have
done
with
it
afterward
he
said
well
now
i
never
thought
mr
had
anything
more
than
average
ability
when
we
were
young
men
together
but
then
i
suppose
he
thought
the
same
thing
about
me
andhere
i
am
safe
as
long
as
they
were
good
at
the
celebrated
peace
conference
whereat
there
was
much
powwow
and
no
result
president
lincoln
in
response
to
certain
remarks
by
the
confederate
commissioners
commented
with
some
severity
upon
the
conduct
of
the
confederate
leaders
saying
they
had
plainly
forfeited
all
right
to
immunity
from
punishment
for
their
treason
being
positive
and
unequivocal
in
stating
his
views
concerning
individual
treason
his
words
were
of
ominous
import
there
was
a
pause
during
which
commissioner
hunter
regarded
the
speaker
with
a
steady
searching
look
at
length
carefully
measuring
his
words
mr
hunter
said
then
mr
president
if
we
understand
you
correctly
you
think
that
we
of
the
confederacy
have
committed
treason
are
traitors
to
your
government
have
forfeited
our
rights
and
are
proper
subjects
for
the
hangman
is
not
that
about
what
your
words
imply
yes
replied
president
lincoln
you
have
stated
the
proposition
better
than
i
did
that
is
about
the
size
of
it
another
pause
and
a
painful
one
succeeded
and
then
hunter
with
a
pleasant
smile
remarked
well
mr
lincoln
we
have
about
concluded
that
we
shall
not
be
hanged
as
long
as
you
are
presidentif
we
behave
ourselves
and
hunter
meant
what
he
said
smelt
no
royalty
in
our
carriage
on
one
occasion
in
going
to
meet
an
appointment
in
the
southern
part
of
the
sucker
statethat
section
of
illinois
called
egyptlincoln
with
other
friends
was
traveling
in
the
caboose
of
a
freight
train
when
the
freight
was
switched
off
the
main
track
to
allow
a
special
train
to
pass
lincolns
more
aristocratic
rival
stephen
a
douglas
was
being
conveyed
to
the
same
town
in
this
special
the
passing
train
was
decorated
with
banners
and
flags
and
carried
a
band
of
music
which
was
playing
hail
to
the
chief
as
the
train
whistled
past
lincoln
broke
out
in
a
fit
of
laughter
and
said
boys
the
gentleman
in
that
car
evidently
smelt
no
royalty
in
our
carriage
hell
a
mile
from
the
white
house
ward
lamon
told
this
story
of
president
lincoln
whom
he
found
one
day
in
a
particularly
gloomy
frame
of
mind
lamon
said
the
president
remarked
as
i
came
in
i
fear
i
have
made
senator
wade
of
ohio
my
enemy
for
life
how
i
asked
well
continued
the
president
wade
was
here
just
now
urging
me
to
dismiss
grant
and
in
response
to
something
he
said
i
remarked
senator
that
reminds
me
of
a
story
what
did
wade
say
i
inquired
of
the
president
he
said
in
a
petulant
way
the
president
responded
it
is
with
you
sir
all
story
story
you
are
the
father
of
every
military
blunder
that
has
been
made
during
the
war
you
are
on
your
road
to
hell
sir
with
this
government
by
your
obstinacy
and
you
are
not
a
mile
off
this
minute
what
did
you
say
then
i
goodnaturedly
said
to
him
the
president
replied
senator
that
is
just
about
from
here
to
the
capitol
is
it
not
he
was
very
angry
grabbed
up
his
hat
and
cane
and
went
away
his
glass
hack
president
lincoln
had
not
been
in
the
white
house
very
long
before
mrs
lincoln
became
seized
with
the
idea
that
a
fine
new
barouche
was
about
the
proper
thing
for
the
first
lady
in
the
land
the
president
did
not
care
particularly
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
and
told
his
wife
to
order
whatever
she
wanted
lincoln
forgot
all
about
the
new
vehicle
and
was
overcome
with
astonishment
one
afternoon
when
having
acceded
to
mrs
lincolns
desire
to
go
driving
he
found
a
beautiful
barouche
standing
in
front
of
the
door
of
the
white
house
his
wife
watched
him
with
an
amused
smile
but
the
only
remark
he
made
was
well
mary
thats
about
the
slickest
glass
hack
in
town
isnt
it
leave
him
kicking
lincoln
in
the
days
of
his
youth
was
often
unfaithful
to
his
quaker
traditions
on
the
day
of
election
in
word
came
to
him
that
one
radford
a
democratic
contractor
had
taken
possession
of
one
of
the
polling
places
with
his
workmen
and
was
preventing
the
whigs
from
voting
lincoln
started
off
at
a
gait
which
showed
his
interest
in
the
matter
in
hand
he
went
up
to
radford
and
persuaded
him
to
leave
the
polls
remarking
at
the
same
time
radford
youll
spoil
and
blow
if
you
live
much
longer
radfords
prudence
prevented
an
actual
collision
which
it
is
said
lincoln
regretted
he
told
his
friend
speed
he
wanted
radford
to
show
fight
so
that
he
might
knock
him
down
and
leave
him
kicking
who
commenced
this
fuss
president
lincoln
was
at
all
times
an
advocate
of
peace
provided
it
could
be
obtained
honorably
and
with
credit
to
the
united
states
as
to
the
cause
of
the
civil
war
which
side
of
mason
and
dixons
line
was
responsible
for
it
who
fired
the
first
shots
who
were
the
aggressors
etc
lincoln
did
not
seem
to
bother
about
he
wanted
to
preserve
the
union
above
all
things
slavery
he
was
assured
was
dead
but
he
thought
the
former
slaveholders
should
be
recompensed
to
illustrate
his
feelings
in
the
matter
he
told
this
story
some
of
the
supporters
of
the
union
cause
are
opposed
to
accommodate
or
yield
to
the
south
in
any
manner
or
way
because
the
confederates
began
the
war
were
determined
to
take
their
states
out
of
the
union
and
consequently
should
be
held
responsible
to
the
last
stage
for
whatever
may
come
in
the
future
now
this
reminds
me
of
a
good
story
i
heard
once
when
i
lived
in
illinois
a
vicious
bull
in
a
pasture
took
after
everybody
who
tried
to
cross
the
lot
and
one
day
a
neighbor
of
the
owner
was
the
victim
this
man
was
a
speedy
fellow
and
got
to
a
friendly
tree
ahead
of
the
bull
but
not
in
time
to
climb
the
tree
so
he
led
the
enraged
animal
a
merry
race
around
the
tree
finally
succeeding
in
seizing
the
bull
by
the
tail
the
bull
being
at
a
disadvantage
not
able
to
either
catch
the
man
or
release
his
tail
was
mad
enough
to
eat
nails
he
dug
up
the
earth
with
his
feet
scattered
gravel
all
around
bellowed
until
you
could
hear
him
for
two
miles
or
more
and
at
length
broke
into
a
dead
run
the
man
hanging
onto
his
tail
all
the
time
while
the
bull
much
out
of
temper
was
legging
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability
his
tormentor
still
clinging
to
the
tail
asked
darn
you
who
commenced
this
fuss
its
our
duty
to
settle
this
fuss
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
no
matter
who
commenced
it
thats
my
idea
of
it
abes
little
joke
when
general
w
t
sherman
november
th
severed
all
communication
with
the
north
and
started
for
savannah
with
his
magnificent
army
of
sixty
thousand
men
there
was
much
anxiety
for
a
month
as
to
his
whereabouts
president
lincoln
in
response
to
an
inquiry
said
i
know
what
hole
sherman
went
in
at
but
i
dont
know
what
hole
hell
come
out
at
colonel
mcclure
had
been
in
consultation
with
the
president
one
day
about
two
weeks
after
shermans
disappearance
and
in
this
connection
related
this
incident
i
was
leaving
the
room
and
just
as
i
reached
the
door
the
president
turned
around
and
with
a
merry
twinkling
of
the
eye
inquired
mcclure
wouldnt
you
like
to
hear
something
from
sherman
the
inquiry
electrified
me
at
the
instant
as
it
seemed
to
imply
that
lincoln
had
some
information
on
the
subject
i
immediately
answered
yes
most
of
all
i
should
like
to
hear
from
sherman
to
this
president
lincoln
answered
with
a
hearty
laugh
well
ill
be
hanged
if
i
wouldnt
myself
what
summer
thought
although
himself
a
most
polished
even
a
fastidious
gentleman
senator
sumner
never
allowed
lincolns
homely
ways
to
hide
his
great
qualities
he
gave
him
a
respect
and
esteem
at
the
start
which
others
accorded
only
after
experience
the
senator
was
most
tactful
too
in
his
dealings
with
mrs
lincoln
and
soon
had
a
firm
footing
in
the
household
that
he
was
proud
of
this
perhaps
a
little
boastful
there
is
no
doubt
lincoln
himself
appreciated
this
sumner
thinks
he
runs
me
he
said
with
an
amused
twinkle
one
day
a
useless
dog
when
hoods
army
had
been
scattered
into
fragments
president
lincoln
elated
by
the
defeat
of
what
had
so
long
been
a
menacing
force
on
the
borders
of
tennessee
was
reminded
by
its
collapse
of
the
fate
of
a
savage
dog
belonging
to
one
of
his
neighbors
in
the
frontier
settlements
in
which
he
lived
in
his
youth
the
dog
he
said
was
the
terror
of
the
neighborhood
and
its
owner
a
churlish
and
quarrelsome
fellow
took
pleasure
in
the
brutes
forcible
attitude
finally
all
other
means
having
failed
to
subdue
the
creature
a
man
loaded
a
lump
of
meat
with
a
charge
of
powder
to
which
was
attached
a
slow
fuse
this
was
dropped
where
the
dreaded
dog
would
find
it
and
the
animal
gulped
down
the
tempting
bait
there
was
a
dull
rumbling
a
muffled
explosion
and
fragments
of
the
dog
were
seen
flying
in
every
direction
the
grieved
owner
picking
up
the
shattered
remains
of
his
cruel
favorite
said
he
was
a
good
dog
but
as
a
dog
his
days
of
usefulness
are
over
hoods
army
was
a
good
army
said
lincoln
by
way
of
comment
and
we
were
all
afraid
of
it
but
as
an
army
its
usefulness
is
gone
origin
of
the
influence
story
judge
baldwin
of
california
being
in
washington
called
one
day
on
general
halleck
then
commanderinchief
of
the
union
forces
and
presuming
upon
a
familiar
acquaintance
in
california
a
few
years
since
solicited
a
pass
outside
of
our
lines
to
see
a
brother
in
virginia
not
thinking
that
he
would
meet
with
a
refusal
as
both
his
brother
and
himself
were
good
union
men
we
have
been
deceived
too
often
said
general
halleck
and
i
regret
i
cant
grant
it
judge
b
then
went
to
stanton
and
was
very
briefly
disposed
of
with
the
same
result
finally
he
obtained
an
interview
with
mr
lincoln
and
stated
his
case
have
you
applied
to
general
halleck
inquired
the
president
yes
and
met
with
a
flat
refusal
said
judge
b
then
you
must
see
stanton
continued
the
president
i
have
and
with
the
same
result
was
the
reply
well
then
said
mr
lincoln
with
a
smile
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
must
know
that
i
have
very
little
influence
with
this
administration
although
i
hope
to
have
more
with
the
next
felt
sorry
for
both
many
ladies
attended
the
famous
debates
between
lincoln
and
douglas
and
they
were
the
most
unprejudiced
listeners
i
can
recall
only
one
fact
of
the
debates
says
mrs
william
crotty
of
seneca
illinois
that
i
felt
so
sorry
for
lincoln
while
douglas
was
speaking
and
then
to
my
surprise
i
felt
so
sorry
for
douglas
when
lincoln
replied
the
disinterested
to
whom
it
was
an
intellectual
game
felt
the
power
and
charm
of
both
men
where
did
it
come
from
what
made
the
deepest
impression
upon
you
inquired
a
friend
one
day
when
you
stood
in
the
presence
of
the
falls
of
niagara
the
greatest
of
natural
wonders
the
thing
that
struck
me
most
forcibly
when
i
saw
the
falls
lincoln
responded
with
characteristic
deliberation
was
where
in
the
world
did
all
that
water
come
from
long
abe
four
years
longer
the
second
election
of
abraham
lincoln
to
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
was
the
reward
of
his
courage
and
genius
bestowed
upon
him
by
the
people
of
the
union
states
general
george
b
mcclellan
was
his
opponent
in
upon
the
platform
that
the
war
is
a
failure
and
carried
but
three
statesnew
jersey
delaware
and
kentucky
the
states
which
did
not
think
the

was
a
failure
were
those

all

popular
majority
over
mcclellan
who
never
did
much
toward
making
the

a
success

more
than
four
hundred
thousand
underneath
the
cartoon
reproduced
here
from
harpers
weekly
of
november
th
were
the
words
long
abraham
lincoln
a
little
longer
but
the
beloved
presidents
time
upon
earth
was
not
to
be
much
longer
as
he
was
assassinated
just
one
month
and
ten
days
after
his
second
inauguration
indeed
the
words
a
little
longer
printed
below
the
cartoon
were
strangely
prophetic
although
not
intended
to
be
such
the
people
of
the
united
states
had
learned
to
love
long
abe
their
affection
being
of
a
purely
personal
nature
in
the
main
no
other
chief
executive
was
regarded
as
so
sincerely
the
friend
of
the
great
mass
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
republic
as
lincoln
he
was
in
truth
one
of
the
common
people
having
been
born
among
them
and
lived
as
one
of
them
lincolns
great
height
made
him
an
easy
subject
for
the
cartoonist
and
they
used
it
in
his
favor
as
well
as
against
him
all
sickern
your
man
a
commissioner
to
the
hawaiian
islands
was
to
be
appointed
and
eight
applicants
had
filed
their
papers
when
a
delegation
from
the
south
appeared
at
the
white
house
on
behalf
of
a
ninth
not
only
was
their
man
fitso
the
delegation
urgedbut
was
also
in
bad
health
and
a
residence
in
that
balmy
climate
would
be
of
great
benefit
to
him
the
president
was
rather
impatient
that
day
and
before
the
members
of
the
delegation
had
fairly
started
in
suddenly
closed
the
interview
with
this
remark
gentlemen
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
there
are
eight
other
applicants
for
that
place
and
they
are
all
sickern
your
man
easier
to
empty
the
potomac
an
officer
of
low
volunteer
rank
persisted
in
telling
and
retelling
his
troubles
to
the
president
on
a
summer
afternoon
when
lincoln
was
tired
and
careworn
after
listening
patiently
he
finally
turned
upon
the
man
and
looking
wearily
out
upon
the
broad
potomac
in
the
distance
said
in
a
peremptory
tone
that
ended
the
interview
now
my
man
go
away
go
away
i
cannot
meddle
in
your
case
i
could
as
easily
bail
out
the
potomac
river
with
a
teaspoon
as
attend
to
all
the
details
of
the
army
he
wanted
a
steady
hand
when
the
emancipation
proclamation
was
taken
to
mr
lincoln
by
secretary
seward
for
the
presidents
signature
mr
lincoln
took
a
pen
dipped
it
in
the
ink
moved
his
hand
to
the
place
for
the
signature
held
it
a
moment
then
removed
his
hand
and
dropped
the
pen
after
a
little
hesitation
he
again
took
up
the
pen
and
went
through
the
same
movement
as
before
mr
lincoln
then
turned
to
mr
seward
and
said
i
have
been
shaking
hands
since
nine
oclock
this
morning
and
my
right
arm
is
almost
paralyzed
if
my
name
ever
goes
into
history
it
will
be
for
this
act
and
my
whole
soul
is
in
it
if
my
hand
trembles
when
i
sign
the
proclamation
all
who
examine
the
document
hereafter
will
say
he
hesitated
he
then
turned
to
the
table
took
up
the
pen
again
and
slowly
firmly
wrote
abraham
lincoln
with
which
the
whole
world
is
now
familiar
he
then
looked
up
smiled
and
said
that
will
do
lincoln
saw
stanton
about
it
mr
lovejoy
heading
a
committee
of
western
men
discussed
an
important
scheme
with
the
president
and
the
gentlemen
were
then
directed
to
explain
it
to
secretary
of
war
stanton
upon
presenting
themselves
to
the
secretary
and
showing
the
presidents
order
the
secretary
said
did
lincoln
give
you
an
order
of
that
kind
he
did
sir
then
he
is
a
dd
fool
said
the
angry
secretary
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
president
is
a
dd
fool
asked
lovejoy
in
amazement
yes
sir
if
he
gave
you
such
an
order
as
that
the
bewildered
illinoisan
betook
himself
at
once
to
the
president
and
related
the
result
of
the
conference
did
stanton
say
i
was
a
dd
fool
asked
lincoln
at
the
close
of
the
recital
he
did
sir
and
repeated
it
after
a
moments
pause
and
looking
up
the
president
said
if
stanton
said
i
was
a
dd
fool
then
i
must
be
one
for
he
is
nearly
always
right
and
generally
says
what
he
means
i
will
slip
over
and
see
him
mrs
lincolns
surprise
a
good
story
is
told
of
how
mrs
lincoln
made
a
little
surprise
for
her
husband
in
the
early
days
it
was
customary
for
lawyers
to
go
from
one
county
to
another
on
horseback
a
journey
which
often
required
several
weeks
on
returning
from
one
of
these
trips
late
one
night
mr
lincoln
dismounted
from
his
horse
at
the
familiar
corner
and
then
turned
to
go
into
the
house
but
stopped
a
perfectly
unknown
structure
was
before
him
surprised
and
thinking
there
must
be
some
mistake
he
went
across
the
way
and
knocked
at
a
neighbors
door
the
family
had
retired
and
so
called
out
whos
there
abe
lincoln
was
the
reply
i
am
looking
for
my
house
i
thought
it
was
across
the
way
but
when
i
went
away
a
few
weeks
ago
there
was
only
a
onestory
house
there
and
now
there
is
a
twostory
house
in
its
place
i
think
i
must
be
lost
the
neighbors
then
explained
that
mrs
lincoln
had
added
another
story
during
his
absence
and
mr
lincoln
laughed
and
went
to
his
remodeled
house
menace
to
the
government
the
persistence
of
officeseekers
nearly
drove
president
lincoln
wild
they
slipped
in
through
the
halfopened
doors
of
the
executive
mansion
they
dogged
his
steps
if
he
walked
they
edged
their
way
through
the
crowds
and
thrust
their
papers
in
his
hands
when
he
rode
and
taking
it
all
in
all
they
wellnigh
worried
him
to
death
he
once
said
that
if
the
government
passed
through
the
rebellion
without
dismemberment
there
was
the
strongest
danger
of
its
falling
a
prey
to
the
rapacity
of
the
officeseeking
class
this
human
struggle
and
scramble
for
office
for
a
way
to
live
without
work
will
finally
test
the
strength
of
our
institutions
were
the
words
he
used
troops
couldnt
fly
over
it
on
april
th
a
delegation
from
baltimore
appeared
at
the
white
house
and
begged
the
president
that
troops
for
washington
be
sent
around
and
not
through
baltimore
president
lincoln
replied
laughingly
if
i
grant
this
concession
you
will
be
back
tomorrow
asking
that
no
troops
be
marched
around
it
the
president
was
right
that
afternoon
and
again
on
sunday
and
monday
committees
sought
him
protesting
that
maryland
soil
should
not
be
polluted
by
the
feet
of
soldiers
marching
against
the
south
the
president
had
but
one
reply
we
must
have
troops
and
as
they
can
neither
crawl
under
maryland
nor
fly
over
it
they
must
come
across
it
pat
was
forninst
the
government
the
governorgeneral
of
canada
with
some
of
his
principal
officers
visited
president
lincoln
in
the
summer
of
they
had
been
very
troublesome
in
harboring
blockade
runners
and
they
were
said
to
have
carried
on
a
large
trade
from
their
ports
with
the
confederates
lincoln
treated
his
guests
with
great
courtesy
after
a
pleasant
interview
the
governor
alluding
to
the
coming
presidential
election
said
jokingly
but
with
a
grain
of
sarcasm
i
understand
mr
president
that
everybody
votes
in
this
country
if
we

until
november

remind
me
replied
the
president
of
a
countryman
of
yours
a
green
emigrant
from
ireland
pat
arrived
on
election
day
and
perhaps
was
as
eager
as
your
excellency
to
vote
and
to
vote
early
and
late
and
often
so
upon
landing
at
castle
garden
he
hastened
to
the
nearest
voting
place
and
as
he
approached
the
judge
who
received
the
ballots
inquired
who
do
you
want
to
vote
for
on
which
side
are
you
poor
pat
was
embarrassed
he
did
not
know
who
were
the
candidates
he
stopped
scratched
his
head
then
with
the
readiness
of
his
countrymen
he
said
i
am
forninst
the
government
anyhow
tell
me
if
your
honor
plase
which
is
the
rebellion
side
and
ill
tell
you
haw
i
want
to
vote
in
ould
ireland
i
was
always
on
the
rebellion
side
and
by
saint
patrick
ill
do
that
same
in
america
your
excellency
said
mr
lincoln
would
i
should
think
not
be
at
all
at
a
loss
on
which
side
to
vote
cant
spare
this
man
one
night
about
eleven
oclock
colonel
a
k
mcclure
whose
intimacy
with
president
lincoln
was
so
great
that
he
could
obtain
admittance
to
the
executive
mansion
at
any
and
all
hours
called
at
the
white
house
to
urge
mr
lincoln
to
remove
general
grant
from
command
after
listening
patiently
for
a
long
time
the
president
gathering
himself
up
in
his
chair
said
with
the
utmost
earnestness
i
cant
spare
this
man
he
fights
in
relating
the
particulars
of
this
interview
colonel
mcclure
said
that
was
all
he
said
but
i
knew
that
it
was
enough
and
that
grant
was
safe
in
lincolns
hands
against
his
countless
hosts
of
enemies
the
only
man
in
all
the
nation
who
had
the
power
to
save
grant
was
lincoln
and
he
had
decided
to
do
it
he
was
not
influenced
by
any
personal
partiality
for
grant
for
they
had
never
met
it
was
not
until
after
the
battle
of
shiloh
fought
on
the
th
and
th
of
april
that
lincoln
was
placed
in
a
position
to
exercise
a
controlling
influence
in
shaping
the
destiny
of
grant
the
first
reports
from
the
shiloh
battlefield
created
profound
alarm
throughout
the
entire
country
and
the
wildest
exaggerations
were
spread
in
a
floodtide
of
vituperation
against
grant
the
few
of
today
who
can
recall
the
inflamed
condition
of
public
sentiment
against
grant
caused
by
the
disastrous
first
days
battle
at
shiloh
will
remember
that
he
was
denounced
as
incompetent
for
his
command
by
the
public
journals
of
all
parties
in
the
north
and
with
almost
entire
unanimity
by
senators
and
congressmen
regardless
of
political
affinities
i
appealed
to
lincoln
for
his
own
sake
to
remove
grant
at
once
and
in
giving
my
reasons
for
it
i
simply
voiced
the
admittedly
overwhelming
protest
from
the
loyal
people
of
the
land
against
grants
continuance
in
command
i
did
not
forget
that
lincoln
was
the
one
man
who
never
allowed
himself
to
appear
as
wantonly
defying
public
sentiment
it
seemed
to
me
impossible
for
him
to
save
grant
without
taking
a
crushing
load
of
condemnation
upon
himself
but
lincoln
was
wiser
than
all
those
around
him
and
he
not
only
saved
grant
but
he
saved
him
by
such
wellconcerted
effort
that
he
soon
won
popular
applause
from
those
who
were
most
violent
in
demanding
grants
dismissal
his
teeth
chattered
during
the
lincolndouglas
joint
debates
of
the
latter
accused
lincoln
of
having
when
in
congress
voted
against
the
appropriation
for
supplies
to
be
sent
the
united
states
soldiers
in
mexico
in
reply
lincoln
said
this
is
a
perversion
of
the
facts
i
was
opposed
to
the
policy
of
the
administration
in
declaring
war
against
mexico
but
when
war
was
declared
i
never
failed
to
vote
for
the
support
of
any
proposition
looking
to
the
comfort
of
our
poor
fellows
who
were
maintaining
the
dignity
of
our
flag
in
a
war
that
i
thought
unnecessary
and
unjust
he
gradually
became
more
and
more
excited
his
voice
thrilled
and
his
whole
frame
shook
sitting
on
the
stand
was
o
b
ficklin
who
had
served
in
congress
with
lincoln
in
lincoln
reached
back
took
ficklin
by
the
coatcollar
back
of
his
neck
and
in
no
gentle
manner
lifted
him
from
his
seat
as
if
he
had
been
a
kitten
and
roared
fellowcitizens
here
is
ficklin
who
was
at
that
time
in
congress
with
me
and
he
knows
it
is
a
lie
he
shook
ficklin
until
his
teeth
chattered
fearing
he
would
shake
ficklins
head
off
ward
lamon
grasped
lincolns
hand
and
broke
his
grip
after
the
speaking
was
over
ficklin
who
had
warm
personal
friendship
with
him
said
lincoln
you
nearly
shook
all
the
democracy
out
of
me
today
aaron
got
his
commission
president
lincoln
was
censured
for
appointing
one
that
had
zealously
opposed
his
second
term
he
replied
well
i
suppose
judge
e
having
been
disappointed
before
did
behave
pretty
ugly
but
that
wouldnt
make
him
any
less
fit
for
the
place
and
i
think
i
have
scriptural
authority
for
appointing
him
you
remember
when
the
lord
was
on
mount
sinai
getting
out
a
commission
for
aaron
that
same
aaron
was
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
making
a
false
god
for
the
people
to
worship
yet
aaron
got
his
commission
you
know
lincoln
and
the
ministers
at
the
time
of
lincolns
nomination
at
chicago
mr
newton
bateman
superintendent
of
public
instruction
for
the
state
of
illinois
occupied
a
room
adjoining
and
opening
into
the
executive
chamber
at
springfield
frequently
this
door
was
open
during
mr
lincolns
receptions
and
throughout
the
seven
months
or
more
of
his
occupation
he
saw
him
nearly
every
day
often
when
mr
lincoln
was
tired
he
closed
the
door
against
all
intruders
and
called
mr
bateman
into
his
room
for
a
quiet
talk
on
one
of
these
occasions
mr
lincoln
took
up
a
book
containing
canvass
of
the
city
of
springfield
in
which
he
lived
showing
the
candidate
for
whom
each
citizen
had
declared
it
his
intention
to
vote
in
the
approaching
election
mr
lincolns
friends
had
doubtless
at
his
own
request
placed
the
result
of
the
canvass
in
his
hands
this
was
towards
the
close
of
october
and
only
a
few
days
before
election
calling
mr
bateman
to
a
seat
by
his
side
having
previously
locked
all
the
doors
he
said
let
us
look
over
this
book
i
wish
particularly
to
see
how
the
ministers
if
springfield
are
going
to
vote
the
leaves
were
turned
one
by
one
and
as
the
names
were
examined
mr
lincoln
frequently
asked
if
this
one
and
that
one
was
not
a
minister
or
an
elder
or
a
member
of
such
and
such
a
church
and
sadly
expressed
his
surprise
on
receiving
an
affirmative
answer
in
that
manner
he
went
through
the
book
and
then
he
closed
it
and
sat
silently
for
some
minutes
regarding
a
memorandum
in
pencil
which
lay
before
him
at
length
he
turned
to
mr
bateman
with
a
face
full
of
sadness
and
said
here
are
twentythree
ministers
of
different
denominations
and
all
of
them
are
against
me
but
three
and
here
are
a
great
many
prominent
members
of
churches
a
very
large
majority
are
against
me
mr
bateman
i
am
not
a
christiangod
knows
i
would
be
onebut
i
have
carefully
read
the
bible
and
i
do
not
so
understand
this
book
and
he
drew
forth
a
pocket
new
testament
these
men
well
know
he
continued
that
i
am
for
freedom
in
the
territories
freedom
everywhere
as
free
as
the
constitution
and
the
laws
will
permit
and
that
my
opponents
are
for
slavery
they
know
this
and
yet
with
this
book
in
their
hands
in
the
light
of
which
human
bondage
cannot
live
a
moment
they
are
going
to
vote
against
me
i
do
not
understand
it
at
all
here
mr
lincoln
pausedpaused
for
long
minutes
his
features
surcharged
with
emotion
then
he
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
receptionroom
in
the
effort
to
retain
or
regain
his
selfpossession
stopping
at
last
he
said
with
a
trembling
voice
and
cheeks
wet
with
tears
i
know
there
is
a
god
and
that
he
hates
injustice
and
slavery
i
see
the
storm
coming
and
i
know
that
his
hand
is
in
it
if
he
has
a
place
and
work
for
me
and
i
think
he
has
i
believe
i
am
ready
i
am
nothing
but
truth
is
everything
i
know
i
am
right
because
i
know
that
liberty
is
right
for
christ
teaches
it
and
christ
is
god
i
have
told
them
that
a
house
divided
against
itself
cannot
stand
and
christ
and
reason
say
the
same
and
they
will
find
it
so
douglas
doesnt
care
whether
slavery
is
voted
up
or
down
but
god
cares
and
humanity
cares
and
i
care
and
with
gods
help
i
shall
not
fail
i
may
not
see
the
end
but
it
will
come
and
i
shall
be
vindicated
and
these
men
will
find
they
have
not
read
their
bible
right
much
of
this
was
uttered
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
himself
and
with
a
sad
earnest
solemnity
of
manner
impossible
to
be
described
after
a
pause
he
resumed
doesnt
it
seem
strange
that
men
can
ignore
the
moral
aspect
of
this
contest
no
revelation
could
make
it
plainer
to
me
that
slavery
or
the
government
must
be
destroyed
the
future
would
be
something
awful
as
i
look
at
it
but
for
this
rock
on
which
i
stand
alluding
to
the
testament
which
he
still
held
in
his
hand
especially
with
the
knowledge
of
how
these
ministers
are
going
to
vote
it
seems
as
if
god
had
borne
with
this
thing
slavery
until
the
teachers
of
religion
have
come
to
defend
it
from
the
bible
and
to
claim
for
it
a
divine
character
and
sanction
and
now
the
cup
of
iniquity
is
full
and
the
vials
of
wrath
will
be
poured
out
everything
he
said
was
of
a
peculiarly
deep
tender
and
religious
tone
and
all
was
tinged
with
a
touching
melancholy
he
repeatedly
referred
to
his
conviction
that
the
day
of
wrath
was
at
hand
and
that
he
was
to
be
an
actor
in
the
terrible
struggle
which
would
issue
in
the
overthrow
of
slavery
although
he
might
not
live
to
see
the
end
after
further
reference
to
a
belief
in
the
divine
providence
and
the
fact
of
god
in
history
the
conversation
turned
upon
prayer
he
freely
stated
his
belief
in
the
duty
privilege
and
efficacy
of
prayer
and
intimated
in
no
unmistakable
terms
that
he
had
sought
in
that
way
divine
guidance
and
favor
the
effect
of
this
conversation
upon
the
mind
of
mr
bateman
a
christian
gentleman
whom
mr
lincoln
profoundly
respected
was
to
convince
him
that
mr
lincoln
had
in
a
quiet
way
found
a
path
to
the
christian
standpointthat
he
had
found
god
and
rested
on
the
eternal
truth
of
god
as
the
two
men
were
about
to
separate
mr
bateman
remarked
i
have
not
supposed
that
you
were
accustomed
to
think
so
much
upon
this
class
of
subjects
certainly
your
friends
generally
are
ignorant
of
the
sentiments
you
have
expressed
to
me
he
replied
quickly
i
know
they
are
but
i
think
more
on
these
subjects
than
upon
all
others
and
i
have
done
so
for
years
and
i
am
willing
you
should
know
it
hardtack
better
than
generals
secretary
of
war
stanton
told
the
president
the
following
story
which
greatly
amused
the
latter
as
he
was
especially
fond
of
a
joke
at
the
expense
of
some
high
military
or
civil
dignitary
stanton
had
little
or
no
sense
of
humor
when
secretary
stanton
was
making
a
trip
up
the
broad
river
in
north
carolina
in
a
tugboat
a
federal
picket
yelled
out
what
have
you
got
on
board
of
that
tug
the
severe
and
dignified
answer
was
the
secretary
of
war
and
majorgeneral
foster
instantly
the
picket
roared
back
weve
got
majorgenerals
enough
up
here
why
dont
you
bring
us
up
some
hardtack
got
the
preacher
a
story
told
by
a
cabinet
member
tended
to
show
how
accurately
lincoln
could
calculate
political
results
in
advancea
faculty
which
remained
with
him
all
his
life
a
friend
who
was
a
democrat
had
come
to
him
early
in
the
canvass
and
told
him
he
wanted
to
see
him
elected
but
did
not
like
to
vote
against
his
party
still
he
would
vote
for
him
if
the
contest
was
to
be
so
close
that
every
vote
was
needed
a
short
time
before
the
election
lincoln
said
to
him
i
have
got
the
preacher
and
i
dont
want
your
vote
big
joke
on
halleck
when
general
halleck
was
commanderinchief
of
the
union
forces
with
headquarters
at
washington
president
lincoln
unconsciously
played
a
big
practical
joke
upon
that
dignified
officer
the
president
had
spent
the
night
at
the
soldiers
home
and
the
next
morning
asked
captain
derickson
commanding
the
company
of
pennsylvania
soldiers
which
was
the
presidential
guard
at
the
white
house
and
the
homewherever
the
president
happened
to
beto
go
to
town
with
him
captain
derickson
told
the
story
in
a
most
entertaining
way
when
we
entered
the
city
mr
lincoln
said
he
would
call
at
general
hallecks
headquarters
and
get
what
news
had
been
received
from
the
army
during
the
night
i
informed
him
that
general
cullum
chief
aid
to
general
halleck
was
raised
in
meadville
and
that
i
knew
him
when
i
was
a
boy
he
replied
then
we
must
see
both
the
gentlemen
when
the
carriage
stopped
he
requested
me
to
remain
seated
and
said
he
would
bring
the
gentlemen
down
to
see
me
the
office
being
on
the
second
floor
in
a
short
time
the
president
came
down
followed
by
the
other
gentlemen
when
he
introduced
them
to
me
general
cullum
recognized
and
seemed
pleased
to
see
me
in
general
halleck
i
thought
i
discovered
a
kind
of
quizzical
look
as
much
as
to
say
isnt
this
rather
a
big
joke
to
ask
the
commanderinchief
of
the
army
down
to
the
street
to
be
introduced
to
a
country
captain
stories
better
than
doctors
a
gentleman
visiting
a
hospital
at
washington
heard
an
occupant
of
one
of
the
beds
laughing
and
talking
about
the
president
who
had
been
there
a
short
time
before
and
gladdened
the
wounded
with
some
of
his
stories
the
soldier
seemed
in
such
good
spirits
that
the
gentleman
inquired
you
must
be
very
slightly
wounded
yes
replied
the
brave
fellow
very
slightlyi
have
only
lost
one
leg
and
id
be
glad
enough
to
lose
the
other
if
i
could
hear
some
more
of
old
abes
stories
short
but
exciting
william
b
wilson
employed
in
the
telegraph
office
at
the
war
department
ran
over
to
the
white
house
one
day
to
summon
mr
lincoln
he
described
the
trip
back
to
the
war
department
in
this
manner
calling
one
of
his
two
younger
boys
to
join
him
we
then
started
from
the
white
house
between
stately
trees
along
a
gravel
path
which
led
to
the
rear
of
the
old
war
department
building
it
was
a
warm
day
and
mr
lincoln
wore
as
part
of
his
costume
a
faded
gray
linen
duster
which
hung
loosely
around
his
long
gaunt
frame
his
kindly
eye
was
beaming
with
good
nature
and
his
everthoughtful
brow
was
unruffled
we
had
barely
reached
the
gravel
walk
before
he
stooped
over
picked
up
a
round
smooth
pebble
and
shooting
it
off
his
thumb
challenged
us
to
a
game
of
followings
which
we
accepted
each
in
turn
tried
to
hit
the
outlying
stone
which
was
being
constantly
projected
onward
by
the
president
the
game
was
short
but
exciting
the
cheerfulness
of
childhood
the
ambition
of
young
manhood
and
the
gravity
of
the
statesman
were
all
injected
into
it
the
game
was
not
won
until
the
steps
of
the
war
department
were
reached
every
inch
of
progression
was
toughly
contested
and
when
the
president
was
declared
victor
it
was
only
by
a
hand
span
he
appeared
to
be
as
much
pleased
as
if
he
had
won
a
battle
mr
bull
didnt
get
his
cotton
because
of
the
blockade
by
the
union
fleets
of
the
southern
cotton
ports
england
was
deprived
of
her
supply
of
cotton
and
scores
of
thousands
of
british
operatives
were
thrown
out
of
employment
by
the
closing
of
the
cotton
mills
at
manchester
and
other
cities
in
great
britain
england
john
bull
felt
so
badly
about
this
that
the
british
wanted
to
go
to
war
on
account
of
it
but
when
the
united
states
eagle
ruffled
up
its
wings
the
english
thought
over
the
business
and
concluded
not
to
fight

contained
the
cartoon
we
reproduce
which
shows
john
bull
as
manifesting
much
anxiety
regarding
the
cotton
he
had
bought
from
the
southern
planters
but
which
the
latter
could
not
deliver

this
bit
of
dialogue
between

and

mr

confiding
creature
hi
want
my
cotton
bought
at
fipence
a
pound
mr
lincoln
dont
know
anything
about
it
my
dear
sir
your
friends

goodmorning
john

lincoln
has
a
big
fifteeninch
gun
at
his
side
the
black
muzzle
of
which
is
pressed
tightly
against
mr
bulls
waistcoat
the
president
to
all
appearances
has
the
best
of
the
argument
by
a
long
shot
anyhow
mr
bull
had
nothing
more
to
say
but
gave
the
cotton
matter
up
as
a
bad
piece
of
business
and
pocketed
the
loss
stick
to
american
principles
president
lincolns
first
conclusion
that
mason
and
slidell
should
be
released
was
the
real
ground
on
which
the
administration
submitted
we
must
stick
to
american
principles
concerning
the
rights
of
neutrals
it
was
to
many
as
secretary
of
the

chase
declared
it
was

john
provokin
us
to
fight
the
decision
raised
mr
lincoln
immeasurably
in
the
view
of
thoughtful
men
especially
in
england
used
rude
tact
general
john
c
fremont
with
headquarters
at
st
louis
astonished
the
country
by
issuing
a
proclamation
declaring
among
other
things
that
the
property
real
and
personal
of
all
the
persons
in
the
state
of
missouri
who
should
take
up
arms
against
the
united
states
or
who
should
be
directly
proved
to
have
taken
an
active
part
with
its
enemies
in
the
field
would
be
confiscated
to
public
use
and
their
slaves
if
they
had
any
declared
freemen
the
president
was
dismayed
he
modified
that
part
of
the
proclamation
referring
to
slaves
and
finally
replaced
fremont
with
general
hunter
mrs
fremont
daughter
of
senator
t
h
benton
her
husbands
real
chief
of
staff
flew
to
washington
and
sought
mr
lincoln
it
was
midnight
but
the
president
gave
her
an
audience
without
waiting
for
an
explanation
she
violently
charged
him
with
sending
an
enemy
to
missouri
to
look
into
fremonts
case
and
threatening
that
if
fremont
desired
to
he
could
set
up
a
government
for
himself
i
had
to
exercise
all
the
rude
tact
i
have
to
avoid
quarreling
with
her
said
mr
lincoln
afterwards
abe
on
a
woodpile
lincolns
attempt
to
make
a
lawyer
of
himself
under
adverse
and
unpromising
circumstanceshe
was
a
barefooted
farmhandexcited
comment
and
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
one
old
man
who
was
yet
alive
as
late
as
had
often
employed
lincoln
to
do
farm
work
for
him
and
was
surprised
to
find
him
one
day
sitting
barefoot
on
the
summit
of
a
woodpile
and
attentively
reading
a
book
this
being
an
unusual
thing
for
farmhands
in
that
early
day
to
do
said
the
old
man
when
relating
the
story
i
asked
him
what
he
was
reading
im
not
reading
he
answered
im
studying
studying
what
i
inquired
law
sir
was
the
emphatic
response
it
was
really
too
much
for
me
as
i
looked
at
him
sitting
there
proud
as
cicero
great
god
almighty
i
exclaimed
and
passed
on
lincoln
merely
laughed
and
resumed
his
studies
taking
down
a
dandy
in
a
political
campaign
lincoln
once
replied
to
colonel
richard
taylor
a
selfconceited
dandified
man
who
wore
a
gold
chain
and
ruffled
shirt
his
party
at
that
time
was
posing
as
the
hardworking
bone
and
sinew
of
the
land
while
the
whigs
were
stigmatized
as
aristocrats
ruffledshirt
gentry
taylor
making
a
sweeping
gesture
his
overcoat
became
torn
open
displaying
his
finery
lincoln
in
reply
said
laying
his
hand
on
his
jeansclad
breast
here
is
your
aristocrat
one
of
your
silkstocking
gentry
at
your
service
then
spreading
out
his
hands
bronzed
and
gaunt
with
toil
here
is
your
ragbasin
with
lilywhite
hands
yes
i
suppose
according
to
my
friend
taylor
i
am
a
bloated
aristocrat
when
old
abe
got
mad
soon
after
hostilities
broke
out
between
the
north
and
south
congress
appointed
a
committee
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
this
committee
beset
mr
lincoln
and
urged
all
sorts
of
measures
its
members
were
aggressive
and
patriotic
and
one
thing
they
determined
upon
was
that
the
army
of
the
potomac
should
move
but
it
was
not
until
march
that
they
became
convinced
that
anything
would
be
done
one
day
early
in
that
month
senator
chandler
of
michigan
a
member
of
the
committee
met
george
w
julian
he
was
in
high
glee
old
abe
is
mad
said
julian
and
the
war
will
now
go
on
wanted
to
borrow
the
army
during
one
of
the
periods
when
things
were
at
a
standstill
the
washington
authorities
being
unable
to
force
general
mcclellan
to
assume
an
aggressive
attitude
president
lincoln
went
to
the
generals
headquarters
to
have
a
talk
with
him
but
for
some
reason
he
was
unable
to
get
an
audience
mr
lincoln
returned
to
the
white
house
much
disturbed
at
his
failure
to
see
the
commander
of
the
union
forces
and
immediately
sent
for
two
general
officers
to
have
a
consultation
on
their
arrival
he
told
them
he
must
have
some
one
to
talk
to
about
the
situation
and
as
he
had
failed
to
see
general
mcclellan
he
wished
their
views
as
to
the
possibility
or
probability
of
commencing
active
operations
with
the
army
of
the
potomac
somethings
got
to
be
done
said
the
president
emphatically
and
done
right
away
or
the
bottom
will
fall
out
of
the
whole
thing
now
if
mcclellan
doesnt
want
to
use
the
army
for
awhile
id
like
to
borrow
it
from
him
and
see
if
i
cant
do
something
or
other
with
it
if
mcclellan
cant
fish
he
ought
at
least
to
be
cutting
bait
at
a
time
like
this
young
sucker
visitors
after
mr
lincolns
nomination
for
the
presidency
the
executive
chamber
a
large
fine
room
in
the
state
house
at
springfield
was
set
apart
for
him
where
he
met
the
public
until
after
his
election
as
illustrative
of
the
nature
of
many
of
his
calls
the
following
incident
was
related
by
mr
holland
an
eyewitness
mr
lincoln
being
in
conversation
with
a
gentleman
one
day
two
raw
plainlydressed
young
suckers
entered
the
room
and
bashfully
lingered
near
the
door
as
soon
as
he
observed
them
and
saw
their
embarrassment
he
rose
and
walked
to
them
saying
how
do
you
do
my
good
fellows
what
can
i
do
for
you
will
you
sit
down
the
spokesman
of
the
pair
the
shorter
of
the
two
declined
to
sit
and
explained
the
object
of
the
call
thus
he
had
had
a
talk
about
the
relative
height
of
mr
lincoln
and
his
companion
and
had
asserted
his
belief
that
they
were
of
exactly
the
same
height
he
had
come
in
to
verify
his
judgment
mr
lincoln
smiled
went
and
got
his
cane
and
placing
the
end
of
it
upon
the
wall
said
here
young
man
come
under
here
the
young
man
came
under
the
cane
as
mr
lincoln
held
it
and
when
it
was
perfectly
adjusted
to
his
height
mr
lincoln
said
now
come
out
and
hold
the
cane
this
he
did
while
mr
lincoln
stood
under
rubbing
his
head
back
and
forth
to
see
that
it
worked
easily
under
the
measurement
he
stepped
out
and
declared
to
the
sagacious
fellow
who
was
curiously
looking
on
that
he
had
guessed
with
remarkable
accuracythat
he
and
the
young
man
were
exactly
the
same
height
then
he
shook
hands
with
them
and
sent
them
on
their
way
mr
lincoln
would
just
as
soon
have
thought
of
cutting
off
his
right
hand
as
he
would
have
thought
of
turning
those
boys
away
with
the
impression
that
they
had
in
any
way
insulted
his
dignity
and
you
dont
wear
hoopskirts
an
ohio
senator
had
an
appointment
with
president
lincoln
at
six
oclock
and
as
he
entered
the
vestibule
of
the
white
house
his
attention
was
attracted
toward
a
poorly
clad
young
woman
who
was
violently
sobbing
he
asked
her
the
cause
of
her
distress
she
said
she
had
been
ordered
away
by
the
servants
after
vainly
waiting
many
hours
to
see
the
president
about
her
only
brother
who
had
been
condemned
to
death
her
story
was
this
she
and
her
brother
were
foreigners
and
orphans
they
had
been
in
this
country
several
years
her
brother
enlisted
in
the
army
but
through
bad
influences
was
induced
to
desert
he
was
captured
tried
and
sentenced
to
be
shotthe
old
story
the
poor
girl
had
obtained
the
signatures
of
some
persons
who
had
formerly
known
him
to
a
petition
for
a
pardon
and
alone
had
come
to
washington
to
lay
the
case
before
the
president
thronged
as
the
waitingrooms
always
were
she
had
passed
the
long
hours
of
two
days
trying
in
vain
to
get
an
audience
and
had
at
length
been
ordered
away
the
gentlemans
feelings
were
touched
he
said
to
her
that
he
had
come
to
see
the
president
but
did
not
know
as
he
should
succeed
he
told
her
however
to
follow
him
upstairs
and
he
would
see
what
could
be
done
for
her
just
before
reaching
the
door
mr
lincoln
came
out
and
meeting
his
friend
said
goodhumoredly
are
you
not
ahead
of
time
the
gentleman
showed
him
his
watch
with
the
hand
upon
the
hour
of
six
well
returned
mr
lincoln
i
have
been
so
busy
today
that
i
have
not
had
time
to
get
a
lunch
go
in
and
sit
down
i
will
be
back
directly
the
gentleman
made
the
young
woman
accompany
him
into
the
office
and
when
they
were
seated
said
to
her
now
my
good
girl
i
want
you
to
muster
all
the
courage
you
have
in
the
world
when
the
president
comes
back
he
will
sit
down
in
that
armchair
i
shall
get
up
to
speak
to
him
and
as
i
do
so
you
must
force
yourself
between
us
and
insist
upon
his
examination
of
your
papers
telling
him
it
is
a
case
of
life
and
death
and
admits
of
no
delay
these
instructions
were
carried
out
to
the
letter
mr
lincoln
was
at
first
somewhat
surprised
at
the
apparent
forwardness
of
the
young
woman
but
observing
her
distressed
appearance
he
ceased
conversation
with
his
friend
and
commenced
an
examination
of
the
document
she
had
placed
in
his
hands
glancing
from
it
to
the
face
of
the
petitioner
whose
tears
had
broken
forth
afresh
he
studied
its
expression
for
a
moment
and
then
his
eye
fell
upon
her
scanty
but
neat
dress
instantly
his
face
lighted
up
my
poor
girl
said
he
you
have
come
here
with
no
governor
or
senator
or
member
of
congress
to
plead
your
cause
you
seem
honest
and
truthful
and
you
dont
wear

i
will
be
whipped
but
i
will
pardon
your
brother

and
drilled

without
attracting

attention

one
night

relieved
the

seeing

appreciating

gladly

quarters
his
brother
objected
but

insisted
upon

the

laughed
but
declined
to
interfere

mr

once
said
in
a
speech
fellowcitizens
my
friend
mr
douglas
made
the
startling
announcement
today
that
the
whigs
are
all
dead
if
that
be
so
fellowcitizens
you
will
now
experience
the
novelty
of
hearing
a
speech
from
a
dead
man
and
i
suppose
you
might
properly
say
in
the
language
of
the
old
hymn
hark
from
the
tombs
a
doleful
sound
military
snails
not
speedy
president
lincolnas
he
himself
put
it
in
conversation
one
day
with
a
friendfairly
ached
for
his
generals
to
get
down
to
business
these
slow
generals
he
termed
snails
grant
sherman
and
sheridan
were
his
favorites
for
they
were
aggressive
they
did
not
wait
for
the
enemy
to
attack
too
many
of
the
others
were
lingerers
as
lincoln
called
them
they
were
magnificent
in
defense
and
stubborn
and
brave
but
their
names
figured
too
much
on
the
waiting
list
the
greatest
fault
lincoln
found
with
so
many
of
the
commanders
on
the
union
side
was
their
unwillingness
to
move
until
everything
was
exactly
to
their
liking
lincoln
could
not
understand
why
these
leaders
of
northern
armies
hesitated
outran
the
jackrabbit
when
the
union
forces
were
routed
in
the
first
battle
of
bull
run
there
were
many
civilians
present
who
had
gone
out
from
washington
to
witness
the
battle
among
the
number
were
several
congressmen
one
of
these
was
a
tall
longlegged
fellow
who
wore
a
longtailed
coat
and
a
high
plug
hat
when
the
retreat
began
this
congressman
was
in
the
lead
of
the
entire
crowd
fleeing
toward
washington
he
outran
all
the
rest
and
was
the
first
man
to
arrive
in
the
city
no
person
ever
made
such
good
use
of
long
legs
as
this
congressman
his
immense
stride
carried
him
yards
at
every
bound
he
went
over
ditches
and
gullies
at
a
single
leap
and
cleared
a
sixfoot
fence
with
a
foot
to
spare
as
he
went
over
the
fence
his
plug
hat
blew
off
but
he
did
not
pause
with
his
long
coattails
flying
in
the
wind
he
continued
straight
ahead
for
washington
many
of
those
behind
him
were
scared
almost
to
death
but
the
flying
congressman
was
such
a
comical
figure
that
they
had
to
laugh
in
spite
of
their
terror
mr
lincoln
enjoyed
the
description
of
how
this
congressman
led
the
race
from
bulls
run
and
laughed
at
it
heartily
i
never
knew
but
one
fellow
who
could
run
like
that
he
said
and
he
was
a
young
man
out
in
illinois
he
had
been
sparking
a
girl
much
against
the
wishes
of
her
father
in
fact
the
old
man
took
such
a
dislike
to
him
that
he
threatened
to
shoot
him
if
he
ever
caught
him
around
his
premises
again
one
evening
the
young
man
learned
that
the
girls
father
had
gone
to
the
city
and
he
ventured
out
to
the
house
he
was
sitting
in
the
parlor
with
his
arm
around
betsys
waist
when
he
suddenly
spied
the
old
man
coming
around
the
corner
of
the
house
with
a
shotgun
leaping
through
a
window
into
the
garden
he
started
down
a
path
at
the
top
of
his
speed
he
was
a
longlegged
fellow
and
could
run
like
greased
lightning
just
then
a
jackrabbit
jumped
up
in
the
path
in
front
of
him
in
about
two
leaps
he
overtook
the
rabbit
giving
it
a
kick
that
sent
it
high
in
the
air
he
exclaimed
git
out
of
the
road
gosh
dern
you
and
let
somebody
run
that
knows
how
i
reckon
said
mr
lincoln
that
the
longlegged
congressman
when
he
saw
the
rebel
muskets
must
have
felt
a
good
deal
like
that
young
fellow
did
when
he
saw
the
old
mans
shotgun
fooling
the
people
lincoln
was
a
strong
believer
in
the
virtue
of
dealing
honestly
with
the
people
if
you
once
forfeit
the
confidence
of
your
fellowcitizens
he
said
to
a
caller
at
the
white
house
you
can
never
regain
their
respect
and
esteem
it
is
true
that
you
may
fool
all
the
people
some
of
the
time
you
can
even
fool
some
of
the
people
all
the
time
but
you
cant
fool
all
of
the
people
all
the
time
abe
you
cant
play
that
on
me
the
night
presidentelect
lincoln
arrived
at
washington
one
man
was
observed
watching
lincoln
very
closely
as
he
walked
out
of
the
railroad
station
standing
a
little
to
one
side
the
man
looked
very
sharply
at
lincoln
and
as
the
latter
passed
seized
hold
of
his
hand
and
said
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
abe
you
cant
play
that
on
me
ward
lamon
and
the
others
with
lincoln
were
instantly
alarmed
and
would
have
struck
the
stranger
had
not
lincoln
hastily
said
dont
strike
him
it
is
washburne
dont
you
know
him
mr
seward
had
given
congressman
washburne
a
hint
of
the
time
the
train
would
arrive
and
he
had
the
right
to
be
at
the
station
when
the
train
steamed
in
but
his
indiscreet
manner
of
loudly
addressing
the
presidentelect
might
have
led
to
serious
consequences
to
the
latter
his
broad
stories
mrs
rose
linder
wilkinson
who
often
accompanied
her
father
judge
linder
in
the
days
when
he
rode
circuit
with
mr
lincoln
tells
the
following
story
at
night
as
a
rule
the
lawyers
spent
awhile
in
the
parlor
and
permitted
the
women
who
happened
to
be
along
to
sit
with
them
but
after
half
an
hour
or
so
we
would
notice
it
was
time
for
us
to
leave
them
i
remember
traveling
the
circuit
one
season
when
the
young
wife
of
one
of
the
lawyers
was
with
him
the
place
was
so
crowded
that
she
and
i
were
made
to
sleep
together
when
the
time
came
for
banishing
us
from
the
parlor
we
went
up
to
our
room
and
sat
there
till
bedtime
listening
to
the
roars
that
followed
each
ether
swiftly
while
those
lawyers
downstairs
told
stories
and
laughed
till
the
rafters
rang
in
the
morning
mr
lincoln
said
to
me
rose
did
we
disturb
your
sleep
last
night
i
answered
no
i
had
no
sleepwhich
was
not
entirely
true
but
the
retort
amused
him
then
the
young
lawyers
wife
complained
to
him
that
we
were
not
fairly
used
we
came
along
with
them
young
women
and
when
they
were
having
the
best
time
we
were
sent
away
like
children
to
go
to
bed
in
the
dark
but
madame
said
mr
lincoln
you
would
not
enjoy
the
things
we
laugh
at
and
then
he
entered
into
a
discussion
on
what
have
been
termed
his
broad
stories
he
deplored
the
fact
that
men
seemed
to
remember
them
longer
and
with
less
effort
than
any
others
my
father
said
but
lincoln
i
dont
remember
the
broad
part
of
your
stories
so
much
as
i
do
the
moral
that
is
in
them
and
it
was
a
thing
in
which
they
were
all
agreed
sorry
for
the
horses
when
president
lincoln
heard
of
the
confederate
raid
at
fairfax
in
which
a
brigadiergeneral
and
a
number
of
valuable
horses
were
captured
he
gravely
observed
well
i
am
sorry
for
the
horses
sorry
for
the
horses
mr
president
exclaimed
the
secretary
of
war
raising
his
spectacles
and
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
in
astonishment
yes
replied
mr
lincoln
i
can
make
a
brigadiergeneral
in
five
minutes
but
it
is
not
easy
to
replace
a
hundred
and
ten
horses
mild
rebuke
to
a
doctor
dr
jerome
walker
of
brooklyn
told
how
mr
lincoln
once
administered
to
him
a
mild
rebuke
the
doctor
was
showing
mr
lincoln
through
the
hospital
at
city
point
finally
after
visiting
the
wards
occupied
by
our
invalid
and
convalescing
soldiers
said
dr
walker
we
came
to
three
wards
occupied
by
sick
and
wounded
southern
prisoners
with
a
feeling
of
patriotic
duty
i
said
mr
president
you
wont
want
to
go
in
there
they
are
only
rebels
i
will
never
forget
how
he
stopped
and
gently
laid
his
large
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
quietly
answered
you
mean
confederates
and
i
have
meant
confederates
ever
since
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
after
the
presidents
remark
but
to
go
with
him
through
these
three
wards
and
i
could
not
see
but
that
he
was
just
as
kind
his
handshakings
just
as
hearty
his
interest
just
as
real
for
the
welfare
of
the
men
as
when
he
was
among
our
own
soldiers
cold
molasses
was
swifter
old
pap
as
the
soldiers
called
general
george
h
thomas
was
aggravatingly
slow
at
a
time
when
the
president
wanted
him
to
get
a
move
on
in
fact
the
gallant
rock
of
chickamauga
was
evidently
entered
in
a
snailrace
some
of
my
generals
are
so
slow
regretfully
remarked
lincoln
one
day
that
molasses
in
the
coldest
days
of
winter
is
a
race
horse
compared
to
them
theyre
brave
enough
but
somehow
or
other
they
get
fastened
in
a
fence
corner
and
cant
figure
their
way
out
lincoln
calls
medill
a
coward
joseph
medill
for
many
years
editor
of
the
chicago
tribune
not
long
before
his
death
told
the
following
story
regarding
the
talking
to
president
lincoln
gave
himself
and
two
other
chicago
gentlemen
who
went
to
washington
to
see
about
reducing
chicagos
quota
of
troops
after
the
call
for
extra
men
was
made
by
the
president
in
in
when
the
call
for
extra
troops
came
chicago
revolted
she
had
already
sent
troops
up
to
that
time
and
was
drained
when
the
call
came
there
were
no
young
men
to
go
and
no
aliens
except
what
were
bought
the
citizens
held
a
mass
meeting
and
appointed
three
persons
of
whom
i
was
one
to
go
to
washington
and
ask
stanton
to
give
cook
county
a
new
enrollment
on
reaching
washington
we
went
to
stanton
with
our
statement
he
refused
entirely
to
give
us
the
desired
aid
then
we
went
to
lincoln
i
cannot
do
it
he
said
but
i
will
go
with
you
to
the
war
department
and
stanton
and
i
will
hear
both
sides
so
we
all
went
over
to
the
war
department
together
stanton
and
general
frye
were
there
and
they
of
course
contended
that
the
quota
should
not
be
changed
the
argument
went
on
for
some
time
and
was
finally
referred
to
lincoln
who
had
been
sitting
silently
listening
i
shall
never
forget
how
he
suddenly
lifted
his
head
and
turned
on
us
a
black
and
frowning
face
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
voice
full
of
bitterness
after
boston
chicago
has
been
the
chief
instrument
in
bringing
war
on
this
country
the
northwest
has
opposed
the
south
as
new
england
has
opposed
the
south
it
is
you
who
are
largely
responsible
for
making
blood
flow
as
it
has
you
called
for
war
until
we
had
it
you
called
for
emancipation
and
i
have
given
it
to
you
whatever
you
have
asked
you
have
had
now
you
come
here
begging
to
be
let
off
from
the
call
for
men
which
i
have
made
to
carry
out
the
war
which
you
demanded
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
i
have
a
right
to
expect
better
things
of
you
go
home
and
raise
your
six
thousand
extra
men
and
you
medill
you
are
acting
like
a
coward
you
and
your
tribune
have
had
more
influence
than
any
paper
in
the
northwest
in
making
this
war
you
can
influence
great
masses
and
yet
you
cry
to
be
spared
at
a
moment
when
your
cause
is
suffering
go
home
and
send
us
those
men
i
couldnt
say
anything
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
was
whipped
and
i
didnt
have
an
answer
we
all
got
up
and
went
out
and
when
the
door
closed
one
of
my
colleagues
said
well
gentlemen
the
old
man
is
right
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
let
us
never
say
anything
about
this
but
go
home
and
raise
the
men
and
we
didsix
thousand
menmaking
twentyeight
thousand
in
the
war
from
a
city
of
one
hundred
and
fiftysix
thousand
but
there
might
have
been
crape
on
every
door
almost
in
chicago
for
every
family
had
lost
a
son
or
a
husband
i
lost
two
brothers
it
was
hard
for
the
mothers
they
didnt
build
it
in
a
delegation
of
new
york
millionaires
waited
upon
president
lincoln
to
request
that
he
furnish
a
gunboat
for
the
protection
of
new
york
harbor
mr
lincoln
after
listening
patiently
said
gentlemen
the
credit
of
the
government
is
at
a
very
low
ebb
greenbacks
are
not
worth
more
than
forty
or
fifty
cents
on
the
dollar
it
is
impossible
for
me
in
the
present
condition
of
things
to
furnish
you
a
gunboat
and
in
this
condition
of
things
if
i
was
worth
half
as
much
as
you
gentlemen
are
represented
to
be
and
as
badly
frightened
as
you
seem
to
be
i
would
build
a
gunboat
and
give
it
to
the
government
stantons
abuse
of
lincoln
president
lincolns
sense
of
duty
to
the
country
together
with
his
keen
judgment
of
men
often
led
to
the
appointment
of
persons
unfriendly
to
him
some
of
these
appointees
were
as
well
not
loyal
to
the
national
government
for
that
matter
regarding
secretary
of
war
stantons
attitude
toward
lincoln
colonel
a
k
mcclure
who
was
very
close
to
president
lincoln
said
after
stantons
retirement
from
the
buchanan
cabinet
when
lincoln
was
inaugurated
he
maintained
the
closest
confidential
relations
with
buchanan
and
wrote
him
many
letters
expressing
the
utmost
contempt
for
lincoln
the
cabinet
the
republican
congress
and
the
general
policy
of
the
administration
these
letters
speak
freely
of
the
painful
imbecility
of
lincoln
of
the
venality
and
corruption
which
ran
riot
in
the
government
and
expressed
the
belief
that
no
better
condition
of
things
was
possible
until
jeff
davis
turns
out
the
whole
concern
he
was
firmly
impressed
for
some
weeks
after
the
battle
of
bull
run
that
the
government
was
utterly
overthrown
as
he
repeatedly
refers
to
the
coming
of
davis
into
the
national
capital
in
one
letter
he
says
that
in
less
than
thirty
days
davis
will
be
in
possession
of
washington
and
it
is
an
open
secret
that
stanton
advised
the
revolutionary
overthrow
of
the
lincoln
government
to
be
replaced
by
general
mcclellan
as
military
dictator
these
letters
bad
as
they
are
are
not
the
worst
letters
written
by
stanton
to
buchanan
some
of
them
were
so
violent
in
their
expressions
against
lincoln
and
the
administration
that
they
have
been
charitably
withheld
from
the
public
but
they
remain
in
the
possession
of
the
surviving
relatives
of
president
buchanan
of
course
lincoln
had
no
knowledge
of
the
bitterness
exhibited
by
stanton
to
himself
personally
and
to
his
administration
but
if
he
had
known
the
worst
that
stanton
ever
said
or
wrote
about
him
i
doubt
not
that
he
would
have
called
him
to
the
cabinet
in
january
the
disasters
the
army
suffered
made
lincoln
forgetful
of
everything
but
the
single
duty
of
suppressing
the
rebellion
lincoln
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
in
his
new
secretary
of
war
he
had
an
invaluable
but
most
troublesome
cabinet
officer
but
he
saw
only
the
great
and
good
offices
that
stanton
was
performing
for
the
imperilled
republic
confidence
was
restored
in
financial
circles
by
the
appointment
of
stanton
and
his
name
as
war
minister
did
more
to
strengthen
the
faith
of
the
people
in
the
government
credit
than
would
have
been
probable
from
the
appointment
of
any
other
man
of
that
day
he
was
a
terror
to
all
the
hordes
of
jobbers
and
speculators
and
campfollowers
whose
appetites
had
been
whetted
by
a
great
war
and
he
enforced
the
strictest
discipline
throughout
our
armies
he
was
seldom
capable
of
being
civil
to
any
officer
away
from
the
army
on
leave
of
absence
unless
he
had
been
summoned
by
the
government
for
conference
or
special
duty
and
he
issued
the
strictest
orders
from
time
to
time
to
drive
the
throng
of
military
idlers
from
the
capital
and
keep
them
at
their
posts
he
was
stern
to
savagery
in
his
enforcement
of
military
law
the
wearied
sentinel
who
slept
at
his
post
found
no
mercy
in
the
heart
of
stanton
and
many
times
did
lincolns
humanity
overrule
his
fiery
minister
any
neglect
of
military
duty
was
sure
of
the
swiftest
punishment
and
seldom
did
he
make
even
just
allowance
for
inevitable
military
disaster
he
had
profound
unfaltering
faith
in
the
union
cause
and
above
all
he
had
unfaltering
faith
in
himself
he
believed
that
he
was
in
all
things
except
in
name
commanderinchief
of
the
armies
and
the
navy
of
the
nation
and
it
was
with
unconcealed
reluctance
that
he
at
times
deferred
to
the
authority
of
the
president
the
negro
and
the
crocodile
in
one
of
his
political
speeches
judge
douglas
made
use
of
the
following
figure
of
speech
as
between
the
crocodile
and
the
negro
i
take
the
side
of
the
negro
but
as
between
the
negro
and
the
white
mani
would
go
for
the
white
man
every
time
lincoln
at
home
noted
that
and
afterwards
when
he
had
occasion
to
refer
to
the
remark
he
said
i
believe
that
this
is
a
sort
of
proposition
in
proportion
which
may
be
stated
thus
as
the
negro
is
to
the
white
man
so
is
the
crocodile
to
the
negro
and
as
the
negro
may
rightfully
treat
the
crocodile
as
a
beast
or
reptile
so
the
white
man
may
rightfully
treat
the
negro
as
a
beast
or
reptile
lincoln
was
ready
to
fight
on
one
occasion
colonel
baker
was
speaking
in
a
courthouse
which
had
been
a
storehouse
and
on
making
some
remarks
that
were
offensive
to
certain
political
rowdies
in
the
crowd
they
cried
take
him
off
the
stand
immediate
confusion
followed
and
there
was
an
attempt
to
carry
the
demand
into
execution
directly
over
the
speakers
head
was
an
old
skylight
at
which
it
appeared
mr
lincoln
had
been
listening
to
the
speech
in
an
instant
mr
lincolns
feet
came
through
the
skylight
followed
by
his
tall
and
sinewy
frame
and
he
was
standing
by
colonel
bakers
side
he
raised
his
hand
and
the
assembly
subsided
into
silence
gentlemen
said
mr
lincoln
let
us
not
disgrace
the
age
and
country
in
which
we
live
this
is
a
land
where
freedom
of
speech
is
guaranteed
mr
baker
has
a
right
to
speak
and
ought
to
be
permitted
to
do
so
i
am
here
to
protect
him
and
no
man
shall
take
him
from
this
stand
if
i
can
prevent
it
the
suddenness
of
his
appearance
his
perfect
calmness
and
fairness
and
the
knowledge
that
he
would
do
what
he
had
promised
to
do
quieted
all
disturbance
and
the
speaker
concluded
his
remarks
without
difficulty
it
was
uphill
work
two
young
men
called
on
the
president
from
springfield
illinois
lincoln
shook
hands
with
them
and
asked
about
the
crops
the
weather
etc
finally
one
of
the
young
men
said
mother
is
not
well
and
she
sent
me
up
to
inquire
of
you
how
the
suit
about
the
wells
property
is
getting
on
lincoln
in
the
same
even
tone
with
which
he
had
asked
the
question
said
give
my
best
wishes
and
respects
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
i
have
so
many
outside
matters
to
attend
to
now
that
i
have
put
that
case
and
others
in
the
hands
of
a
lawyer
friend
of
mine
and
if
you
will
call
on
him
giving
name
and
address
he
will
give
you
the
information
you
want
after
they
had
gone
a
friend
who
was
present
said
mr
lincoln
you
did
not
seem
to
know
the
young
men
he
laughed
and
replied
no
i
had
never
seen
them
before
and
i
had
to
beat
around
the
bush
until
i
found
who
they
were
it
was
uphill
work
but
i
topped
it
at
last

president
lincoln
wrote
to
general
hooker
on
june
warning
hooker
not
to
run
any
risk
of
being
entangled
on
the
rappahannock
like
an
ox
jumped
half
over

and
liable
to
be
torn
by

not
to
go
south
of
the
rappahannock
upon

moving
north
of

i
think
lees
army
and
not

your
true
objective
power
if
he
comes
toward
the

follow
on
his

on

shortening
your

and
tyler
at

if
they
could
hold
out
for
a
few
days
could
you
help
them
if
the
head
of

is
at
martinsburg
and
the
tail
of
it
on

mrs

and
her
attorney

the

of
london
punch
of
september
th
president
lincoln
is
pictured
as
sitting
at
a
table
in
his
law
office
while
in
a
chair
to
his
tight
is
a
client
mrs
north
the
latter
is
a
fine
client
for
any
attorney
to
have
on
his
list
being
wealthy
and
liberal
but
as
the
lady
is
giving
her
counsel
who
has
represented
her
in
a
legal
way
for
four
years
notice
that
she
proposes
to
put
her
legal
business
in
the
hands
of
another
lawyer
the
dejected
look
upon
the
face
of
attorney
lincoln
is
easily
accounted
for
punch
puts
these
words
in
the
ladys
mouth
mrs
north
you
see
mr
lincoln
we
have
failed
utterly
in
our
course
of
action
i
want
peace
and
so
if
you
cannot
effect
an
amicable
arrangement
i
must
put
the
case
into
other
hands
in
this
cartoon
punch
merely
reflected
the
idea
or
sentiment
current
in
england
in
that
the
north
was
much
dissatisfied
with
the
war
policy
of
president
lincoln
and
would
surely
elect
general
mcclellan
to
succeed
the
westerner
in
the
white
house
at
the
election
mcclellan
carried
but
one
northern
statenew

where
he
was
bornpresident
lincoln
sweeping
the
country
like
a
prairie
fire
punch
had
evidently
been
deceived
by
some
bold
bad
man
who
wanted
a
little
spending
money
and
sold
the
prediction
to
the
funny
journal
with
a
certificate
of
character
attached
written
bypossiblya
member
of
the
horse
marines
punch
was
very
much
disgusted
to
find
that
its
credulity
and
faith
in
mankind
had
been
so
imposed
upon
especially
when
the
election
returns
showed
that
thewarisafailure
candidate
ran
so
slowly
that
lincoln
passed
him
as
easily
as
though
the
democratic
nominee
was
tied
to
a
post
satisfaction
to
the
soul
in
the
faraway
days
when
abe
went
to
school
in
indiana
they
had
exercises
exhibitions
and
speakingmeetings
in
the
schoolhouse
or
the
church
and
abe
was
the
star
his
father
was
a
democrat
and
at
that
time
abe
agreed
with
his
parent
he
would
frequently
make
political
and
other
speeches
to
the
boys
and
explain
tangled
questions
booneville
was
the
county
seat
of
warrick
county
situated
about
fifteen
miles
from
gentryville
thither
abe
walked
to
be
present
at
the
sittings
of
the
court
and
listened
attentively
to
the
trials
and
the
speeches
of
the
lawyers
one
of
the
trials
was
that
of
a
murderer
he
was
defended
by
mr
john
breckinridge
and
at
the
conclusion
of
his
speech
abe
was
so
enthusiastic
that
he
ventured
to
compliment
him
breckinridge
looked
at
the
shabby
boy
thanked
him
and
passed
on
his
way
many
years
afterwards
in
breckinridge
called
on
the
president
and
he
was
told
it
was
the
best
speech
that
i
up
to
that
time
had
ever
heard
if
i
could
as
i
then
thought
make
as
good
a
speech
as
that
my
soul
would
be
satisfied
withdrew
the
colt
mr
alcott
of
elgin
ill
tells
of
seeing
mr
lincoln
coming
away
from
church
unusually
early
one
sunday
morning
the
sermon
could
not
have
been
more
than
half
way
through
says
mr
alcott
tad
was
slung
across
his
left
arm
like
a
pair
of
saddlebags
and
mr
lincoln
was
striding
along
with
long
deliberate
steps
toward
his
home
on
one
of
the
street
corners
he
encountered
a
group
of
his
fellowtownsmen
mr
lincoln
anticipated
the
question
which
was
about
to
be
put
by
the
group
and
taking
his
figure
of
speech
from
practices
with
which
they
were
only
too
familiar
said
gentlemen
i
entered
this
colt
but
he
kicked
around
so
i
had
to
withdraw
him
tad
got
his
dollar
no
matter
who
was
with
the
president
or
how
intently
absorbed
his
little
son
tad
was
always
welcome
he
almost
always
accompanied
his
father
once
on
the
way
to
fortress
monroe
he
became
very
troublesome
the
president
was
much
engaged
in
conversation
with
the
party
who
accompanied
him
and
he
at
length
said
tad
if
you
will
be
a
good
boy
and
not
disturb
me
any
more
until
we
get
to
fortress
monroe
i
will
give
you
a
dollar
the
hope
of
reward
was
effectual
for
awhile
in
securing
silence
but
boylike
tad
soon
forgot
his
promise
and
was
as
noisy
as
ever
upon
reaching
their
destination
however
he
said
very
promptly
father
i
want
my
dollar
mr
lincoln
looked
at
him
halfreproachfully
for
an
instant
and
then
taking
from
his
pocketbook
a
dollar
note
he
said
well
my
son
at
any
rate
i
will
keep
my
part
of
the
bargain
tells
an
editor
about
nasby
henry
j
raymond
the
famous
new
york
editor
thus
tells
of
mr
lincolns
fondness
for
the
nasby
letters
it
has
been
well
said
by
a
profound
critic
of
shakespeare
and
it
occurs
to
me
as
very
appropriate
in
this
connection
that
the
spirit
which
held
the
woe
of
lear
and
the
tragedy
of
hamlet
would
have
broken
had
it
not
also
had
the
humor
of
the
merry
wives
of
windsor
and
the
merriment
of
the
midsummer
nights
dream
this
is
as
true
of
mr
lincoln
as
it
was
of
shakespeare
the
capacity
to
tell
and
enjoy
a
good
anecdote
no
doubt
prolonged
his
life
the
saturday
evening
before
he
left
washington
to
go
to
the
front
just
previous
to
the
capture
of
richmond
i
was
with
him
from
seven
oclock
till
nearly
twelve
it
had
been
one
of
his
most
trying
days
the
pressure
of
officeseekers
was
greater
at
this
juncture
than
i
ever
knew
it
to
be
and
he
was
almost
worn
out
among
the
callers
that
evening
was
a
party
composed
of
two
senators
a
representative
an
exlieutenantgovernor
of
a
western
state
and
several
private
citizens
they
had
business
of
great
importance
involving
the
necessity
of
the
presidents
examination
of
voluminous
documents
pushing
everything
aside
he
said
to
one
of
the
party
have
you
seen
the
nasby
papers
no
i
have
not
was
the
reply
who
is
nasby
there
is
a
chap
out
in
ohio
returned
the
president
who
has
been
writing
a
series
of
letters
in
the
newspapers
over
the
signature
of
petroleum
v
nasby
some
one
sent
me
a
pamphlet
collection
of
them
the
other
day
i
am
going
to
write
to
petroleum
to
come
down
here
and
i
intend
to
tell
him
if
he
will
communicate
his
talent
to
me
i
will
swap
places
with
him
thereupon
he
arose
went
to
a
drawer
in
his
desk
and
taking
out
the
letters
sat
down
and
read
one
to
the
company
finding
in
their
enjoyment
of
it
the
temporary
excitement
and
relief
which
another
man
would
have
found
in
a
glass
of
wine
the
instant
he
had
ceased
the
book
was
thrown
aside
his
countenance
relapsed
into
its
habitual
serious
expression
and
the
business
was
entered
upon
with
the
utmost
earnestness
long
and
short
of
it
on
the
occasion
of
a
serenade
the
president
was
called
for
by
the
crowd
assembled
he
appeared
at
a
window
with
his
wife
who
was
somewhat
below
the
medium
height
and
made
the
following
brief
remarks
here
i
am
and
here
is
mrs
lincoln
thats
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
more
pegs
than
holes
some
gentlemen
were
once
finding
fault
with
the
president
because
certain
generals
were
not
given
commands
the
fact
is
replied
president
lincoln
i
have
got
more
pegs
than
i
have
holes
to
put
them
in
webster
couldnt
have
done
more
lincoln
got
even
with
the
illinois
central
railroad
company
in
in
a
most
substantial
way
at
the
same
time
secured
sweet
revenge
for
an
insult
unwarranted
in
every
way
put
upon
him
by
one
of
the
officials
of
that
corporation
lincoln
and
herndon
defended
the
illinois
central
railroad
in
an
action
brought
by
mclean
county
illinois
in
august
to
recover
taxes
alleged
to
be
due
the
county
from
the
road
the
legislature
had
granted
the
road
immunity
from
taxation
and
this
was
a
case
intended
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
the
road
sent
a
retainer
fee
of
in
the
lower
court
the
case
was
decided
in
favor
of
the
railroad
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
followed
was
argued
twice
and
finally
decided
in
favor
of
the
road
this
last
decision
was
rendered
some
time
in
lincoln
then
went
to
chicago
and
presented
the
bill
for
legal
services
lincoln
and
herndon
only
asked
for
more
the
official
to
whom
he
was
referred
after
looking
at
the
bill
expressed
great
surprise
why
sir
he
exclaimed
this
is
as
much
as
daniel
webster
himself
would
have
charged
we
cannot
allow
such
a
claim
why
not
asked
lincoln
we
could
have
hired
firstclass
lawyers
at
that
figure
was
the
response
we
won
the
case
didnt
we
queried
lincoln
certainly
replied
the
official
daniel
webster
then
retorted
lincoln
in
no
amiable
tone
couldnt
have
done
more
and
abe
walked
out
of
the
officials
office
lincoln
withdrew
the
bill
and
started
for
home
on
the
way
he
stopped
at
bloomington
where
he
met
grant
goodrich
archibald
williams
norman
b
judd
o
h
browning
and
other
attorneys
who
on
learning
of
his
modest
charge
for
the
valuable
services
rendered
the
railroad
induced
him
to
increase
the
demand
to
and
to
bring
suit
for
that
sum
this
was
done
at
once
on
the
trial
six
lawyers
certified
that
the
bill
was
reasonable
and
judgment
for
that
sum
went
by
default
the
judgment
was
promptly
paid
and
of
course
his
partner
herndon
got
your
half
billy
without
delay
lincoln
met
clay
when
a
member
of
congress
lincoln
went
to
lexington
kentucky
to
hear
henry
clay
speak
the
westerner
a
kentuckian
by
birth
and
destined
to
reach
the
great
goal
clay
had
so
often
sought
wanted
to
meet
the
millboy
of
the
slashes
the
address
was
a
tame
affair
as
was
the
personal
greeting
when
lincoln
made
himself
known
clay
was
courteous
but
cold
he
may
never
have
heard
of
the
man
then
in
his
presence
who
was
to
secure
without
solicitation
the
prize
which
he
for
many
years
had
unsuccessfully
sought
lincoln
was
disenchanted
his
ideal
was
shattered
one
reason
why
clay
had
not
realized
his
ambition
had
become
apparent
clay
was
cool
and
dignified
lincoln
was
cordial
and
hearty
clays
hand
was
bloodless
and
frosty
with
no
vigorous
grip
in
it
lincolns
was
warm
and
its
clasp
was
expressive
of
kindliness
and
sympathy
reminded
abe
of
a
little
joke
president
lincoln
had
a
little
joke
at
the
expense
of
general
george
b
mcclellan
the
democratic
candidate
for
the
presidency
in
opposition
to
the
westerner
in
mcclellan
was
nominated
by
the
democratic
national
convention
which
assembled
at
chicago
but
after
he
had
been
named
and
also
during
the
campaign
the
military
candidate
was
characteristically
slow
in
coming
to
the
front
president
lincoln
had
his
eye
upon
every
move
made
by
general
mcclellan
during
the
campaign
and
when
reference
was
made
one
day
in
his
presence
to
the
deliberation
and
caution
of
the
new
jerseyite
mr
lincoln
remarked
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
perhaps
he
is
intrenching
the
cartoon
we
reproduce
appeared
in
harpers
weekly
september
th
and
shows
general
mcclellan
with
his
little
spade
in
hand
being
subjected
to
the
scrutiny
of
the
presidentthe
man
who
gave
mcclellan
when
the
latter
was
commanderinchief
of
the
union
forces
every
opportunity
in
the
world
to
distinguish
himself
there
is
a
smile
on
the
face
of
honest
abe
which
shows
conclusively
that
he
does
not
regard
his
political
opponent
as
likely
to
prove
formidable
in
any
way
president
lincoln
sized
up
mcclellan
in
and
knew
to
a
fraction
how
much
of
a
man
he
was
what
he
could
do
and
how
he
went
about
doing
it
mcclellan
was
no
politician
while
the
president
was
the
shrewdest
of
political
diplomats
his
dignity
saved
him
when
washington
had
become
an
armed
camp
and
full
of
soldiers
president
lincoln
and
his
cabinet
officers
drove
daily
to
one
or
another
of
these
camps
very
often
his
outing
for
the
day
was
attending
some
ceremony
incident
to
camp
life
a
military
funeral
a
camp
wedding
a
review
a
flagraising
he
did
not
often
make
speeches
i
have
made
a
great
many
poor
speeches
he
said
one
day
in
excusing
himself
and
i
now
feel
relieved
that
my
dignity
does
not
permit
me
to
be
a
public
speaker
the
man
he
was
looking
for
judge
kelly
of
pennsylvania
who
was
one
of
the
committee
to
advise
lincoln
of
his
nomination
and
who
was
himself
a
great
many
feet
high
had
been
eyeing
lincolns
lofty
form
with
a
mixture
of
admiration
and
possibly
jealousy
this
had
not
escaped
lincoln
and
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
judge
he
inquired
what
is
your
height
six
feet
three
what
is
yours
mr
lincoln
six
feet
four
then
said
the
judge
pennsylvania
bows
to
illinois
my
dear
man
for
years
my
heart
has
been
aching
for
a
president
that
i
could
look
up
to
and
ive
at
last
found
him
his
cabinet
chances
poor
mr
jeriah
bonham
in
describing
a
visit
he
paid
lincoln
at
his
room
in
the
state
house
at
springfield
where
he
found
him
quite
alone
except
that
two
of
his
children
one
of
whom
was
tad
were
with
him
the
door
was
open
we
walked
in
and
were
at
once
recognized
and
seatedthe
two
boys
still
continuing
their
play
about
the
room
tad
was
spinning
his
top
and
lincoln
as
we
entered
had
just
finished
adjusting
the
string
for
him
so
as
to
give
the
top
the
greatest
degree
of
force
he
remarked
that
he
was
having
a
little
fun
with
the
boys
at
another
time
at
lincolns
residence
tad
came
into
the
room
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
his
mouth
to
his
fathers
ear
said
in
a
boys
whisper
ma
says
come
to
supper
all
heard
the
announcement
and
lincoln
perceiving
this
said
you
have
heard
gentlemen
the
announcement
concerning
the
interesting
state
of
things
in
the
diningroom
it
will
never
do
for
me
if
elected
to
make
this
young
man
a
member
of
my
cabinet
for
it
is
plain
he
cannot
be
trusted
with
secrets
of
state
the
general
was
headed
in
a
union
general
operating
with
his
command
in
west
virginia
allowed
himself
and
his
men
to
be
trapped
and
it
was
feared
his
force
would
be
captured
by
the
confederates
the
president
heard
the
report
read
by
the
operator
as
it
came
over
the
wire
and
remarked
once
there
was
a
man
out
west
who
was
heading
a
barrel
as
they
used
to
call
it
he
worked
like
a
good
fellow
in
driving
down
the
hoops
but
just
about
the
time
he
thought
he
had
the
job
done
the
head
would
fall
in
then
he
had
to
do
the
work
all
over
again
all
at
once
a
bright
idea
entered
his
brain
and
he
wondered
how
it
was
he
hadnt
figured
it
out
before
his
boy
a
bright
smart
lad
was
standing
byvery
much
interested
in
the
business
and
lifting
the
young
one
up
he
put
him
inside
the
barrel
telling
him
to
hold
the
head
in
its
proper
place
while
he
pounded
down
the
hoops
on
the
sides
this
worked
like
a
charm
and
he
soon
had
the
heading
done
then
he
realized
that
his
boy
was
inside
the
barrel
and
how
to
get
him
out
he
couldnt
for
his
life
figure
out
general
blank
is
now
inside
the
barrel
headed
in
and
the
job
now
is
to
get
him
out
sugarcoated
government
printer
defrees
when
one
of
the
presidents
messages
was
being
printed
was
a
good
deal
disturbed
by
the
use
of
the
term
sugarcoated
and
finally
went
to
mr
lincoln
about
it
their
relations
to
each
other
being
of
the
most
intimate
character
he
told
the
president
frankly
that
he
ought
to
remember
that
a
message
to
congress
was
a
different
affair
from
a
speech
at
a
mass
meeting
in
illinois
that
the
messages
became
a
part
of
history
and
should
be
written
accordingly
what
is
the
matter
now
inquired
the
president
why
said
defrees
you
have
used
an
undignified
expression
in
the
message
and
reading
the
paragraph
aloud
he
added
i
would
alter
the
structure
of
that
if
i
were
you
defrees
replied
the
president
that
word
expresses
exactly
my
idea
and
i
am
not
going
to
change
it
the
time
will
never
come
in
this
country
when
people
wont
know
exactly
what
sugarcoated
means
could
make
rabbittracks
when
a
grocery
clerk
at
new
salem
the
annual
election
came
around
a
mr
graham
was
clerk
but
his
assistant
was
absent
and
it
was
necessary
to
find
a
man
to
fill
his
place
lincoln
a
tall
young
man
had
already
concentrated
on
himself
the
attention
of
the
people
of
the
town
and
graham
easily
discovered
him
asking
him
if
he
could
write
abe
modestly
replied
i
can
make
a
few
rabbittracks
his
rabbittracks
proving
to
be
legible
and
even
graceful
he
was
employed
the
voters
soon
discovered
that
the
new
assistant
clerk
was
honest
and
fair
and
performed
his
duties
satisfactorily
and
when
the
work
done
he
began
to
entertain
them
with
stories
they
found
that
their
town
had
made
a
valuable
personal
and
social
acquisition
lincoln

marshal
ward
lamon
was
in
president
lincolns
office
in
the
white
house
one
day
and
casually
asked
the
president
if
he
knew
how
the
currency
of
the
country
was
made
greenbacks
were
then
under
full
headway
of
circulation
these
bits
of
paper
being
the
representatives
of
united
state
money
our
currency
was
the
presidents
answer
is
made
as
the
lawyers
would
put
it
in
their
legal
way
in
the
following
manner
towit
the
official
engraver
strikes
off
the
sheets
passes
them
over
to
the
register
of
the
currency
who
after
placing
his
earmarks
upon
them
signs
the
same
the
register
turns
them
over
to
old
father
spinner
who
proceeds
to
embellish
them
with
his
wonderful
signature
at
the
bottom
father
spinner
sends
them
to
secretary
of
the
treasury
chase
and
he
as
a
final
act
in
the
matter
issues
them
to
the
public
as
moneyand
may
the
good
lord
help
any
fellow
that
doesnt
take
all
he
can
honestly
get
of
them
taking
from
his
pocket
a
greenback
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
the
president
then
said
look
at
spinners
signature
was
there
ever
anything
like
it
on
earth
yet
it
is
unmistakable
no
one
will
ever
be
able
to
counterfeit
it
lamon
then
goes
on
to
say
but
i
said
you
certainly
dont
suppose
that
spinner
actually
wrote
his
name
on
that
bill
do
you
certainly
i
do
why
not
queried
mr
lincoln
i
then
asked
how
much
of
this
currency
have
we
afloat
he
remained
thoughtful
for
a
moment
and
then
stated
the
amount
i
continued
how
many
times
do
you
think
a
man
can
write
a
signature
like
spinners
in
the
course
of
twentyfour
hours
the
beam
of
hilarity
left
the
countenance
of
the
president
at
once
he
put
the
greenback
into
his
vest
pocket
and
walked
the
floor
after
awhile
he
stopped
heaved
a
long
breath
and
said
this
thing
frightens
me
he
then
rang
for
a
messenger
and
told
him
to
ask
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
please
come
over
to
see
him
mr
chase
soon
put
in
an
appearance
president
lincoln
stated
the
cause
of
his
alarm
and
asked
mr
chase
to
explain
in
detail
the
operations
methods
system
of
checks
etc
in
his
office
and
a
lengthy
discussion
followed
president
lincoln
contending
there
were
not
sufficient
safeguards
afforded
in
any
degree
in
the
moneymaking
department
and
secretary
chase
insisting
that
every
protection
was
afforded
he
could
devise
afterward
the
president
called
the
attention
of
congress
to
this
important
question
and
devices
were
adopted
whereby
a
check
was
put
upon
the
issue
of
greenbacks
that
no
spurious
ones
ever
came
out
of
the
treasury
department
at
least
counterfeiters
were
busy
though
but
this
was
not
the
fault
of
the

lincolns
apology
to
grant
general

is
a
copious
worker
and
fighter
president
lincoln
wrote
to
general
burnside
in
july
but
a
meagre
writer
or
telegrapher
grant
never
wrote
a
report
until
the
battle
was
over
president
lincoln
wrote
a
letter
to
general
grant
on
july
th
which
indicated
the
strength
of
the
hold
the
successful
fighter
had
upon
the
man
in
the
white
house
it
ran
as
follows
i
do
not
remember
that
you
and
i
ever
met
personally
i
write
this
now
as
a
grateful
acknowledgment
for
the
almost
inestimable
service
you
have
done
the
country
i
write
to
say
a
word
further
when
you
first
reached
the
vicinity
of
vicksburg
i
thought
you
should
do
what
you
finally
didmarch
the
troops
across
the
neck
run
the
batteries
with
the
transports
and
thus
go
below
and
i
never
had
any
faith
except
a
general
hope
that
you
knew
better
than
i
that
the
yazoo
pass
expedition
and
the
like
could
succeed
when
you
got
below
and
took
port
gibson
grand
gulf
and
vicinity
i
thought
you
should
go
down
the
river
and
join
general
banks
and
when
you
turned
northward
east
of
big
black
i
feared
it
was
a
mistake
i
now
wish
to
make
the
personal
acknowledgment
that
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
lincoln
said
by
jing
lincoln
never
used
profanity
except
when
he
quoted
it
to
illustrate
a
point
in
a
story
his
favorite
expressions
when
he
spoke
with
emphasis
were
by
dear
and
by
jing
just
preceding
the
civil
war
he
sent
ward
lamon
on
a
ticklish
mission
to
south
carolina
when
the
proposed
trip
was
mentioned
to
secretary
seward
he
opposed
it
saying
mr
president
i
fear
you
are
sending
lamon
to
his
grave
i
am
afraid
they
will
kill
him
in
charleston
where
the
people
are
excited
and
desperate
we
cant
spare
lamon
and
we
shall
feel
badly
if
anything
happens
to
him
mr
lincoln
said
in
reply
i
have
known
lamon
to
be
in
many
a
close
place
and
he
has
never
been
in
one
that
he
didnt
get
out
of
somehow
by
jing
ill
risk
him
go
ahead
lamon
and
god
bless
you
if
you
cant
bring
back
any
good
news
bring
a
palmetto
lamon
brought
back
a
palmetto
branch
but
no
promise
of
peace
it
tickled
the
little
woman
lincoln
had
been
in
the
telegraph
office
at
springfield
during
the
casting
of
the
first
and
second
ballots
in
the
republican
national
convention
at
chicago
and
then
left
and
went
over
to
the
office
of
the
state
journal
where
he
was
sitting
conversing
with
friends
while
the
third
ballot
was
being
taken
in
a
few
moments
came
across
the
wires
the
announcement
of
the
result
the
superintendent
of
the
telegraph
company
wrote
on
a
scrap
of
paper
mr
lincoln
you
are
nominated
on
the
third
ballot
and
a
boy
ran
with
the
message
to
lincoln
he
looked
at
it
in
silence
amid
the
shouts
of
those
around
him
then
rising
and
putting
it
in
his
pocket
he
said
quietly
theres
a
little
woman
down
at
our
house
would
like
to
hear
this
ill
go
down
and
tell
her
shall
all
fall
together
after
lincoln
had
finished
that
celebrated
speech
in
egypt
as
a
section
of
southern
illinois
was
formerly
designated
in
the
course
of
which
he
seized
congressman
ficklin
by
the
coat
collar
and
shook
him
fiercely
he
apologized
in
return
ficklin
said
lincoln
had
nearly
shaken
the
democracy
out
of
him
to
this
lincoln
replied
that
reminds
me
of
what
paul
said
to
agrippa
which
in
language
and
substance
was
about
this
i
would
to
god
that
such
democracy
as
you
folks
here
in
egypt
have
were
not
only
almost
but
altogether
shaken
out
of
not
only
you
but
all
that
heard
me
this
day
and
that
you
would
all
join
in
assisting
in
shaking
off
the
shackles
of
the
bondmen
by
all
legitimate
means
so
that
this
country
may
be
made
free
as
the
good
lord
intended
it
said
ficklin
in
rejoinder
lincoln
i
remember
of
reading
somewhere
in
the
same
book
from
which
you
get
your
agrippa
story
that
paul
whom
you
seem
to
desire
to
personate
admonished
all
servants
slaves
to
be
obedient
to
them
that
are
their
masters
according
to
the
flesh
in
fear
and
trembling
it
would
seem
that
neither
our
savior
nor
paul
saw
the
iniquity
of
slavery
as
you
and
your
party
do
but
you
must
not
think
that
where
you
fail
by
argument
to
convince
an
old
friend
like
myself
and
win
him
over
to
your
heterodox
abolition
opinions
you
are
justified
in
resorting
to
violence
such
as
you
practiced
on
me
today
why
i
never
had
such
a
shaking
up
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
recollect
that
that
good
old
book
that
you
quote
from
somewhere
says
in
effect
this
woe
be
unto
him
who
goeth
to
egypt
for
help
for
he
shall
fall
the
holpen
shall
fall
and
they
shall
all
fall
together
dead

no

lincolns
quarrel
with
shields
was
his
last
personal
encounter
in
later
years
it
became
his
duty
to
give
an
official
reprimand
to
a
young
officer
who
had
been
courtmartialed
for
a
quarrel
with
one
of
his
associates
the
reprimand
is
probably
the
gentlest
on
record
quarrel
not
at
all
no
man
resolved
to
make
the
most
of
himself
can
spare
time
for
personal
contention
still
less
can
he
afford
to
take
all
the
consequences
including
the
vitiating
of
his
temper
and
the
loss
of
selfcontrol
yield
larger
things
to
which
you
can
show
no
more
than
equal
right
and
yield
lesser
ones
though
clearly
your
own
better
give
your
path
to
a
dog
than
be
bitten
by
him
in
contesting
for
the
right
even
killing
the
dog
would
not
cure
the
bite
thorough
is
a
good
word
some
one
came
to
the
president
with
a
story
about
a
plot
to
accomplish
some
mischief
in
the
government
lincoln
listened
to
what
was
a
very
superficial
and
illformed
story
and
then
said
there
is
one
thing
that
i
have
learned
and
that
you
have
not
it
is
only
one
wordthorough
then
bringing
his
hand
down
on
the
table
with
a
thump
to
emphasize
his
meaning
he
added
thorough
the
cabinet
was
asettin
being
in
washington
one
day
the
rev
robert
collyer
thought
hed
take
a
look
around
in
passing
through
the
grounds
surrounding
the
white
house
he
cast
a
glance
toward
the
presidential
residence
and
was
astonished
to
see
three
pairs
of
feet
resting
on
the
ledge
of
an
open
window
in
one
of
the
apartments
of
the
second
story
the
divine
paused
for
a
moment
calmly
surveyed
the
unique
spectacle
and
then
resumed
his
walk
toward
the
war
department
seeing
a
laborer
at
work
not
far
from
the
executive
mansion
mr
collyer
asked
him
what
it
all
meant
to
whom
did
the
feet
belong
and
particularly
the
mammoth
ones
you
old
fool
answered
the
workman
thats

abe
a
bullet
through
his
hat
a
soldier
tells
the
following
story
of
an
attempt
upon
the
life
of
mr
lincoln
one
night
i
was
doing
sentinel
duty
at
the
entrance
to
the
soldiers
home
this
was
about
the
middle
of
august
about
eleven
oclock
i
heard
a
rifle
shot
in
the
direction
of
the
city
and
shortly
afterwards
i
heard
approaching
hoofbeats
in
two
or
three
minutes
a
horse
came
dashing
up
i
recognized
the
belated
president
the
president
was
bareheaded
the
president
simply
thought
that
his
horse
had
taken
fright
at
the
discharge
of
the
firearms
on
going
back
to
the
place
where
the
shot
had
been
heard
we
found
the
presidents
hat
it
was
a
plain
silk
hat
and
upon
examination
we
discovered
a
bullet
hole
through
the
crown
the
next
day
upon
receiving
the
hat
the
president
remarked
that
it
was
made
by
some
foolish
marksman
and
was
not
intended
for
him
but
added
that
he
wished
nothing
said
about
the
matter
the
president
said
philosophically
i
long
ago
made
up
my
mind
that
if
anybody
wants
to
kill
me
he
will
do
it
besides
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
the
man
who
would
succeed
me
would
be
just
as
objectionable
to
my
enemiesif
i
have
any
one
dark
night
as
he
was
going
out
with
a
friend
he
took
along
a
heavy
cane
remarking
goodnaturedly
mother
mrs
lincoln
has
got
a
notion
into
her
head
that
i
shall
be
assassinated
and
to
please
her
i
take
a
cane
when
i
go
over
to
the
war
department
at
nightwhen
i
dont
forget
it
no
kind
to
get
to
heaven
on
two
ladies
from
tennessee
called
at
the
white
house
one
day
and
begged
mr
lincoln
to
release
their
husbands
who
were
rebel
prisoners
at
johnsons
island
one
of
the
fair
petitioners
urged
as
a
reason
for
the
liberation
of
her
husband
that
he
was
a
very
religious
man
and
rang
the
changes
on
this
pious
plea
madam
said
mr
lincoln
you
say
your
husband
is
a
religious
man
perhaps
i
am
not
a
good
judge
of
such
matters
but
in
my
opinion
the
religion
that
makes
men
rebel
and
fight
against
their
government
is
not
the
genuine
article
nor
is
the
religion
the
right
sort
which
reconciles
them
to
the
idea
of
eating
their
bread
in
the
sweat
of
other
mens
faces
it
is
not
the
kind
to
get
to
heaven
on
later
however
the
order
of
release
was
made
president
lincoln
remarking
with
impressive
solemnity
that
he
would
expect
the
ladies
to
subdue
the
rebellious
spirit
of
their
husbands
and
to
that
end
he
thought
it
would
be
well
to
reform
their
religion
true
patriotism
said
he
is
better
than
the
wrong
kind
of
piety
the
only
real
peacemaker
during
the
presidential
campaign
of
much
illfeeling
was
displayed
by
the
opposition
to
president
lincoln
the
democratic
managers
issued
posters
of
large
dimensions
picturing
the
washington
administration
as
one
determined
to
rule
or
ruin
the
country
while
the
only
salvation
for
the
united
states
was
the
election
of
mcclellan
we
reproduce
one
of
these
campaign

to

mcclellans
availability
lincoln
the
abolitionist
and
davis
the
secessionist
are

as
bigots
of

sort

upon

lines

mcclellan

as
a
military
chieftain
who
would
stand
no
nonsense
who
would
compel
mr
lincoln
and
mr
davis
to
cease
their
quarreling
who
would
order
the
soldiers
on
both
sides
to
quit
their
bloodletting
and
send
the
combatants
back
to
the
farm
workshop
and
countinghouse

the

lovely
the
apple
womans
pass
one
day
when
president
lincoln
was
receiving
callers
a
buxom
irish
woman
came
into
the
office
and
standing
before
the
president
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
said
mr
lincoln
cant
i
sell
apples
on
the
railroad
president
lincoln
replied
certainly
madam
you
can
sell
all
you
wish
but
she
said
you
must
give
me
a
pass
or
the
soldiers
will
not
let
me
president
lincoln
then
wrote
a
few
lines
and
gave
them
to
her
thank
you
sir
god
bless
you
she
exclaimed
as
she
departed
joyfully
split
rails
by
the
yard
it
was
in
the
spring
of
that
abe
lincoln
wearing
a
jean
jacket
shrunken
buckskin
trousers
a
coonskin
cap
and
driving
an
oxteam
became
a
citizen
of
illinois
he
was
physically
and
mentally
equipped
for
pioneer
work
his
first
desire
was
to
obtain
a
new
and
decent
suit
of
clothes
but
as
he
had
no
money
he
was
glad
to
arrange
with
nancy
miller
to
make
him
a
pair
of
trousers
he
to
split
four
hundred
fence
rails
for
each
yard
of
clothfourteen
hundred
rails
in
all
abe
got
the
clothes
after
awhile
it
was
three
miles
from
his
fathers
cabin
to
her
woodlot
where
he
made
the
forest
ring
with
the
sound
of
his
ax
abe
had
helped
his
father
plow
fifteen
acres
of
land
and
split
enough
rails
to
fence
it
and
he
then
helped
to
plow
fifty
acres
for
another
settler
the
question
of
legs
whenever
the
people
of
lincolns
neighborhood
engaged
in
dispute
whenever
a
bet
was
to
be
decided
when
they
differed
on
points
of
religion
or
politics
when
they
wanted
to
get
out
of
trouble
or
desired
advice
regarding
anything
on
the
earth
below
it
above
it
or
under
the
sea
they
went
to
abe
two
fellows
after
a
hot
dispute
lasting
some
hours
over
the
problem
as
to
how
long
a
mans
legs
should
be
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
his
body
stamped
into
lincolns
office
one
day
and
put
the
question
to
him
lincoln
listened
gravely
to
the
arguments
advanced
by
both
contestants
spent
some
time
in
reflecting
upon
the
matter
and
then
turning
around
in
his
chair
and
facing
the
disputants
delivered
his
opinion
with
all
the
gravity
of
a
judge
sentencing
a
fellowbeing
to
death
this
question
has
been
a
source
of
controversy
he
said
slowly
and
deliberately
for
untold
ages
and
it
is
about
time
it
should
be
definitely
decided
it
has
led
to
bloodshed
in
the
past
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
it
will
not
lead
to
the
same
in
the
future
after
much
thought
and
consideration
not
to
mention
mental
worry
and
anxiety
it
is
my
opinion
all
side
issues
being
swept
aside
that
a
mans
lower
limbs
in
order
to
preserve
harmony
of
proportion
should
be
at
least
long
enough
to
reach
from
his
body
to
the
ground
too
many
widows
already
a
union
officer
in
conversation
one
day
told
this
story
the
first
week
i
was
with
my
command
there
were
twentyfour
deserters
sentenced
by
courtmartial
to
be
shot
and
the
warrants
for
their
execution
were
sent
to
the
president
to
be
signed
he
refused
i
went
to
washington
and
had
an
interview
i
said
mr
president
unless
these
men
are
made
an
example
of
the
army
itself
is
in
danger
mercy
to
the
few
is
cruelty
to
the
many
he
replied
mr
general
there
are
already
too
many
weeping
widows
in
the
united
states
for
gods
sake
dont
ask
me
to
add
to
the
number
for
i
wont
do
it
god
needed
that
church
in
the
early
stages
of
the
war
after
several
battles
had
been
fought
union
troops
seized
a
church
in
alexandria
va
and
used
it
as
a
hospital
a
prominent
lady
of
the
congregation
went
to
washington
to
see
mr
lincoln
and
try
to
get
an
order
for
its
release
have
you
applied
to
the
surgeon
in
charge
at
alexandria
inquired
mr
lincoln
yes
sir
but
i
can
do
nothing
with
him
was
the
reply
well
madam
said
mr
lincoln
that
is
an
end
of
it
then
we
put
him
there
to
attend
to
just
such
business
and
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
knows
better
what
should
be
done
under
the
circumstances
than
i
do
the
ladys
face
showed
her
keen
disappointment
in
order
to
learn
her
sentiment
mr
lincoln
asked
how
much
would
you
be
willing
to
subscribe
toward
building
a
hospital
there
she
said
that
the
war
had
depreciated
southern
property
so
much
that
she
could
afford
to
give
but
little
this
war
is
not
over
yet
said
mr
lincoln
and
there
will
likely
be
another
fight
very
soon
that
church
may
be
very
useful
in
which
to
house
our
wounded
soldiers
it
is
my
candid
opinion
that
god
needs
that
church
for
our
wounded
fellows
so
madam
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
the
man
down
south
an
amusing
instance
of
the
presidents
preoccupation
of
mind
occurred
at
one
of
his
levees
when
he
was
shaking
hands
with
a
host
of
visitors
passing
him
in
a
continuous
stream
an
intimate
acquaintance
received
the
usual
conventional
handshake
and
salutation
but
perceiving
that
he
was
not
recognized
kept
his
ground
instead
of
moving
on
and
spoke
again
when
the
president
roused
to
a
dim
consciousness
that
something
unusual
had
happened
perceived
who
stood
before
him
and
seizing
his
friends
hand
shook
it
again
heartily
saying
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
excuse
me
for
not
noticing
you
i
was
thinking
of
a
man
down
south
the
man
down
south
was
general
w
t
sherman
then
on
his
march
to
the
sea
couldnt
let
go
the
hog
when
governor
curtin
of
pennsylvania
described
the
terrible
butchery
at
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
mr
lincoln
was
almost
brokenhearted
the
governor
regretted
that
his
description
had
so
sadly
affected
the
president
he
remarked
i
would
give
all
i
possess
to
know
how
to
rescue
you
from
this
terrible
war
then
mr
lincolns
wonderful
recuperative
powers
asserted
themselves
and
this
marvelous
man
was
himself
lincolns
whole
aspect
suddenly
changed
and
he
relieved
his
mind
by
telling
a
story
this
reminds
me
governor
he
said
of
an
old
farmer
out
in
illinois
that
i
used
to
know
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
into
hograising
he
sent
out
to
europe
and
imported
the
finest
breed
of
hogs
he
could
buy
the
prize
hog
was
put
in
a
pen
and
the
farmers
two
mischievous
boys
james
and
john
were
told
to
be
sure
not
to
let
it
out
but
james
the
worst
of
the
two
let
the
brute
out
the
next
day
the
hog
went
straight
for
the
boys
and
drove
john
up
a
tree
then
the
hog
went
for
the
seat
of
james
trousers
and
the
only
way
the
boy
could
save
himself
was
by
holding
on
to
the
hogs
tail
the
hog
would
not
give
up
his
hunt
nor
the
boy
his
hold
after
they
had
made
a
good
many
circles
around
the
tree
the
boys
courage
began
to
give
out
and
he
shouted
to
his
brother
i
say
john
come
down
quick
and
help
me
let
go
this
hog
now
governor
that
is
exactly
my
case
i
wish
some
one
would
come
and
help
me
to
let
the
hog
go
the
cabinet
lincoln
wanted
judge
joseph
gillespie
of
chicago
was
a
firm
friend
of
mr
lincoln
and
went
to
springfield
to
see
him
shortly
before
his
departure
for
the
inauguration
it
was
said
judge
gillespie
lincolns
gethsemane
he
feared
he
was
not
the
man
for
the
great
position
and
the
great
events
which
confronted
him
untried
in
national
affairs
unversed
in
international
diplomacy
unacquainted
with
the
men
who
were
foremost
in
the
politics
of
the
nation
he
groaned
when
he
saw
the
inevitable
war
of
the
rebellion
coming
on
it
was
in
humility
of
spirit
that
he
told
me
he
believed
that
the
american
people
had
made
a
mistake
in
selecting
him
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
he
told
me
if
he
could
select
his
cabinet
from
the
old
bar
that
had
traveled
the
circuit
with
him
in
the
early
days
he
believed
he
could
avoid
war
or
settle
it
without
a
battle
even
after
the
fact
of
secession
but
mr
lincoln
said
i
those
old
lawyers
are
all
democrats
i
know
it
was
his
reply
but
i
would
rather
have
democrats
whom
i
know
than
republicans
i
dont
know
ready
for
butcherday
leonard
swett
told
this
eminently
characteristic
story
i
remember
one
day
being
in
his
room
when
lincoln
was
sitting
at
his
table
with
a
large
pile
of
papers
before
him
and
after
a
pleasant
talk
he
turned
quite
abruptly
and
said
get
out
of
the
way
swett
tomorrow
is
butcherday
and
i
must
go
through
these
papers
and
see
if
i
cannot
find
some
excuse
to
let
these
poor
fellows
off
the
pile
of
papers
he
had
were
the
records
of
courtsmartial
of
men
who
on
the
following
day
were
to
be
shot
the
bad
bird
and
the
mudsill
it
took
quite
a
long
time
as
well
as
the
lives
of
thousands
of
men
to
say
nothing
of
the
cost
in
money
to
take
richmond
the
capital
city
of
the
confederacy
in
this
cartoon
taken
from
frank
leslies
illustrated
newspaper
of
february
jeff
davis
is
sitting
upon
the
secession
eggs
in
the
richmond
nest
smiling
down
upon
president
lincoln
who
is
up
to
his
waist
in
the
mud
of
difficulties
the
president
finally
waded
through
the
morass
in
which
he
had
become
immersed
got
to
the
tree
climbed
its
trunk
reached
the
limb
upon
which
the
bad
bird
had
built
its
nest
threw
the
mother
out
destroyed
the
eggs
of
secession
and
then
took
the
nest
away
with
him
leaving
the
bad
bird
without
any
home
at
all
the
bad
bird
had
its
laugh
first
but
the
last
laugh
belonged
to
the
mudsill
as
the
cartoonist
was
pleased
to
call
the
president
of
the
united
states
it
is
true
that
the
president
got
his
clothes
and
hat
all
covered
with
mud
but
as
the
job
was
a
dirty
one
as
well
as
one
that
had
to
be
done
the
president
didnt
care
he
was
able
to
get
another
suit
of
clothes
as
well
as
another
hat
but
the
bad
bird
couldnt
and
didnt
get
another
nest
the
laugh
was
on
the
bad
bird
after
all
gave
the
soldier
his
fish
once
when
asked
what
he
remembered
about
the
war
with
great
britain
lincoln
replied
nothing
but
this
i
had
been
fishing
one
day
and
caught
a
little
fish
which
i
was
taking
home
i
met
a
soldier
in
the
road
and
having
been
always
told
at
home
that
we
must
be
good
to
the
soldiers
i
gave
him
my
fish
this
must
have
been
about
when
abe
was
five
years
of
age
a
peculiar
lawyer
lincoln
was
once
associate
counsel
for
a
defendant
in
a
murder
case
he
listened
to
the
testimony
given
by
witness
after
witness
against
his
client
until
his
honest
heart
could
stand
it
no
longer
then
turning
to
his
associate
he
said
the
man
is
guilty
you
defend
himi
cant
and
when
his
associate
secured
a
verdict
of
acquittal
lincoln
refused
to
share
the
fee
to
the
extent
of
one
cent
lincoln
would
never
advise
clients
to
enter
into
unwise
or
unjust
lawsuits
always
preferring
to
refuse
a
retainer
rather
than
be
a
party
to
a
case
which
did
not
commend
itself
to
his
sense
of
justice
if
theyd
only
skip
general
creswell
called
at
the
white
house
to
see
the
president
the
day
of
the
latters
assassination
an
old
friend
serving
in
the
confederate
ranks
had
been
captured
by
the
union
troops
and
sent
to
prison
he
had
drawn
an
affidavit
setting
forth
what
he
knew
about
the
man
particularly
mentioning
extenuating
circumstances
creswell
found
the
president
very
happy
he
was
greeted
with
creswell
old
fellow
everything
is
bright
this
morning
the
war
is
over
it
has
been
a
tough
time
but
we
have
lived
it
outor
some
of
us
have
and
he
dropped
his
voice
a
little
on
the
last
clause
of
the
sentence
but
it
is
over
we
are
going
to
have
good
times
now
and
a
united
country
general
creswell
told
his
story
read
his
affidavit
and
said
i
know
the
man
has
acted
like
a
fool
but
he
is
my
friend
and
a
good
fellow
let
him
out
give
him
to
me
and
i
will
be
responsible
that
he
wont
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
rebs
creswell
replied
mr
lincoln
you
make
me
think
of
a
lot
of
young
folks
who
once
started
out
maying
to
reach
their
destination
they
had
to
cross
a
shallow
stream
and
did
so
by
means
of
an
old
flatboat
when
the
time
came
to
return
they
found
to
their
dismay
that
the
old
scow
had
disappeared
they
were
in
sore
trouble
and
thought
over
all
manner
of
devices
for
getting
over
the
water
but
without
avail
after
a
time
one
of
the
boys
proposed
that
each
fellow
should
pick
up
the
girl
he
liked
best
and
wade
over
with
her
the
masterly
proposition
was
carried
out
until
all
that
were
left
upon
the
island
was
a
little
short
chap
and
a
great
long
gothicbuilt
elderly
lady
now
creswell
you
are
trying
to
leave
me
in
the
same
predicament
you
fellows
are
all
getting
your
own
friends
out
of
this
scrape
and
you
will
succeed
in
carrying
off
one
after
another
until
nobody
but
jeff
davis
and
myself
will
be
left
on
the
island
and
then
i
wont
know
what
to
do
how
should
i
feel
how
should
i
look
lugging
him
over
i
guess
the
way
to
avoid
such
an
embarrassing
situation
is
to
let
them
all
out
at
once
he
made
a
somewhat
similar
illustration
at
an
informal
cabinet
meeting
at
which
the
disposition
of
jefferson
davis
and
other
prominent
confederates
was
discussed
each
member
of
the
cabinet
gave
his
opinion
most
of
them
were
for
hanging
the
traitors
or
for
some
severe
punishment
president
lincoln
said
nothing
finally
joshua
f
speed
his
old
and
confidential
friend
who
had
been
invited
to
the
meeting
said
i
have
heard
the
opinion
of
your
ministers
and
would
like
to
hear
yours
well
josh
replied
president
lincoln
when
i
was
a
boy
in
indiana
i
went
to
a
neighbors
house
one
morning
and
found
a
boy
of
my
own
size
holding
a
coon
by
a
string
i
asked
him
what
he
had
and
what
he
was
doing
he
says
its
a
coon
dad
cotched
six
last
night
and
killed
all
but
this
poor
little
cuss
dad
told
me
to
hold
him
until
he
came
back
and
im
afraid
hes
going
to
kill
this
one
too
and
oh
abe
i
do
wish
he
would
get
away
well
why
dont
you
let
him
loose
that
wouldnt
be
right
and
if
i
let
him
go
dad
would
give
me
h
but
if
he
got
away
himself
it
would
be
all
right
now
said
the
president
if
jeff
davis
and
those
other
fellows
will
only
get
away
it
will
be
all
right
but
if
we
should
catch
them
and
i
should
let
them
go
dad
would
give
me
h
father
of
the
greenback
don
piatt
a
noted
journalist
of
washington
told
the
story
of
the
first
proposition
to
president
lincoln
to
issue
interestbearing
notes
as
currency
as
follows
amasa
walker
a
distinguished
financier
of
new
england
suggested
that
notes
issued
directly
from
the
government
to
the
people
as
currency
should
bear
interest
this
for
the
purpose
not
only
of
making
the
notes
popular
but
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
inflation
by
inducing
people
to
hoard
the
notes
as
an
investment
when
the
demands
of
trade
would
fail
to
call
them
into
circulation
as
a
currency
this
idea
struck
david
taylor
of
ohio
with
such
force
that
he
sought
mr
lincoln
and
urged
him
to
put
the
project
into
immediate
execution
the
president
listened
patiently
and
at
the
end
said
that
is
a
good
idea
taylor
but
you
must
go
to
chase
he
is
running
that
end
of
the
machine
and
has
time
to
consider
your
proposition
taylor
sought
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
laid
before
him
amasa
walkers
plan
secretary
chase
heard
him
through
in
a
cold
unpleasant
manner
and
then
said
that
is
all
very
well
mr
taylor
but
there
is
one
little
obstacle
in
the
way
that
makes
the
plan
impracticable
and
that
is
the
constitution
saying
this
he
turned
to
his
desk
as
if
dismissing
both
mr
taylor
and
his
proposition
at
the
same
moment
the
poor
enthusiast
felt
rebuked
and
humiliated
he
returned
to
the
president
however
and
reported
his
defeat
mr
lincoln
looked
at
the
wouldbe
financier
with
the
expression
at
times
so
peculiar
to
his
homely
face
that
left
one
in
doubt
whether
he
was
jesting
or
in
earnest
taylor
he
exclaimed
go
back
to
chase
and
tell
him
not
to
bother
himself
about
the
constitution
say
that
i
have
that
sacred
instrument
here
at
the
white
house
and
i
am
guarding
it
with
great
care
taylor
demurred
to
this
on
the
ground
that
secretary
chase
showed
by
his
manner
that
he
knew
all
about
it
and
didnt
wish
to
be
bored
by
any
suggestion
well
see
about
that
said
the
president
and
taking
a
card
from
the
table
he
wrote
upon
it
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
please
consider
mr
taylors
proposition
we
must
have
money
and
i
think
this
a
good
way
to
get
it
a
lincoln
major
andersons
bad
memory
among
the
men
whom
captain
lincoln
met
in
the
black
hawk
campaign
were
lieutenantcolonel
zachary
taylor
lieutenant
jefferson
davis
president
of
the
confederacy
and
lieutenant
robert
anderson
all
of
the
united
states
army
judge
arnold
in
his
life
of
abraham
lincoln
relates
that
lincoln
and
anderson
did
not
meet
again
until
some
time
in
after
anderson
had
evacuated
fort
sumter
on
visiting
washington
he
called
at
the
white
house
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
president
lincoln
expressed
his
thanks
to
anderson
for
his
conduct
at
fort
sumter
and
then
said
major
do
you
remember
of
ever
meeting
me
before
no
mr
president
i
have
no
recollection
of
ever
having
had
that
pleasure
my
memory
is
better
than
yours
said
lincoln
you
mustered
me
into
the
service
of
the
united
states
in
at
dixons
ferry
in
the
black
hawk
war
no
vanderbilt
in
february
not
long
before
his
nomination
for
the
presidency
lincoln
made
several
speeches
in
eastern
cities
to
an
illinois
acquaintance
whom
he
met
at
the
astor
house
in
new
york
he
said
i
have
the
cottage
at
springfield
and
about
three
thousand
dollars
in
money
if
they
make
me
vicepresident
with
seward
as
some
say
they
will
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
increase
it
to
twenty
thousand
and
that
is
as
much
as
any
man
ought
to
want
squashed
a
brutal
lie
in
september
a
new
york
paper
printed
the
following
brutal
story
a
few
days
after
the
battle
of
antietam
the
president
was
driving
over
the
field
in
an
ambulance
accompanied
by
marshal
lamon
general
mcclellan
and
another
officer
heavy
details
of
men
were
engaged
in
the
task
of
burying
the
dead
the
ambulance
had
just
reached
the
neighborhood
of
the
old
stone
bridge
where
the
dead
were
piled
highest
when
mr
lincoln
suddenly
slapping
marshal
lamon
on
the
knee
exclaimed
come
lamon
give
us
that
song
about
picayune
butler
mcclellan
has
never
heard
it
not
now
if
you
please
said
general
mcclellan
with
a
shudder
i
would
prefer
to
hear
it
some
other
place
and
time
president
lincoln
refused
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
story
would
not
read
the
comments
made
upon
it
by
the
newspapers
and
would
permit
neither
denial
nor
explanation
to
be
made
the
national
election
was
coming
on
and
the
presidents
friends
appealed
to
him
to
settle
the
matter
for
once
and
all
marshal
lamon
was
particularly
insistent
but
the
president
merely
said
let
the
thing
alone
if
i
have
not
established
character
enough
to
give
the
lie
to
this
charge
i
can
only
say
that
i
am
mistaken
in
my
own
estimate
of
myself
in
politics
every
man
must
skin
his
own
skunk
these
fellows
are
welcome
to
the
hide
of
this
one
its
body
has
already
given
forth
its
unsavory
odor
but
lamon
would
not
let
the
thing
alone
he
submitted
to
lincoln
a
draft
of
what
he
conceived
to
be
a
suitable
explanation
after
reading
which
the
president
said
lamon
your
explanation
is
entirely
too
belligerent
in
tone
for
so
grave
a
matter
there
is
a
heap
of
cussedness
mixed
up
with
your
usual
amiability
and
you
are
at
times
too
fond
of
a
fight
if
i
were
you
i
would
simply
state
the
facts
as
they
were
i
would
give
the
statement
as
you
have
here
without
the
pepper
and
salt
let
me
try
my
hand
at
it
the
president
then
took
up
a
pen
and
wrote
the
following
which
was
copied
and
sent
out
as
marshal
lamons
refutation
of
the
shameless
slander
the
president
has
known
me
intimately
for
nearly
twenty
years
and
has
often
heard
me
sing
little
ditties
the
battle
of
antietam
was
fought
on
the
th
day
of
september
on
the
first
day
of
october
just
two
weeks
after
the
battle
the
president
with
some
others
including
myself
started
from
washington
to
visit
the
army
reaching
harpers
ferry
at
noon
of
that
day
in
a
short
while
general
mcclellan
came
from
his
headquarters
near
the
battleground
joined
the
president
and
with
him
reviewed
the
troops
at
bolivar
heights
that
afternoon
and
at
night
returned
to
his
headquarters
leaving
the
president
at
harpers
ferry
on
the
morning
of
the
second
the
president
with
general
sumner
reviewed
the
troops
respectively
at
loudon
heights
and
maryland
heights
and
at
about
noon
started
to
general
mcclellans
headquarters
reaching
there
only
in
time
to
see
very
little
before
night
on
the
morning
of
the
third
all
started
on
a
review
of
the
third
corps
and
the
cavalry
in
the
vicinity
of
the
antietam
battleground
after
getting
through
with
general
burnsides
corps
at
the
suggestion
of
general
mcclellan
he
and
the
president
left
their
horses
to
be
led
and
went
into
an
ambulance
to
go
to
general
fitz
john
porters
corps
which
was
two
or
three
miles
distant
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
president
and
general
mcclellan
were
in
the
same
ambulance
or
in
different
ones
but
myself
and
some
others
were
in
the
same
with
the
president
on
the
way
and
on
no
part
of
the
battleground
and
on
what
suggestions
i
do
not
remember
the
president
asked
me
to
sing
the
little
sad
song
that
follows
twenty
years
ago
tom
which
he
had
often
heard
me
sing
and
had
always
seemed
to
like
very
much
after
it
was
over
some
one
of
the
party
i
do
not
think
it
was
the
president
asked
me
to
sing
something
else
and
i
sang
two
or
three
little
comic
things
of
which
picayune
butler
was
one
porters
corps
was
reached
and
reviewed
then
the
battleground
was
passed
over
and
the
most
noted
parts
examined
then
in
succession
the
cavalry
and
franklins
corps
were
reviewed
and
the
president
and
party
returned
to
general
mcclellans
headquarters
at
the
end
of
a
very
hard
hot
and
dusty
days
work
next
day
the
th
the
president
and
general
mcclellan
visited
such
of
the
wounded
as
still
remained
in
the
vicinity
including
the
now
lamented
general
richardson
then
proceeded
to
and
examined
the
southmountain
battleground
at
which
point
they
parted
general
mcclellan
returning
to
his
camp
and
the
president
returning
to
washington
seeing
on
the
way
general
hartsoff
who
lay
wounded
at
frederick
town
this
is
the
whole
story
of
the
singing
and
its
surroundings
neither
general
mcclellan
nor
any
one
else
made
any
objections
to
the
singing
the
place
was
not
on
the
battlefield
the
time
was
sixteen
days
after
the
battle
no
dead
body
was
seen
during
the
whole
time
the
president
was
absent
from
washington
nor
even
a
grave
that
had
not
been
rained
on
since
the
time
it
was
made
one
war
at
a
time
nothing
in
lincolns
entire
career
better
illustrated
the
surprising
resources
of
his
mind
than
his
manner
of
dealing
with
the
trent
affair
the
readiness
and
ability
with
which
he
met
this
perilous
emergency
in
a
field
entirely
new
to
his
experience
was
worthy
the
most
accomplished
diplomat
and
statesman
admirable
also
was
his
cool
courage
and
selfreliance
in
following
a
course
radically
opposed
to
the
prevailing
sentiment
throughout
the
country
and
in
congress
and
contrary
to
the
advice
of
his
own
cabinet
secretary
of
the
navy
welles
hastened
to
approve
officially
the
act
of
captain
wilkes
in
apprehending
the
confederate
commissioners
mason
and
slidell
secretary
stanton
publicly
applauded
and
even
secretary
of
state
seward
whose
long
public
career
had
made
him
especially
conservative
stated
that
he
was
opposed
to
any
concession
or
surrender
of
mason
and
slidell
but
lincoln
with
great
sagacity
simply
said
one
war
at
a
time
president
lincolns
last
public
address
the
president
made
his
last
public
address
on
the
evening
of
april
th
to
a
gathering
at
the
white
house
said
he
we
meet
this
evening
not
in
sorrow
but
in
gladness
of
heart
the
evacuation
of
petersburg
and
richmond
and
the
surrender
of
the
principal
insurgent
army
give
hope
of
a
righteous
and
speedy
peace
whose
joyous
expression
cannot
be
restrained
in
the
midst
of
this
however
he
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
must
not
be
forgotten
nor
must
those
whose
harder
part
gives
us
the
cause
of
rejoicing
be
overlooked
their
honors
must
not
be
parceled
out
with
others
i
myself
was
near
the
front
and
had
the
high
pleasure
of
transmitting
the
good
news
to
you
but
no
part
of
the
honor
for
plan
or
execution
is
mine
to
general
grant
his
skillful
officers
and
brave
men
all
belongs
no
others
like
them
one
day
an
old
lady
from
the
country
called
on
president
lincoln
her
tanned
face
peering
up
to
his
through
a
pair
of
spectacles
her
errand
was
to
present
mr
lincoln
a
pair
of
stockings
of
her
own
make
a
yard
long
kind
tears
came
to
his
eyes
as
she
spoke
to
him
and
then
holding
the
stockings
one
in
each
hand
dangling
wide
apart
for
general
inspection
he
assured
her
that
he
should
take
them
with
him
to
washington
where
and
here
his
eyes
twinkled
he
was
sure
he
should
not
be
able
to
find
any
like
them
quite
a
number
of
wellknown
men
were
in
the
room
with
the
president
when
the
old
lady
made
her
presentation
among
them
was
george
s
boutwell
who
afterwards
became
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
amusement
of
the
company
was
not
at
all
diminished
by
mr
boutwells
remark
that
the
lady
had
evidently
made
a
very
correct
estimate
of
mr
lincolns
latitude
and
longitude
cash
was
at
hand
lincoln
was
appointed
postmaster
at
new
salem
by
president
jackson
the
office
was
given
him
because
everybody
liked
him
and
because
he
was
the
only
man
willing
to
take
it
who
could
make
out
the
returns
lincoln
was
pleased
because
it
gave
him
a
chance
to
read
every
newspaper
taken
in
the
vicinity
he
had
never
been
able
to
get
half
the
newspapers
he
wanted
before
years
after
the
postoffice
had
been
discontinued
and
lincoln
had
become
a
practicing
lawyer
at
springfield
an
agent
of
the
postoffice
department
entered
his
office
and
inquired
if
abraham
lincoln
was
within
lincoln
responded
to
his
name
and
was
informed
that
the
agent
had
called
to
collect
the
balance
due
the
department
since
the
discontinuance
of
the
new
salem
office
a
shade
of
perplexity
passed
over
lincolns
face
which
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
friends
present
one
of
them
said
at
once
lincoln
if
you
are
in
want
of
money
let
us
help
you
he
made
no
reply
but
suddenly
rose
and
pulled
out
from
a
pile
of
books
a
little
old
trunk
and
returning
to
the
table
asked
the
agent
how
much
the
amount
of
his
debt
was
the
sum
was
named
and
then
lincoln
opened
the
trunk
pulled
out
a
little
package
of
coin
wrapped
in
a
cotton
rag
and
counted
out
the
exact
sum
amounting
to
more
than
seventeen
dollars
after
the
agent
had
left
the
room
he
remarked
quietly
that
he
had
never
used
any
mans
money
but
his
own
although
this
sum
had
been
in
his
hands
during
all
those
years
he
had
never
regarded
it
as
available
even
for
any
temporary
use
of
his
own
welcomed
the
little
girls
at
a
saturday
afternoon
reception
at
the
white
house
many
persons
noticed
three
little
girls
poorly
dressed
the
children
of
some
mechanic
or
laboring
man
who
had
followed
the
visitors
into
the
white
house
to
gratify
their
curiosity
they
passed
around
from
room
to
room
and
were
hastening
through
the
receptionroom
with
some
trepidation
when
the
president
called
to
them
little
girls
are
you
going
to
pass
me
without
shaking
hands
then
he
bent
his
tall
awkward
form
down
and
shook
each
little
girl
warmly
by
the
hand
everybody
in
the
apartment
was
spellbound
by
the
incident
so
simple
in
itself
dont
swap
horses
uncle
sam
was
pretty
well
satisfied
with
his
horse
old
abe
and
as
shown
at
the
presidential
election
of
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
him
and
not
swap
the
tried
and
true
animal
for
a
strange
one
harpers
weekly
of
november
th
had
a
cartoon
which
illustrated
how
the
people
of
the
united
states
felt
about
the
matter
better
than
anything
published
at
the
time
we
reproduce
it
on
this
page
beneath
the
picture
was
this
text
john
bull
why
dont
you
ride
the
other
horse
a
bit
hes
the
best
animal
pointing
to
mcclellan
in
the
bushes
at
the
rear
brother
jonathan
well
that
may
be
but
the
fact
is
old
abe
is
just
where
i
can
put
my
finger
on
him
and
as
for
the
otherthough
they
say
hes
some
when
out
in
the
scrub
yonderi
never
know
where
to
find
him
most
valuable
political
attribute
one
time
i
remember
i
asked
mr
lincoln
what
attribute
he
considered
most
valuable
to
the
successful
politician
said
captain
t
w
s
kidd
of
springfield
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
very
earnestly
to
be
able
to
raise
a
cause
which
shall
produce
an
effect
and
then
fight
the
effect
the
more
you
think
about
it
the
more
profound
does
it
become
abe
resented
the
insult
a
cashiered
officer
seeking
to
be
restored
through
the
power
of
the
executive
became
insolent
because
the
president
who
believed
the
man
guilty
would
not
accede
to
his
repeated
requests
at
last
said
well
mr
president
i
see
you
are
fully
determined
not
to
do
me
justice
this
was
too
aggravating
even
for
mr
lincoln
rising
he
suddenly
seized
the
disgraced
officer
by
the
coat
collar
and
marched
him
forcibly
to
the
door
saying
as
he
ejected
him
into
the
passage
sir
i
give
you
fair
warning
never
to
show
your
face
in
this
room
again
i
can
bear
censure
but
not
insult
i
never
wish
to
see
your
face
again

salmon
p
chase
when
secretary
of
the
treasury
had
a
disagreement
with
other
members
of
the
cabinet
and
resigned
the
president
was
urged
not
to
accept
it
as
secretary
chase
is
today
a
national
necessity
his
advisers
said
how
mistaken
you
are
lincoln
quietly
observed
yet
it
is
not
strange
i
used
to
have
similar
notions
no
if
we
should
all
be
turned
out
tomorrow
and
could
come
back
here
in
a
week
we
should
find
our
places
filled
by
a
lot
of
fellows
doing
just
as
well
as
we
did
and
in
many
instances
better
now
this
reminds
me
of
what
the
irishman
said
his
verdict
was
that
in
this
country
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
and
for
the
matter
of
that
very
often
a
great
deal
better
no
this
government
does
not
depend
upon
the
life
of
any
man

the
facts
george
b
lincoln
a
prominent
merchant
of
brooklyn
was
traveling
through
the
west
in
and
found
himself
one
night
in
a
town
on
the
illinois
river
by
the
name
of
naples
the
only
tavern
of
the
place
had
evidently
been
constructed
with
reference
to
business
on
a
small
scale
poor
as
the
prospect
seemed
mr
lincoln
had
no
alternative
but
to
put
up
at
the
place
the
supperroom
was
also
used
as
a
lodgingroom
mr
lincoln
told
his
host
that
he
thought
he
would
go
to
bed
bed
echoed
the
landlord
there
is
no
bed
for
you
in
this
house
unless
you
sleep
with
that
man
yonder
he
has
the
only
one
we
have
to
spare
well
returned
mr
lincoln
the
gentleman
has
possession
and
perhaps
would
not
like
a
bedfellow
upon
this
a
grizzly
head
appeared
out
of
the
pillows
and
said
what
is
your
name
they
call
me
lincoln
at
home
was
the
reply
lincoln
repeated
the
stranger
any
connection
of
our
illinois
abraham
no
replied
mr
lincoln
i
fear
not
well
said
the
old
gentleman
i
will
let
any
man
by
the
name
of
lincoln
sleep
with
me
just
for
the
sake
of
the
name
you
have
heard
of
abe
he
inquired
oh
yes
very
often
replied
mr
lincoln
no
man
could
travel
far
in
this
state
without
hearing
of
him
and
i
would
be
very
glad
to
claim
connection
if
i
could
do
so
honestly
well
said
the
old
gentleman
my
name
is
simmons
abe
and
i
used
to
live
and
work
together
when
young
men
many
a
job
of
woodcutting
and
railsplitting
have
i
done
up
with
him
abe
lincoln
was
the
likeliest
boy
in
gods
world
he
would
work
all
day
as
hard
as
any
of
us
and
study
by
firelight
in
the
loghouse
half
the
night
and
in
this
way
he
made
himself
a
thorough
practical
surveyor
once
during
those
days
i
was
in
the
upper
part
of
the
state
and
i
met
general
ewing
whom
president
jackson
had
sent
to
the
northwest
to
make
surveys
i
told
him
about
abe
lincoln
what
a
student
he
was
and
that
i
wanted
he
should
give
him
a
job
he
looked
over
his
memorandum
and
holding
out
a
paper
said
there
is
county
must
be
surveyed
if
your
friend
can
do
the
work
properly
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
him
undertake
itthe
compensation
will
be
six
hundred
dollars
pleased
as
i
could
be
i
hastened
to
abe
after
i
got
home
with
an
account
of
what
i
had
secured
for
him
he
was
sitting
before
the
fire
in
the
logcabin
when
i
told
him
and
what
do
you
think
was
his
answer
when
i
finished
he
looked
up
very
quietly
and
said
mr
simmons
i
thank
you
very
sincerely
for
your
kindness
but
i
dont
think
i
will
undertake
the
job
in
the
name
of
wonder
said
i
why
six
hundred
does
not
grow
upon
every
bush
out
here
in
illinois
i
know
that
said
abe
and
i
need
the
money
bad
enough
simmons
as
you
know
but
i
have
never
been
under
obligation
to
a
democratic
administration
and
i
never
intend
to
be
so
long
as
i
can
get
my
living
another
way
general
ewing
must
find
another
man
to
do
his
work
a
friend
related
this
story
to
the
president
one
day
and
asked
him
if
it
were
true
pollard
simmons
said
lincoln
well
do
i
remember
him
it
is
correct
about
our
working
together
but
the
old
man
must
have
stretched
the
facts
somewhat
about
the
survey
of
the
county
i
think
i
should
have
been
very
glad
of
the
job
at
the
time
no
matter
what
administration
was
in
power
it
lengthened
the
war
president
lincoln
said
long
before
the
national
political
campaign
of
had
opened
if
the
unworthy
ambition
of
politicians
and
the
jealousy
that
exists
in
the
army
could
be
repressed
and
all
unite
in
a
common
aim
and
a
common
endeavor
the
rebellion
would
soon
be
crushed
his
theory
of
the
rebellion
the
president
once
explained
to
a
friend
the
theory
of
the
rebellion
by
the
aid
of
the
maps
before
him
running
his
long
forefinger
down
the
map
he
stopped
at
virginia
we
must
drive
them
away
from
here
manassas
gap
he
said
and
clear
them
out
of
this
part
of
the
state
so
that
they
cannot
threaten
us
here
washington
and
get
into
maryland
we
must
keep
up
a
good
and
thorough
blockade
of
their
ports
we
must
march
an
army
into
east
tennessee
and
liberate
the
union
sentiment
there
finally
we
must
rely
on
the
people
growing
tired
and
saying
to
their
leaders
we
have
had
enough
of
this
thing
we
will
bear
it
no
longer
such
was
president
lincolns
plan
for
heading
off
the
rebellion
in
the
summer
of
how
it
enlarged
as
the
war
progressed
from
a
call
for
seventy
thousand
volunteers
to
one
for
five
hundred
thousand
men
and
is
a
matter
of
wellknown
history
ran
away
when
victorious
three
or
four
days
after
the
battle
of
bull
run
some
gentlemen
who
had
been
on
the
field
called
upon
the
president
he
inquired
very
minutely
regarding
all
the
circumstances
of
the
affair
and
after
listening
with
the
utmost
attention
said
with
a
touch
of
humor
so
it
is
your
notion
that
we
whipped
the
rebels
and
then
ran
away
from
them
wanted
stanton
spanked
old
dennis
hanks
was
sent
to
washington
at
one
time
by
persons
interested
in
securing
the
release
from
jail
of
several
men
accused
of
being
copperheads
it
was
thought
old
dennis
might
have
some
influence
with
the
president
the
latter
heard
dennis
story
and
then
said
i
will
send
for
mr
stanton
it
is
his
business
secretary
stanton
came
into
the
room
stormed
up
and
down
and
said
the
men
ought
to
be
punished
more
than
they
were
mr
lincoln
sat
quietly
in
his
chair
and
waited
for
the
tempest
to
subside
and
then
quietly
said
to
stanton
he
would
like
to
have
the
papers
next
day
when
he
had
gone
dennis
said
abe
if
i
was
as
big
and
as
ugly
as
you
are
i
would
take
him
over
my
knee
and
spank
him
the
president
replied
no
stanton
is
an
able
and
valuable
man
for
this
nation
and
i
am
glad
to
bear
his
anger
for
the
service
he
can
give
the
nation
stanton
was
out
of
town
the
quaint
remark
of
the
president
to
an
applicant
my
dear
sir
i
have
not
much
influence
with
the
administration
was
one
of
lincolns
little
jokes
mr
stanton
secretary
of
war
once
replied
to
an
order
from
the
president
to
give
a
colonel
a
commission
in
place
of
the
resigning
brigadier
i
shant
do
it
sir
i
shant
do
it
it
isnt
the
way
to
do
it
sir
and
i
shant
do
it
i
dont
propose
to
argue
the
question
with
you
sir
a
few
days
after
the
friend
of
the
applicant
who
had
presented
the
order
to
secretary
stanton
called
upon
the
president
and
related
his
reception
a
look
of
vexation
came
over
the
face
of
the
president
and
he
seemed
unwilling
to
talk
of
it
and
desired
the
friend
to
see
him
another
day
he
did
so
when
he
gave
his
visitor
a
positive
order
for
the
promotion
the
latter
told
him
he
would
not
speak
to
secretary
stanton
again
until
he
apologized
oh
said
the
president
stanton
has
gone
to
fortress
monroe
and
dana
is
acting
he
will
attend
to
it
for
you
this
he
said
with
a
manner
of
relief
as
if
it
was
a
piece
of
good
luck
to
find
a
man
there
who
would
obey
his
orders
the
nomination
was
sent
to
the
senate
and
confirmed
identified
the
colored
man
many
applications
reached
lincoln
as
he
passed
to
and
from
the
white
house
and
the
war
department
one
day
as
he
crossed
the
park
he
was
stopped
by
a
negro
who
told
him
a
pitiful
story
the
president
wrote
him
out
a
check
which
read
pay
to
colored
man
with
one
leg
five
dollars
office
seekers
worse
than
war
when
the
republican
party
came
into
power
washington
swarmed
with
officeseekers
they
overran
the
white
house
and
gave
the
president
great
annoyance
the
incongruity
of
a
man
in
his
position
and
with
the
very
life
of
the
country
at
stake
pausing
to
appoint
postmasters
struck
mr
lincoln
forcibly
what
is
the
matter
mr
lincoln
said
a
friend
one
day
when
he
saw
him
looking
particularly
grave
and
dispirited
has
anything
gone
wrong
at
the
front
no
said
the
president
with
a
tired
smile
it
isnt
the
war
its
the
postoffice
at
brownsville
missouri
he
set
em
up
immediately
after
mr
lincolns
nomination
for
president
at
the
chicago
convention
a
committee
of
which
governor
morgan
of
new
york
was
chairman
visited
him
in
springfield
ill
where
he
was
officially
informed
of
his
nomination
after
this
ceremony
had
passed
mr
lincoln
remarked
to
the
company
that
as
a
fit
ending
to
an
interview
so
important
and
interesting
as
that
which
had
just
taken
place
he
supposed
good
manners
would
require
that
he
should
treat
the
committee
with
something
to
drink
and
opening
the
door
that
led
into
the
rear
he
called
out
mary
mary
a
girl
responded
to
the
call
to
whom
mr
lincoln
spoke
a
few
words
in
an
undertone
and
closing
the
door
returned
again
and
talked
with
his
guests
in
a
few
minutes
the
maid
entered
bearing
a
large
waiter
containing
several
glass
tumblers
and
a
large
pitcher
and
placed
them
upon
the
centertable
mr
lincoln
arose
and
gravely
addressing
the
company
said
gentlemen
we
must
pledge
our
mutual
health
in
the
most
healthy
beverage
that
god
has
given
to
manit
is
the
only
beverage
i
have
ever
used
or
allowed
my
family
to
use
and
i
cannot
conscientiously
depart
from
it
on
the
present
occasion
it
is
pure
adams
ale
from
the
spring
and
taking
the
tumbler
he
touched
it
to
his
lips
and
pledged
them
his
highest
respects
in
a
cup
of
cold
water
of
course
all
his
guests
admired
his
consistency
and
joined
in
his
example
wasnt
stantons
say
a
few
days
before
the
presidents
death
secretary
stanton
tendered
his
resignation
as
secretary
of
war
he
accompanied
the
act
with
a
most
heartfelt
tribute
to
mr
lincolns
constant
friendship
and
faithful
devotion
to
the
country
saying
also
that
he
as
secretary
had
accepted
the
position
to
hold
it
only
until
the
war
should
end
and
that
now
he
felt
his
work
was
done
and
his
duty
was
to
resign
mr
lincoln
was
greatly
moved
by
the
secretarys
words
and
tearing
in
pieces
the
paper
containing
the
resignation
and
throwing
his
arms
about
the
secretary
he
said
stanton
you
have
been
a
good
friend
and
a
faithful
public
servant
and
it
is
not
for
you
to
say
when
you
will
no
longer
be
needed
here
several
friends
of
both
parties
were
present
on
the
occasion
and
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
that
witnessed
the
scene
jeffy
threw
up
the
sponge
when
the
war
was
fairly
on
many
people
were
astonished
to
find
that
old
abe
was
a
fighter
from
way
back
no
one
was
the
victim
of
greater
amazement
than
jefferson
davis
president
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
davis
found
out
that
abe
was
not
only
a
hard
hitter
but
had
staying
qualities
of
a
high
order
it
was
a
fight
to
a
finish
with
abe
no
compromises
being
accepted
over
the
title
north
and
south
the
issue
of
frank
leslies
illustrated
newspaper
of
december
th
contained
the
cartoon
see
reproduce
on
this
page
underneath
the
picture
were
the
lines
now
jeffy
when
you
think
you
have
had
enough
of
this
say
so
and
ill
leave
off
see
presidents
message
in
his
message
to
congress
december
th
president
lincoln
said
no
attempt
at
negotiation
with
the
insurgent
leader
could
result
in
any
good
he
would
accept
of
nothing
short
of
the
severance
of
the
union
therefore
father
abraham
getting
jeffys
head
in
chancery
proceeded
to
change
the
appearance
and
size
of
the
secessionists
countenance
much
to
the
grief
and
discomfort
of
the
southerner
it
was
lincolns
idea
to
reestablish
the
union
and
he
carried
out
his
purpose
to
the
very
letter
but
he
didnt
leave
off
until
jeffy
cried
enough
didnt
know
grants
preference
in
october
president
lincoln
while
he
knew
his
reelection
to
the
white
house
was
in
no
sense
doubtful
knew
that
if
he
lost
new
york
and
with
it
pennsylvania
on
the
home
vote
the
moral
effect
of
his
triumph
would
be
broken
and
his
power
to
prosecute
the
war
and
make
peace
would
be
greatly
impaired
colonel
a
k
mcclure
was
with
lincoln
a
good
deal
of
the
time
previous
to
the
november
election
and
tells
this
story
his
usually
sad
face
was
deeply
shadowed
with
sorrow
when
i
told
him
that
i
saw
no
reasonable
prospect
of
carrying
pennsylvania
on
the
home
vote
although
we
had
about
held
our
own
in
the
handtohand
conflict
through
which
we
were
passing
well
what
is
to
be
done
was
lincolns
inquiry
after
the
whole
situation
had
been
presented
to
him
i
answered
that
the
solution
of
the
problem
was
a
very
simple
and
easy
onethat
grant
was
idle
in
front
of
petersburg
that
sheridan
had
won
all
possible
victories
in
the
valley
and
that
if
five
thousand
pennsylvania
soldiers
could
be
furloughed
home
from
each
army
the
election
could
be
carried
without
doubt
lincolns
face
brightened
instantly
at
the
suggestion
and
i
saw
that
he
was
quite
ready
to
execute
it
i
said
to
him
of
course
you
can
trust
want
to
make
the
suggestion
to
him
to
furlough
five
thousand
pennsylvania
troops
for
two
weeks
to
my
surprise
lincoln
made
no
answer
and
the
bright
face
of
a
few
moments
before
was
instantly
shadowed
again
i
was
much
disconcerted
as
i
supposed
that
grant
was
the
one
man
to
whom
lincoln
could
turn
with
absolute
confidence
as
his
friend
i
then
said
with
some
earnestness
surely
mr
president
you
can
trust
grant
with
a
confidential
suggestion
to
furlough
pennsylvania
troops
lincoln
remained
silent
and
evidently
distressed
at
the
proposition
i
was
pressing
upon
him
after
a
few
moments
and
speaking
with
emphasis
i
said
it
cant
be
possible
that
grant
is
not
your
friend
he
cant
be
such
an
ingrate
lincoln
hesitated
for
some
time
and
then
answered
in
these
words
well
mcclure
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
grant
prefers
my
election
to
that
of
mcclellan
i
believe
lincoln
was
mistaken
in
his
distrust
of
grant
justice
vs
numbers
lincoln
was
constantly
bothered
by
members
of
delegations
of
goodygoodies
who
knew
all
about
running
the
war
but
had
no
inside
information
as
to
what
was
going
on
yet
they
poured
out
their
advice
in
streams
until
the
president
was
heartily
sick
of
the
whole
business
and
wished
the
war
would
find
some
way
to
kill
off
these
nuisances
how
many
men
have
the
confederates
now
in
the
field
asked
one
of
these
bores
one
day
about
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
replied
the
president
oh
my
not
so
many
as
that
surely
mr
lincoln
they
have
fully
twelve
hundred
thousand
no
doubt
of
it
you
see
all
of
our
generals
when
they
get
whipped
say
the
enemy
outnumbers
them
from
three
or
five
to
one
and
i
must
believe
them
we
have
four
hundred
thousand
men
in
the
field
and
three
times
four
make
twelvedont
you
see
it
it
is
as
plain
to
be
seen
as
the
nose
on
a
mans
face
and
at
the
rate
things
are
now
going
with
the
great
amount
of
speculation
and
the
small
crop
of
fighting
it
will
take
a
long
time
to
overcome
twelve
hundred
thousand
rebels
in
arms
if
they
can
get
subsistence
they
have
everything
else
except
a
just
cause
yet
it
is
said
that
thrice
is
he
armed
that
hath
his
quarrel
just
i
am
willing
however
to
risk
our
advantage
of
thrice
in
justice
against
their
thrice
in
numbers
no
false
pride
in
lincoln
general
mcclellan
had
little
or
no
conception
of
the
greatness
of
abraham
lincoln
as
time
went
on
he
began
to
show
plainly
his
contempt
of
the
president
frequently
allowing
him
to
wait
in
the
anteroom
of
his
house
while
he
transacted
business
with
others
this
discourtesy
was
so
open
that
mcclellans
staff
noticed
it
and
newspaper
correspondents
commented
on
it
the
president
was
too
keen
not
to
see
the
situation
but
he
was
strong
enough
to
ignore
it
it
was
a
battle
he
wanted
from
mcclellan
not
deference
i
will
hold
mcclellans
horse
if
he
will
only
bring
us
success
he
said
one
day
extra
member
of
the
cabinet
g
h
giddings
was
selected
as
the
bearer
of
a
message
from
the
president
to
governor
sam
houston
of
texas
a
conflict
had
arisen
there
between
the
southern
party
and
the
governor
sam
houston
and
on
march
the
latter
had
been
deposed
when
mr
lincoln
heard
of
this
he
decided
to
try
to
get
a
message
to
the
governor
offering
united
states
support
if
he
would
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
union
party
of
the
state
mr
giddings
thus
told
of
his
interview
with
the
president
he
said
to
me
that
the
message
was
of
such
importance
that
before
handing
it
to
me
he
would
read
it
to
me
before
beginning
to
read
he
said
this
is
a
confidential
and
secret
message
no
one
besides
my
cabinet
and
myself
knows
anything
about
it
and
we
are
all
sworn
to
secrecy
i
am
going
to
swear
you
in
as
one
of
my
cabinet
and
then
he
said
to
me
in
a
jocular
way
hold
up
your
right
hand
which
i
did
now
said
he
consider
yourself
a
member
of
my
cabinet
how
lincoln
was
abused
with
the
possible
exception
of
president
washington
whose
political
opponents
did
not
hesitate
to
rob
the
vocabulary
of
vulgarity
and
wickedness
whenever
they
desired
to
vilify
the
chief
magistrate
lincoln
was
the
most
and
best
abused
man
who
ever
held
office
in
the
united
states
during
the
first
half
of
his
initial
term
there
was
no
epithet
which
was
not
applied
to
him
one
newspaper
in
new
york
habitually
characterized
him
as
that
hideous
baboon
at
the
other
end
of
the
avenue
and
declared
that
barnum
should
buy
and
exhibit
him
as
a
zoological
curiosity
although
the
president
did
not
to
all
appearances
exhibit
annoyance
because
of
the
various
diatribes
printed
and
spoken
yet
the
fact
is
that
his
life
was
so
cruelly
embittered
by
these
and
other
expressions
quite
as
virulent
that
he
often
declared
to
those
most
intimate
with
him
i
would
rather
be
dead
than
as
president
thus
abused
in
the
house
of
my
friends
how
fighting
joe
was
appointed
general
joe
hooker
the
fourth
commander
of
the
noble
but
unfortunate
army
of
the
potomac
was
appointed
to
that
position
by
president
lincoln
in
january
general
scott
for
some
reason
disliked
hooker
and
would
not
appoint
him
hooker
after
some
months
of
discouraging
waiting
decided
to
return
to
california
and
called
to
pay
his
respects
to
president
lincoln
he
was
introduced
as
captain
hooker
and
to
the
surprise
of
the
president
began
the
following
speech
mr
president
my
friend
makes
a
mistake
i
am
not
captain
hooker
but
was
once
lieutenantcolonel
hooker
of
the
regular
army
i
was
lately
a
farmer
in
california
but
since
the
rebellion
broke
out
i
have
been
trying
to
get
into
service
but
i
find
i
am
not
wanted
i
am
about
to
return
home
but
before
going
i
was
anxious
to
pay
my
respects
to
you
and
express
my
wishes
for
your
personal
welfare
and
success
in
quelling
this
rebellion
and
i
want
to
say
to
you
a
word
more
i
was
at
bull
run
the
other
day
mr
president
and
it
is
no
vanity
in
me
to
say
i
am
a
darned
sight
better
general
than
you
had
on
the
field
this
was
said
not
in
the
tone
of
a
braggart
but
of
a
man
who
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
hooker
did
not
return
to
california
but
in
a
few
weeks
captain
hooker
received
from
the
president
a
commission
as
brigadiergeneral
hooker
kept
his
courage
up
the
president
like
old
king
saul
when
his
term
was
about
to
expire
was
in
a
quandary
concerning
a
further
lease
of
the
presidential
office
he
consulted
again
the
prophetess
of
georgetown
immortalized
by
his
patronage
she
retired
to
an
inner
chamber
and
after
raising
and
consulting
more
than
a
dozen
of
distinguished
spirits
from
hades
she
returned
to
the
receptionparlor
where
the
chief
magistrate
awaited
her
and
declared
that
general
grant
would
capture
richmond
and
that
honest
old
abe
would
be
next
president
she
however
as
the
report
goes
told
him
to
beware
of
chase
a
fortunetellers
prediction
lincoln
had
been
born
and
reared
among
people
who
were
believers
in
premonitions
and
supernatural
appearances
all
his
life
and
he
once
declared
to
his
friends
that
he
was
from
boyhood
superstitious
he
at
one
time
said
to
judge
arnold
that
the
near
approach
of
the
important
events
of
his
life
were
indicated
by
a
presentiment
or
a
strange
dream
or
in
some
other
mysterious
way
it
was
impressed
upon
him
that
something
important
was
to
occur
this
was
earlier
than
it
is
said
that
on
his
second
visit
to
new
orleans
lincoln
and
his
companion
john
hanks
visited
an
old
fortunetellera
voodoo
negress
tradition
says
that
during
the
interview
she
became
very
much
excited
and
after
various
predictions
exclaimed
you
will
be
president
and
all
the
negroes
will
be
free
that
the
old
voodoo
negress
should
have
foretold
that
the
visitor
would
be
president
is
not
at
all
incredible
she
doubtless
told
this
to
many
aspiring
lads
but
lincoln
so
it
is
avowed
took
the
prophecy
seriously
too
much
powder
so
great
was
lincolns
anxiety
for
the
success
of
the
union
arms
that
he
considered
no
labor
on
his
part
too
arduous
and
spent
much
of
his
time
in
looking
after
even
the
small
details
admiral
dahlgren
was
sent
for
one
morning
by
the
president
who
said
well
captain
heres
a
letter
about
some
new
powder
after
reading
the
letter
he
showed
the
sample
of
powder
and
remarked
that
he
had
burned
some
of
it
and
did
not
believe
it
was
a
good
articlehere
was
too
much
residuum
i
will
show
you
he
said
and
getting
a
small
piece
of
paper
placed
thereupon
some
of
the
powder
then
went
to
the
fire
and
with
the
tongs
picked
up
a
coal
which
he
blew
clapped
it
on
the
powder
and
after
the
resulting
explosion
added
you
see
there
is
too
much
left
there
sleep
standing
up
mcclellan
was
a
thorn
in
lincolns
sidealways
up
in
the
air
as
the
president
put
itand
yet
he
hesitated
to
remove
him
the
young
napoleon
was
a
good
organizer
but
no
fighter
lincoln
sent
him
everything
necessary
in
the
way
of
men
ammunition
artillery
and
equipments
but
he
was
forever
unready
instead
of
making
a
forward
movement
at
the
time
expected
he
would
notify
the
president
that
he
must
have
more
men
these
were
given
him
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
then
would
come
a
demand
for
more
horses
more
this
and
that
usually
winding
up
with
a
demand
for
still
more
men
lincoln
bore
it
all
in
patience
for
a
long
time
but
one
day
when
he
had
received
another
request
for
more
men
he
made
a
vigorous
protest
if
i
gave
mcclellan
all
the
men
he
asks
for
said
the
president
they
couldnt
find
room
to
lie
down
theyd
have
to
sleep
standing
up
should
have
fought
another
battle
general
meade
after
the
great
victory
at
gettysburg
was
again
face
to
face
with
general
lee
shortly
afterwards
at
williamsport
and
even
the
formers
warmest
friends
agree
that
he
might
have
won
in
another
battle
but
he
took
no
action
he
was
not
a
pushing
man
like
grant
it
was
this
negligence
on
the
part
of
meade
that
lost
him
the
rank
of
lieutenantgeneral
conferred
upon
general
sheridan
a
friend
of
meades
speaking
to
president
lincoln
and
intimating
that
meade
should
have
after
that
battle
been
made
commanderinchief
of
the
union
armies
received
this
reply
from
lincoln
now
dont
misunderstand
me
about
general
meade
i
am
profoundly
grateful
down
to
the
bottom
of
my
boots
for
what
he
did
at
gettysburg
but
i
think
that
if
i
had
been
general
meade
i
would
have
fought
another
battle
lincoln
upbraided
lamon
in
one
of
his
reminiscences
of
lincoln
ward
lamon
tells
how
keenly
the
presidentelect
always
regretted
the
sneaking
in
act
when
he
made
the
celebrated
midnight
ride
which
he
took
under
protest
and
landed
him
in
washington
known
to
but
a
few
lamon
says
the
president
was
convinced
that
he
committed
a
grave
mistake
in
listening
to
the
solicitations
of
a
professional
spy
and
of
friends
too
easily
alarmed
and
frequently
upbraided
me
for
having
aided
him
to
degrade
himself
at
the
very
moment
in
all
his
life
when
his
behavior
should
have
exhibited
the
utmost
dignity
and
composure
neither
he
nor
the
country
generally
then
understood
the
true
facts
concerning
the
dangers
to
his
life
it
is
now
an
acknowledged
fact
that
there
never
was
a
moment
from
the
day
he
crossed
the
maryland
line
up
to
the
time
of
his
assassination
that
he
was
not
in
danger
of
death
by
violence
and
that
his
life
was
spared
until
the
night
of
the
th
of
april
only
through
the
ceaseless
and
watchful
care
of
the
guards
thrown
around
him
marked
out
a
few
words
president
lincoln
was
calm
and
unmoved
when
england
and
france
were
blustering
and
threatening
war
at
lincolns
instance
secretary
of
state
seward
notified
the
english
cabinet
and
the
french
emperor
that
as
ours
was
merely
a
family
quarrel
of
a
strictly
private
and
confidential
nature
there
was
no
call
for
meddling
also
that
they
would
have
a
war
on
their
hands
in
a
very
few
minutes
if
they
didnt
keep
their
hands
off
many
of
sewards
notes
were
couched
in
decidedly
peppery
terms
some
expressions
being
so
tart
that
president
lincoln
ran
his
pen
through
them
lincoln
silences
seward
general
farnsworth
told
the
writer
nearly
twenty
years
ago
that
being
in
the
war
office
one
day
secretary
stanton
told
him
that
at
the
last
cabinet
meeting
he
had
learned
a
lesson
he
should
never
forget
and
thought
he
had
obtained
an
insight
into
mr
lincolns
wonderful
power
over
the
masses
the
secretary
said
a
cabinet
meeting
was
called
to
consider
our
relations
with
england
in
regard
to
the
masonslidell
affair
one
after
another
of
the
cabinet
presented
his
views
and
mr
seward
read
an
elaborate
diplomatic
dispatch
which
he
had
prepared
finally
mr
lincoln
read
what
he
termed
a
few
brief
remarks
upon
the
subject
and
asked
the
opinions
of
his
auditors
they
unanimously
agreed
that
our
side
of
the
question
needed
no
more
argument
than
was
contained
in
the
presidents
few
brief
remarks
mr
seward
said
he
would
be
glad
to
adopt
the
remarks
and
giving
them
more
of
the
phraseology
usual
in
diplomatic
circles
send
them
to
lord
palmerston
the
british
premier
then
said
secretary
stanton
came
the
demonstration
the
president
half
wheeling
in
his
seat
threw
one
leg
over
the
chairarm
and
holding
the
letter
in
his
hand
said
seward
do
you
suppose
palmerston
will
understand
our
position
from
that
letter
just
as
it
is
certainly
mr
president
do
you
suppose
the
london
times
will
certainly
do
you
suppose
the
average
englishman
of
affairs
will
certainly
it
cannot
be
mistaken
in
england
do
you
suppose
that
a
hackman
out
on
his
box
pointing
to
the
street
will
understand
it
very
readily
mr
president
very
well
seward
i
guess
well
let
her
slide
just
as
she
is
and
the
letter
did
slide
and
settled
the
whole
business
in
a
manner
that
was
effective
brought
the
husband
up
one
morning
president
lincoln
asked
major
eckert
on
duty
at
the
white
house
who
is
that
woman
crying
out
in
the
hall
what
is
the
matter
with
her
eckert
said
it
was
a
woman
who
had
come
a
long
distance
expecting
to
go
down
to
the
army
to
see
her
husband
an
order
had
gone
out
a
short
time
before
to
allow
no
women
in
the
army
except
in
special
cases
mr
lincoln
sat
moodily
for
a
moment
after
hearing
this
story
and
suddenly
looking
up
said
lets
send
her
down
you
write
the
order
major
major
eckert
hesitated
a
moment
and
replied
would
it
not
be
better
for
colonel
hardie
to
write
the
order
yes
said
mr
lincoln
that
is
better
let
hardie
write
it
the
major
went
out
and
soon
returned
saying
mr
president
would
it
not
be
better
in
this
case
to
let
the
womans
husband
come
to
washington
mr
lincolns
face
lighted
up
with
pleasure
yes
yes
was
the
presidents
answer
in
a
relieved
tone
thats
the
best
way
bring
him
up
the
order
was
written
and
the
man
was
sent
to
washington
no
war
without
bloodletting
you
cant
carry
on
war
without
bloodletting
said
lincoln
one
day
the
president
although
almost
feminine
in
his
kindheartedness
knew
not
only
this
but
also
that
large
bodies
of
soldiers
in
camp
were
at
the
mercy
of
diseases
of
every
sort
the
result
being
a
heavy
casualty
list
of
the
estimated
halfmillion
men
of
the
union
armies
who
gave
up
their
lives
in
the
war
of
the
rebellionfully
seventyfive
per
cent
died
of
disease
the
soldiers
killed
upon
the
field
of
battle
constituted
a
comparatively
small
proportion
of
the
casualties

london
punch
caricatured
president
lincoln
in
every
possible
way
holding
him
and
the
union
cause
up
to
the
ridicule
of
the
world
so
far
as
it
could
on
august
rd
its
cartoon
entitled
lincolns
two
difficulties
had
the
text
underneath
lincoln
what
no
money
no
men
punch
desired
to
create
the
impression
that
the
washington
government
was
in
a
bad
way
lacking
both
money
and
men
for
the
purpose
of
putting
down
the
rebellion
that
the
united
states
treasury
was
bankrupt
and
the
people
of
the
north
so
devoid
of
patriotism
that
they
would
not
send
men
for
the
army
to
assist
in
destroying
the
confederacy
the
truth
is
that
when
this
cartoon
was
printed
the
north
had
five
hundred
thousand
men
in
the
field
and
before
the
war
closed
had
provided
fully
two
million
and
a
half
troops

in
excess
of

although
the

was
costing

day

august
rd
had
received
eighteen
thousand
additional
men
and
was
in
fine
shape
the
people
of
the
north
stood
ready
to
supply
anything
the
government
needed
so
that
all
things
taken
together
the
punch
cartoon
was
not
exactly
true
as
the
facts
and
figures
abundantly
proved
white
elephant
on
his
hands
an
old
and
intimate
friend
from
springfield
called
on
president
lincoln
and
found
him
much
depressed
the
president
was
reclining
on
a
sofa
but
rising
suddenly
he
said
to
his
friend
you
know
better
than
any
man
living
that
from
my
boyhood
up
my
ambition
was
to
be
president
i
am
president
of
one
part
of
this
divided
country
at
least
but
look
at
me
oh
i
wish
i
had
never
been
born
ive
a
white
elephant
on
my
handsone
hard
to
manage
with
a
fire
in
my
front
and
rear
to
contend
with
the
jealousies
of
the
military
commanders
and
not
receiving
that
cordial
cooperative
support
from
congress
that
could
reasonably
be
expected
with
an
active
and
formidable
enemy
in
the
field
threatening
the
very
lifeblood
of
the
government
my
position
is
anything
but
a
bed
of
roses
when
lincoln
and
grant
clashed
ward
lamon
one
of
president
lincolns
law
partners
and
his
most
intimate
friend
in
washington
has
this
to
relate
i
am
not
aware
that
there
was
ever
a
serious
discord
or
misunderstanding
between
mr
lincoln
and
general
grant
except
on
a
single
occasion
from
the
commencement
of
the
struggle
lincolns
policy
was
to
break
the
backbone
of
the
confederacy
by
depriving
it
of
its
principal
means
of
subsistence
cotton
was
its
vital
aliment
deprive
it
of
this
and
the
rebellion
must
necessarily
collapse
the
hon
elihu
b
washburne
from
the
outset
was
opposed
to
any
contraband
traffic
with
the
confederates
lincoln
had
given
permits
and
passes
through
the
lines
to
two
personsmr
joseph
mattox
of
maryland
and
general
singleton
of
illinoisto
enable
them
to
bring
cotton
and
other
southern
products
from
virginia
washburne
heard
of
it
called
immediately
on
mr
lincoln
and
after
remonstrating
with
him
on
the
impropriety
of
such
a
demarche
threatened
to
have
general
grant
countermand
the
permits
if
they
were
not
revoked
naturally
both
became
excited
lincoln
declared
that
he
did
not
believe
general
grant
would
take
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
such
an
act
i
will
show
you
sir
i
will
show
you
whether
grant
will
do
it
or
not
responded
mr
washburne
as
he
abruptly
withdrew
by
the
next
boat
subsequent
to
this
interview
the
congressman
left
washington
for
the
headquarters
of
general
grant
he
returned
shortly
afterward
to
the
city
and
so
likewise
did
mattox
and
singleton
grant
had
countermanded
the
permits
under
all
the
circumstances
it
was
naturally
a
source
of
exultation
to
mr
washburne
and
his
friends
and
of
corresponding
surprise
and
mortification
to
the
president
the
latter
however
said
nothing
further
than
this
i
wonder
when
general
grant
changed
his
mind
on
this
subject
he
was
the
first
man
after
the
commencement
of
this
war
to
grant
a
permit
for
the
passage
of
cotton
through
the
lines
and
that
to
his
own
father
the
president
however
never
showed
any
resentment
toward
general
grant
in
referring
afterwards
to
the
subject
the
president
said
it
made
me
feel
my
insignificance
keenly
at
the
moment
but
if
my
friends
washburne
henry
wilson
and
others
derive
pleasure
from
so
unworthy
a
victory
over
me
i
leave
them
to
its
full
enjoyment
this
ripple
on
the
otherwise
unruffled
current
of
their
intercourse
did
not
disturb
the
personal
relations
between
lincoln
and
grant
but
there
was
little
cordiality
between
the
president
and
messrs
washburne
and
wilson
afterwards
won
james
gordon
bennetts
support
the
story
as
to
how
president
lincoln
won
the
support
of
james
gordon
bennett
sr
founder
of
the
new
york
herald
is
a
most
interesting
one
it
was
one
of
lincolns
shrewdest
political
acts
and
was
brought
about
by
the
tender
in
an
autograph
letter
of
the
french
mission
to
bennett
the
new
york
times
was
the
only
paper
in
the
metropolis
which
supported
him
heartily
and
president
lincoln
knew
how
important
it
was
to
have
the
support
of
the
herald
he
therefore
according
to
the
way
colonel
mcclure
tells
it
carefully
studied
how
to
bring
its
editor
into
close
touch
with
himself
the
outlook
for
lincolns
reelection
was
not
promising
bennett
had
strongly
advocated
the
nomination
of
general
mcclellan
by
the
democrats
and
that
was
ominous
of
hostility
to
lincoln
and
when
mcclellan
was
nominated
he
was
accepted
on
all
sides
as
a
most
formidable
candidate
it
was
in
this
emergency
that
lincolns
political
sagacity
served
him
sufficiently
to
win
the
herald
to
his
cause
and
it
was
done
by
the
confidential
tender
of
the
french
mission
bennett
did
not
break
over
to
lincoln
at
once
but
he
went
by
gradual
approaches
his
first
step
was
to
declare
in
favor
of
an
entirely
new
candidate
which
was
an
utter
impossibility
he
opened
a
leader
in
the
herald
on
the
subject
in
this
way
lincoln
has
proved
a
failure
mcclellan
has
proved
a
failure
fremont
has
proved
a
failure
let
us
have
a
new
candidate
lincoln
mcclellan
and
fremont
were
then
all
in
the
field
as
nominated
candidates
and
the
fremont
defection
was
a
serious
threat
to
lincoln
of
course
neither
lincoln
nor
mcclellan
declined
and
the
herald
failing
to
get
the
new
man
it
knew
to
be
an
impossibility
squarely
advocated
lincolns
reelection
without
consulting
any
one
and
without
any
public
announcement
whatever
lincoln
wrote
to
bennett
asking
him
to
accept
the
mission
to
france
the
offer
was
declined
bennett
valued
the
offer
very
much
more
than
the
office
and
from
that
day
until
the
day
of
the
presidents
death
he
was
one
of
lincolns
most
appreciative
friends
and
hearty
supporters
on
his
own
independent
line
stood
by
the
silent
man
once
in
reply
to
a
delegation
which
visited
the
white
house
the
members
of
which
were
unusually
vociferous
in
their
demands
that
the
silent
man
as
general
grant
was
called
should
be
relieved
from
duty
the
president
remarked
what
i
want
and
what
the
people
want
is
generals
who
will
fight
battles
and
win
victories
grant
has
done
this
and
i
propose
to
stand
by
him
this
declaration
found
its
way
into
the
newspapers
and
lincoln
was
upheld
by
the
people
of
the
north
who
also
wanted
generals
who
will
fight
battles
and
win
victories
a
very
brainy
nubbin
president
lincoln
and
secretary
of
state
seward
met
alexander
h
stephens
vicepresident
of
the
confederacy
on
february
nd
on
the
river
queen
at
fortress
monroe
stephens
was
enveloped
in
overcoats
and
shawls
and
had
the
appearance
of
a
fairsized
man
he
began
to
take
off
one
wrapping
after
another
until
the
small
shriveled
old
man
stood
before
them
lincoln
quietly
said
to
seward
this
is
the
largest
shucking
for
so
small
a
nubbin
that
i
ever
saw
president
lincoln
had
a
friendly
conference
but
presented
his
ultimatum
that
the
one
and
only
condition
of
peace
was
that
confederates
must
cease
their
resistance
sent
to
his
friends
during
the
civil
war
clement
l
vallandigham
of
ohio
had
shown
himself
in
the
national
house
of
representatives
and
elsewhere
one
of
the
bitterest
and
most
outspoken
of
all
the
men
of
that
class
which
insisted
that
the
war
was
a
failure
he
declared
that
it
was
the
design
of
those
in
power
to
establish
a
despotism
and
that
they
had
no
intention
of
restoring
the
union
he
denounced
the
conscription
which
had
been
ordered
and
declared
that
men
who
submitted
to
be
drafted
into
the
army
were
unworthy
to
be
called
free
men
he
spoke
of
the
president
as
king
lincoln
such
utterances
at
this
time
when
the
government
was
exerting
itself
to
the
utmost
to
recruit
the
armies
were
dangerous
and
vallandigham
was
arrested
tried
by
courtmartial
at
cincinnati
and
sentenced
to
be
placed
in
confinement
during
the
war
general
burnside
in
command
at
cincinnati
approved
the
sentence
and
ordered
that
he
be
sent
to
fort
warren
in
boston
harbor
but
the
president
ordered
that
he
be
sent
beyond
our
lines
into
those
of
his
friends
he
was
therefore
escorted
to
the
confederate
lines
in
tennessee
thence
going
to
richmond
he
did
not
meet
with
a
very
cordial
reception
there
and
finally
sought
refuge
in
canada
vallandigham
died
in
a
most
peculiar
way
some
years
after
the
close
of
the
war
and
it
was
thought
by
many
that
his
death
was
the
result
of
premeditation
upon
his
part
go
down
with
colors
flying
in
august
the
president
called
for
five
hundred
thousand
more
men
the
country
was
much
depressed
the
confederates
had
in
comparatively
small
force
only
a
short
time
before
been
to
the
very
gates
of
washington
and
returned
almost
unharmed
the
presidential
election
was
impending
many
thought
another
call
for
men
at
such
a
time
would
insure
if
not
destroy
mr
lincolns
chances
for
reelection
a
friend
said
as
much
to
him
one
day
after
the
president
had
told
him
of
his
purpose
to
make
such
a
call
as
to
my
reelection
replied
mr
lincoln
it
matters
not
we
must
have
the
men
if
i
go
down
i
intend
to
go
like
the
cumberland
with
my
colors
flying
all
were
tragedies

after
all
and
playwright
stanton
and

were
vindicated
their
compositions
having
been
received
by
the
public
with
great
favor
hes
the
best
of
us
secretary
of
state
seward
did
not
appreciate
president
lincolns
ability
until
he
had
been
associated
with
him
for
quite
a
time
but
he
was
awakened
to
a
full
realization
of
the
greatness
of
the
chief
executive
all
of
a
sudden
having
submitted
some
thoughts
for
the
presidents
considerationa
lengthy
paper
intended
as
an
outline
of
the
policy
both
domestic
and
foreign
the
administration
should
pursuehe
was
not
more
surprised
at
the
magnanimity
and
kindness
of
president
lincolns
reply
than
the
thorough
mastery
of
the
subject
displayed
by
the
president
a
few
months
later
when
the
secretary
had
begun
to
understand
mr
lincoln
he
was
quick
and
generous
to
acknowledge
his
power
executive
force
and
vigor
are
rare
qualities
he
wrote
to
mrs
seward
the
president
is
the
best
of
us
how
lincoln
composed
superintendent
chandler
of
the
telegraph
office
in
the
war
department
once
told
how
president
lincoln
wrote
telegrams
said
he
mr
lincoln
frequently
wrote
telegrams
in
my
office
his
method
of
composition
was
slow
and
laborious
it
was
evident
that
he
thought
out
what
he
was
going
to
say
before
he
touched
his
pen
to
the
paper
he
would
sit
looking
out
of
the
window
his
left
elbow
on
the
table
his
hand
scratching
his
temple
his
lips
moving
and
frequently
he
spoke
the
sentence
aloud
or
in
a
half
whisper
after
he
was
satisfied
that
he
had
the
proper
expression
he
would
write
it
out
if
one
examines
the
originals
of
mr
lincolns
telegrams
and
letters
he
will
find
very
few
erasures
and
very
little
interlining
this
was
because
he
had
them
definitely
in
his
mind
before
writing
them
in
this
he
was
the
exact
opposite
of
mr
stanton
who
wrote
with
feverish
haste
often
scratching
out
words
and
interlining
frequently
sometimes
he
would
seize
a
sheet
which
he
had
filled
and
impatiently
tear
it
into
pieces
hamlin
might
do
it
several
united
states
senators
urged
president
lincoln
to
muster
southern
slaves
into
the
union
army
lincoln
replied
gentlemen
i
have
put
thousands
of
muskets
into
the
hands
of
loyal
citizens
of
tennessee
kentucky
and
western
north
carolina
they
have
said
they
could
defend
themselves
if
they
had
guns
i
have
given
them
the
guns
now
these
men
do
not
believe
in
musteringin
the
negro
if
i
do
it
these
thousands
of
muskets
will
be
turned
against
us
we
should
lose
more
than
we
should
gain
being
still
further
urged
president
lincoln
gave
them
this
answer
gentlemen
he
said
i
cant
do
it
i
cant
see
it
as
you
do
you
may
be
right
and
i
may
be
wrong
but
ill
tell
you
what
i
can
do
i
can
resign
in
favor
of
mr
hamlin
perhaps
mr
hamlin
could
do
it
the
matter
ended
there
for
the
time
being
the
gun
shot
better
the
president
took
a
lively
interest
in
all
new
firearm
improvements
and
inventions
and
it
sometimes
happened
that
when
an
inventor
could
get
nobody
else
in
the
government
to
listen
to
him
the
president
would
personally
test
his
gun
a
former
clerk
in
the
navy
department
tells
an
incident
illustrative
he
had
stayed
late
one
night
at
his
desk
when
he
heard
some
one
striding
up
and
down
the
hall
muttering
i
do
wonder
if
they
have
gone
already
and
left
the
building
all
alone
looking
out
the
clerk
was
surprised
to
see
the
president
good
evening
said
mr
lincoln
i
was
just
looking
for
that
man
who
goes
shooting
with
me
sometimes
the
clerk
knew
mr
lincoln
referred
to
a
certain
messenger
of
the
ordnance
department
who
had
been
accustomed
to
going
with
him
to
test
weapons
but
as
this
man
had
gone
home
the
clerk
offered
his
services
together
they
went
to
the
lawn
south
of
the
white
house
where
mr
lincoln
fixed
up
a
target
cut
from
a
sheet
of
white
congressional
notepaper
then
pacing
off
a
distance
of
about
eighty
or
a
hundred
feet
writes
the
clerk
he
raised
the
rifle
to
a
level
took
a
quick
aim
and
drove
the
round
of
seven
shots
in
quick
succession
the
bullets
shooting
all
around
the
target
like
a
gatling
gun
and
one
striking
near
the
center
i
believe
i
can
make
this
gun
shoot
better
said
mr
lincoln
after
we
had
looked
at
the
result
of
the
first
fire
with
this
he
took
from
his
vest
pocket
a
small
wooden
sight
which
he
had
whittled
from
a
pine
stick
and
adjusted
it
over
the
sight
of
the
carbine
he
then
shot
two
rounds
and
of
the
fourteen
bullets
nearly
a
dozen
hit
the
paper
lenient
with
mcclellan
general
mcclellan
aside
from
his
lack
of
aggressiveness
fretted
the
president
greatly
with
his
complaints
about
military
matters
his
obtrusive
criticism
regarding
political
matters
and
especially
at
his
insulting
declaration
to
the
secretary
of
war
dated
june
th
just
after
his
retreat
to
the
james
river
general
halleck
was
made
commanderinchief
of
the
union
forces
in
july
and
september
st
mcclellan
was
called
to
washington
the
day
before
he
had
written
his
wife
that
as
a
matter
of
selfrespect
i
cannot
go
there
president
lincoln
and
general
halleck
called
at
mcclellans
house
and
the
president
said
as
a
favor
to
me
i
wish
you
would
take
command
of
the
fortifications
of
washington
and
all
the
troops
for
the
defense
of
the
capital
lincoln
thought
highly
of
mcclellans
ability
as
an
organizer
and
his
strength
in
defense
yet
any
other
president
would
have
had
him
courtmartialed
for
using
this
language
which
appeared
in
mcclellans
letter
of
june
th
if
i
save
this
army
now
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
owe
no
thanks
to
you
or
to
any
other
person
in
washington
you
have
done
your
best
to
sacrifice
this
army
this
letter
although
addressed
to
the
secretary
of
war
distinctly
embraced
the
president
in
the
grave
charge
of
conspiracy
to
defeat
mcclellans
army
and
sacrifice
thousands
of
the
lives
of
his
soldiers
didnt
want
a
military
reputation
lincoln
was
averse
to
being
put
up
as
a
military
hero
when
general
cass
was
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
his
friends
sought
to
endow
him
with
a
military
reputation
lincoln
at
that
time
a
representative
in
congress
delivered
a
speech
before
the
house
which
in
its
allusion
to
mr
cass
was
exquisitely
sarcastic
and
irresistibly
humorous
by
the
way
mr
speaker
said
lincoln
do
you
know
i
am
a
military
hero
yes
sir
in
the
days
of
the
black
hawk
war
i
fought
bled
and
came
away
speaking
of
general
casss
career
reminds
me
of
my
own
i
was
not
at
stillmans
defeat
but
i
was
about
as
near
it
as
cass
to
hulls
surrender
and
like
him
i
saw
the
place
very
soon
afterwards
it
is
quite
certain
i
did
not
break
my
sword
for
i
had
none
to
break
but
i
bent
my
musket
pretty
badly
on
one
occasion
if
general
cass
went
in
advance
of
me
picking
whortleberries
i
guess
i
surpassed
him
in
charging
upon
the
wild
onion
if
he
saw
any
live
fighting
indians
it
was
more
than
i
did
but
i
had
a
good
many
bloody
struggles
with
the
mosquitoes
and
although
i
never
fainted
from
loss
of
blood
i
can
truly
say
that
i
was
often
very
hungry
lincoln
concluded
by
saying
that
if
he
ever
turned
democrat
and
should
run
for
the
presidency
he
hoped
they
would
not
make
fun
of
him
by
attempting
to
make
him
a
military
hero
surrender
no
slave
about
march
general
benjamin
f
butler
in
command
at
fortress
monroe
advised
president
lincoln
that
he
had
determined
to
regard
all
slaves
coming
into
his
camps
as
contraband
of
war
and
to
employ
their
labor
under
fair
compensation
and
secretary
of
war
stanton
replied
to
him
in
behalf
of
the
president
approving
his
course
and
saying
you
are
not
to
interfere
between
master
and
slave
on
the
one
hand
nor
surrender
slaves
who
may
come
within
your
lines
this
was
a
significant
milestone
of
progress
to
the
great
end
that
was
thereafter
to
be
reached
conscripting
dead
men
mr
lincoln
being
found
fault
with
for
making
another
call
said
that
if
the
country
required
it
he
would
continue
to
do
so
until
the
matter
stood
as
described
by
a
western
provost
marshal
who
says
i
listened
a
short
time
since
to
a
butternutclad
individual
who
succeeded
in
making
good
his
escape
expatiate
most
eloquently
on
the
rigidness
with
which
the
conscription
was
enforced
south
of
the
tennessee
river
his
response
to
a
question
propounded
by
a
citizen
ran
somewhat
in
this
wise
do
they
conscript
close
over
the
river
stranger
i
should
think
they
did
they
take
every
man
who
hasnt
been
dead
more
than
two
days
if
this
is
correct
the
confederacy
has
at
least
a
ghost
of
a
chance
left
and
of
another
a
methodist
minister
in
kansas
living
on
a
small
salary
who
was
greatly
troubled
to
get
his
quarterly
instalment
he
at
last
told
the
nonpaying
trustees
that
he
must
have
his
money
as
he
was
suffering
for
the
necessaries
of
life
money
replied
the
trustees
you
preach
for
money
we
thought
you
preached
for
the
good
of
souls
souls
responded
the
reverend
i
cant
eat
souls
and
if
i
could
it
would
take
a
thousand
such
as
yours
to
make
a
meal
that
soul
is
the
point
sir
said
the
president
lincolns
rejected
manuscript
on
february
th
president
lincoln
formulated
a
message
to
congress
proposing
the
payment
of
to
the
south
as
compensation
for
slaves
lost
by
emancipation
and
submitted
it
to
his
cabinet
only
to
be
unanimously
rejected
lincoln
sadly
accepted
the
decision
and
filed
away
the
manuscript
message
together
with
this
indorsement
thereon
to
which
his
signature
was
added
february
today
these
papers
which
explain
themselves
were
drawn
up
and
submitted
to
the
cabinet
unanimously
disapproved
by
them
when
the
proposed
message
was
disapproved
lincoln
soberly
asked
how
long
will
the
war
last
to
this
none
could
make
answer
and
he
added
we
are
spending
now
in
carrying
on
the
war
a
day
which
will
amount
to
all
this
money
besides
all
the
lives
lincoln
as
a
story
writer
in
his
youth
mr
lincoln
once
got
an
idea
for
a
thrilling
romantic
story
one
day
in
springfield
he
was
sitting
with
his
feet
on
the
window
sill
chatting
with
an
acquaintance
when
he
suddenly
changed
the
drift
of
the
conversation
by
saying
did
you
ever
write
out
a
story
in
your
mind
i
did
when
i
was
a
little
codger
one
day
a
wagon
with
a
lady
and
two
girls
and
a
man
broke
down
near
us
and
while
they
were
fixing
up
they
cooked
in
our
kitchen
the
woman
had
books
and
read
us
stories
and
they
were
the
first
i
had
ever
heard
i
took
a
great
fancy
to
one
of
the
girls
and
when
they
were
gone
i
thought
of
her
a
great
deal
and
one
day
when
i
was
sitting
out
in
the
sun
by
the
house
i
wrote
out
a
story
in
my
mind
i
thought
i
took
my
fathers
horse
and
followed
the
wagon
and
finally
i
found
it
and
they
were
surprised
to
see
me
i
talked
with
the
girl
and
persuaded
her
to
elope
with
me
and
that
night
i
put
her
on
my
horse
and
we
started
off
across
the
prairie
after
several
hours
we
came
to
a
camp
and
when
we
rode
up
we
found
it
was
the
one
we
had
left
a
few
hours
before
and
went
in
the
next
night
we
tried
again
and
the
same
thing
happenedthe
horse
came
back
to
the
same
place
and
then
we
concluded
that
we
ought
not
to
elope
i
stayed
until
i
had
persuaded
her
father
to
give
her
to
me
i
always
meant
to
write
that
story
out
and
publish
it
and
i
began
once
but
i
concluded
that
it
was
not
much
of
a
story
but
i
think
that
was
the
beginning
of
love
with
me
lincolns
ideas
on
crossing
a
river
when
he
got
to
it
lincolns
reply
to
a
springfield
illinois
clergyman
who
asked
him
what
was
to
be
his
policy
on
the
slavery
question
was
most
apt
well
your
question
is
rather
a
cool
one
but
i
will
answer
it
by
telling
you
a
story
you
know
father
b
the
old
methodist
preacher
and
you
know
fox
river
and
its
freshets
well
once
in
the
presence
of
father
b
a
young
methodist
was
worrying
about
fox
river
and
expressing
fears
that
he
should
be
prevented
from
fulfilling
some
of
his
appointments
by
a
freshet
in
the
river
father
b
checked
him
in
his
gravest
manner
said
he
young
man
i
have
always
made
it
a
rule
in
my
life
not
to
cross
fox
river
till
i
get
to
it
and
said
the
president
i
am
not
going
to
worry
myself
over
the
slavery
question
till
i
get
to
it
a
few
days
afterward
a
methodist
minister
called
on
the
president
and
on
being
presented
to
him
said
simply
mr
president
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
i
think
we
have
got
to
fox
river
lincoln
thanked
the
clergyman
and
laughed
heartily

the
day
of
lincolns
second
nomination
for
the
presidency
he
forgot
all
about
the
republican
national
convention
sitting
at
baltimore
and
wandered
over
to
the
war
department
while
there
a
telegram
came
announcing
the
nomination
of
johnson
as
vicepresident
what
said
lincoln
to
the
operator
do
they
nominate
a
vicepresident
before
they
do
a
president
why
replied
the
astonished
official
have
you
not
heard
of
your
own
nomination
it
was
sent
to
the
white
house
two
hours
ago
it
is
all
right
replied
the
president
i
shall
probably
find
it
on
my
return
them

the
illustrated
newspapers

a
good
deal
of
fun
not
only
with
president
lincoln
but
the
latters
cabinet
officers
and
military
commanders
as
well
it
was
said
by
these
funny
publications
that
the
president
had
set
up
a
guillotine
in
his
backyard
where
all
those
who
offended
were
beheaded
with
both
neatness
and

gentlemen
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
step
out
in
the
backyard
the
hair
and
whiskers
of
secretary
of

stanton
are
ruffled
and
awry
and
his
features
are
not
calm
and
undisturbed
indicating
that
he
has
an
idea
of
whats
the
matter
in
that
backyard
the
countenance
of
the
officer
in
the

of
the

wears
rather
an
anxious

look

do
you
know
the
story
of
william
scott
private
he
was
a
boy
from
a
vermont
farm
there
had
been
a
long
march
and
the
night
succeeding
it
he
had
stood
on
picket
the
next
day
there
had
been
another
long
march
and
that
night
william
scott
had
volunteered
to
stand
guard
in
the
place
of
a
sick
comrade
who
had
been
drawn
for
the
duty
it
was
too
much
for
william
scott
he
was
too
tired
he
had
been
found
sleeping
on
his
beat
the
army
was
at
chain
bridge
it
was
in
a
dangerous
neighborhood
discipline
must
be
kept
william
scott
was
apprehended
tried
by
courtmartial
sentenced
to
be
shot
news
of
the
case
was
carried
to
lincoln
william
scott
was
a
prisoner
in
his
tent
expecting
to
be
shot
next
day
but
the
flaps
of
his
tent
were
parted
and
lincoln
stood
before
him
scott
said
the
president
was
the
kindest
man
i
had
ever
seen
i
knew
him
at
once
by
a
lincoln
medal
i
had
long
worn
i
was
scared
at
first
for
i
had
never
before
talked
with
a
great
man
but
mr
lincoln
was
so
easy
with
me
so
gentle
that
i
soon
forgot
my
fright
he
asked
me
all
about
the
people
at
home
the
neighbors
the
farm
and
where
i
went
to
school
and
who
my
schoolmates
were
then
he
asked
me
about
mother
and
how
she
looked
and
i
was
glad
i
could
take
her
photograph
from
my
bosom
and
show
it
to
him
he
said
how
thankful
i
ought
to
be
that
my
mother
still
lived
and
how
if
he
were
in
my
place
he
would
try
to
make
her
a
proud
mother
and
never
cause
her
a
sorrow
or
a
tear
i
cannot
remember
it
all
but
every
word
was
so
kind
he
had
said
nothing
yet
about
that
dreadful
next
morning
i
thought
it
must
be
that
he
was
so
kindhearted
that
he
didnt
like
to
speak
of
it
but
why
did
he
say
so
much
about
my
mother
and
my
not
causing
her
a
sorrow
or
a
tear
when
i
knew
that
i
must
die
the
next
morning
but
i
supposed
that
was
something
that
would
have
to
go
unexplained
and
so
i
determined
to
brace
up
and
tell
him
that
i
did
not
feel
a
bit
guilty
and
ask
him
wouldnt
he
fix
it
so
that
the
firing
party
would
not
be
from
our
regiment
that
was
going
to
be
the
hardest
of
allto
die
by
the
hands
of
my
comrades
just
as
i
was
going
to
ask
him
this
favor
he
stood
up
and
he
says
to
me
my
boy
stand
up
here
and
look
me
in
the
face
i
did
as
he
bade
me
my
boy
he
said
you
are
not
going
to
be
shot
tomorrow
i
believe
you
when
you
tell
me
that
you
could
not
keep
awake
i
am
going
to
trust
you
and
send
you
back
to
your
regiment
but
i
have
been
put
to
a
good
deal
of
trouble
on
your
account
i
have
had
to
come
up
here
from
washington
when
i
have
got
a
great
deal
to
do
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
are
you
going
to
pay
my
bill
there
was
a
big
lump
in
my
throat
i
could
scarcely
speak
i
had
expected
to
die
you
see
and
had
kind
of
got
used
to
thinking
that
way
to
have
it
all
changed
in
a
minute
but
i
got
it
crowded
down
and
managed
to
say
i
am
grateful
mr
lincoln
i
hope
i
am
as
grateful
as
ever
a
man
can
be
to
you
for
saving
my
life
but
it
comes
upon
me
sudden
and
unexpected
like
i
didnt
lay
out
for
it
at
all
but
there
is
some
way
to
pay
you
and
i
will
find
it
after
a
little
there
is
the
bounty
in
the
savings
bank
i
guess
we
could
borrow
some
money
on
the
mortgage
of
the
farm
there
was
my
pay
was
something
and
if
he
would
wait
until
payday
i
was
sure
the
boys
would
help
so
i
thought
we
could
make
it
up
if
it
wasnt
more
than
five
or
six
hundred
dollars
but
it
is
a
great
deal
more
than
that
he
said
then
i
said
i
didnt
just
see
how
but
i
was
sure
i
would
find
some
wayif
i
lived
then
mr
lincoln
put
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
looked
into
my
face
as
if
he
was
sorry
and
said
my
boy
my
bill
is
a
very
large
one
your
friends
cannot
pay
it
nor
your
bounty
nor
the
farm
nor
all
your
comrades
there
is
only
one
man
in
all
the
world
who
can
pay
it
and
his
name
is
william
scott
if
from
this
day
william
scott
does
his
duty
so
that
if
i
was
there
when
he
comes
to
die
he
can
look
me
in
the
face
as
he
does
now
and
say
i
have
kept
my
promise
and
i
have
done
my
duty
as
a
soldier
then
my
debt
will
be
paid
will
you
make
that
promise
and
try
to
keep
it
the
promise
was
given
thenceforward
there
never
was
such
a
soldier
as
william
scott
this
is
the
record
of
the
end
it
was
after
one
of
the
awful
battles
of
the
peninsula
he
was
shot
all
to
pieces
he
said
boys
i
shall
never
see
another
battle
i
supposed
this
would
be
my
last
i
havent
much
to
say
you
all
know
what
you
can
tell
them
at
home
about
me
i
have
tried
to
do
the
right
thing
if
any
of
you
ever
have
the
chance
i
wish
you
would
tell
president
lincoln
that
i
have
never
forgotten
the
kind
words
he
said
to
me
at
the
chain
bridge
that
i
have
tried
to
be
a
good
soldier
and
true
to
the
flag
that
i
should
have
paid
my
whole
debt
to
him
if
i
had
lived
and
that
now
when
i
know
that
i
am
dying
i
think
of
his
kind
face
and
thank
him
again
because
he
gave
me
the
chance
to
fall
like
a
soldier
in
battle
and
not
like
a
coward
by
the
hands
of
my
comrades
what
wonder
that
secretary
stanton
said
as
he
gazed
upon
the
tall
form
and
kindly
face
as
he
lay
there
smitten
down
by
the
assassins
bullet
there
lies
the
most
perfect
ruler
of
men
who
ever
lived
saved
a
life
one
day
during
the
black
hawk
war
a
poor
old
indian
came
into
the
camp
with
a
paper
of
safe
conduct
from
general
lewis
cass
in
his
possession
the
members
of
lincolns
company
were
greatly
exasperated
by
late
indian
barbarities
among
them
the
horrible
murder
of
a
number
of
women
and
children
and
were
about
to
kill
him
they
said
the
safeconduct
paper
was
a
forgery
and
approached
the
old
savage
with
muskets
cocked
to
shoot
him
lincoln
rushed
forward
struck
up
the
weapons
with
his
hands
and
standing
in
front
of
the
victim
declared
to
the
indian
that
he
should
not
be
killed
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
the
men
could
be
kept
from
their
purpose
but
the
courage
and
firmness
of
lincoln
thwarted
them
lincoln
was
physically
one
of
the
bravest
of
men
as
his
company
discovered
lincoln
played
ball
frank
p
blair
of
chicago
tells
an
incident
showing
mr
lincolns
love
for
children
and
how
thoroughly
he
entered
into
all
of
their
sports
during
the
war
my
grandfather
francis
p
blair
sr
lived
at
silver
springs
north
of
washington
seven
miles
from
the
white
house
it
was
a
magnificent
place
of
four
or
five
hundred
acres
with
an
extensive
lawn
in
the
rear
of
the
house
the
grandchildren
gathered
there
frequently
there
were
eight
or
ten
of
us
our
ages
ranging
from
eight
to
twelve
years
although
i
was
but
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
mr
lincolns
visits
were
of
such
importance
to
us
boys
as
to
leave
a
clear
impression
on
my
memory
he
drove
out
to
the
place
quite
frequently
we
boys
for
hours
at
a
time
played
town
ball
on
the
vast
lawn
and
mr
lincoln
would
join
ardently
in
the
sport
i
remember
vividly
how
he
ran
with
the
children
how
long
were
his
strides
and
how
far
his
coattails
stuck
out
behind
and
how
we
tried
to
hit
him
with
the
ball
as
he
ran
the
bases
he
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
play
as
completely
as
any
of
us
and
we
invariably
hailed
his
coming
with
delight
his
passes
to
richmond
not
honored
a
man
called
upon
the
president
and
solicited
a
pass
for
richmond
well
said
the
president
i
would
be
very
happy
to
oblige
if
my
passes
were
respected
but
the
fact
is
sir
i
have
within
the
past
two
years
given
passes
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
to
go
to
richmond
and
not
one
has
got
there
yet
the
applicant
quietly
and
respectfully
withdrew
on
his
tiptoes
public
hangman
for
the
united
states
a
certain
united
states
senator
who
believed
that
every
man
who
believed
in
secession
should
be
hanged
asked
the
president
what
he
intended
to
do
when
the
war
was
over
reconstruct
the
machinery
of
this
government
quickly
replied
lincoln
you
are
certainly
crazy
was
the
senators
heated
response
you
talk
as
if
treason
was
not
henceforth
to
be
made
odious
but
that
the
traitors
cutthroats
and
authors
of
this
war
should
not
only
go
unpunished
but
receive
encouragement
to
repeat
their
treason
with
impunity
they
should
be
hanged
higher
than
haman
sir
yes
higher
than
any
malefactor
the
world
has
ever
known
the
president
was
entirely
unmoved
but
after
a
moments
pause
put
a
question
which
all
but
drove
his
visitor
insane
now
senator
suppose
that
when
this
hanging
arrangement
has
been
agreed
upon
you
accept
the
post
of
chief
executioner
if
you
will
take
the
office
i
will
make
you
a
brigadier
general
and
public
hangman
for
the
united
states
that
would
just
about
suit
you
wouldnt
it
i
am
a
gentleman
sir
returned
the
senator
and
i
certainly
thought
you
knew
me
better
than
to
believe
me
capable
of
doing
such
dirty
work
you
are
jesting
mr
president
the
president
was
extremely
patient
exhibiting
no
signs
of
ire
and
to
this
bit
of
temper
on
the
part
of
the
senator
responded
you
speak
of
being
a
gentleman
yet
you
forget
that
in
this
free
country
all
men
are
equal
the
vagrant
and
the
gentleman
standing
on
the
same
ground
when
it
comes
to
rights
and
duties
particularly
in
time
of
war
therefore
being
a
gentleman
as
you
claim
and
a
lawabiding
citizen
i
trust
you
are
not
exempt
from
doing
even
the
dirty
work
at
which
your
high
spirit
revolts
this
was
too
much
for
the
senator
who
quitted
the
room
abruptly
and
never
again
showed
his
face
in
the
white
house
while
lincoln
occupied
it
he
wont
bother
me
again
was
the
presidents
remark
as
he
departed
few
but
boisterous
lincoln
was
a
very
quiet
man
and
went
about
his
business
in
a
quiet
way
making
the
least
noise
possible
he
heartily
disliked
those
boisterous
people
who
were
constantly
deluging
him
with
advice
and
shouting
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
whenever
they
appeared
at
the
white
house
these
noisy
people
create
a
great
clamor
said
he
one
day
in
conversation
with
some
personal
friends
and
remind
me
by
the
way
of
a
good
story
i
heard
out
in
illinois
while
i
was
practicing
or
trying
to
practice
some
law
there
i
will
say
though
that
i
practiced
more
law
than
i
ever
got
paid
for
a
fellow
who
lived
just
out
of
town
on
the
bank
of
a
large
marsh
conceived
a
big
idea
in
the
moneymaking
line
he
took
it
to
a
prominent
merchant
and
began
to
develop
his
plans
and
specifications
there
are
at
least
ten
million
frogs
in
that
marsh
near
me
an
ill
just
arrest
a
couple
of
carloads
of
them
and
hand
them
over
to
you
you
can
send
them
to
the
big
cities
and
make
lots
of
money
for
both
of
us
frogs
legs
are
great
delicacies
in
the
big
towns
an
not
very
plentiful
it
wont
take
me
moren
two
or
three
days
to
pick
em
they
make
so
much
noise
my
family
cant
sleep
and
by
this
deal
ill
get
rid
of
a
nuisance
and
gather
in
some
cash
the
merchant
agreed
to
the
proposition
promised
the
fellow
he
would
pay
him
well
for
the
two
carloads
two
days
passed
then
three
and
finally
two
weeks
were
gone
before
the
fellow
showed
up
again
carrying
a
small
basket
he
looked
weary
and
done
up
and
he
wasnt
talkative
a
bit
he
threw
the
basket
on
the
counter
with
the
remark
theres
your
frogs
you
havent
two
carloads
in
that
basket
have
you
inquired
the
merchant
no
was
the
reply
and
there
aint
no
two
carloads
in
all
this
blasted
world
i
thought
you
said
there
were
at
least
ten
millions
of
em
in
that
marsh
near
you
according
to
the
noise
they
made
observed
the
merchant
your
people
couldnt
sleep
because
of
em
well
said
the
fellow
accordin
to
the
noise
they
made
there
was
i
thought
a
hundred
million
of
em
but
when
i
had
waded
and
swum
that
there
marsh
day
and
night
fer
two
blessed
weeks
i
couldnt
harvest
but
six
theres
two
or
three
left
yet
an
the
marsh
is
as
noisy
as
it
uster
be
we
havent
catched
up
on
any
of
our
lost
sleep
yet
now
you
can
have
these
here
six
an
i
wont
charge
you
a
cent
fer
em
you
can
see
by
this
little
yarn
remarked
the
president
that
these
boisterous
people
make
too
much
noise
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
keep
pegging
away
being
asked
one
time
by
an
anxious
visitor
as
to
what
he
would
do
in
certain
contingenciesprovided
the
rebellion
was
not
subdued
after
three
or
four
years
of
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government
oh
replied
the
president
there
is
no
alternative
but
to
keep
pegging
away
beware
of
the
tail
after
the
issue
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
governor
morgan
of
new
york
was
at
the
white
house
one
day
when
the
president
said
i
do
not
agree
with
those
who
say
that
slavery
is
dead
we
are
like
whalers
who
have
been
long
on
a
chasewe
have
at
last
got
the
harpoon
into
the
monster
but
we
must
now
look
how
we
steer
or
with
one
flop
of
his
tail
he
will
yet
send
us
all
into
eternity
lincolns
dream
president
lincoln
was
depicted
as
a
headsman
in
a
cartoon
printed
in
frank
leslies
illustrated
newspaper
on
february
the
title
of
the
picture
being
lincolns
dreams
or
theres
a
good
time
coming
the
cartoon
reproduced
here
represents
on
the
right
the
union
generals
who
had
been
defeated
by
the
confederates
in
battle
and
had
suffered
decapitation
in
consequencemcdowell
who
lost
at
bull
run
mcclellan
who
failed
to
take
richmond
when
within
twelve
miles
of
that
city
and
no
opposition
comparatively
and
burnside
who
was
so
badly
whipped
at
fredericksburg
to
the
left
of
the
block
where
the
president
is
standing
with
the
bloody
axe
in
his
hand
are
shown
the
members

of
state
seward
secretary
of
war
stanton
secretary
of
the
navy
welles
and
otherseach
awaiting
his
turn
this
part
of
the
dream
was
never
realized
however
as
the
president
did
not
decapitate
any
of
his
cabinet
officers
it
was
the
idea
of
the
cartoonist
to
hold
lincoln
up
as
a
man
who
would
not
countenance
failure
upon
the
part
of
subordinates
but
visit
the
severest
punishment
upon
those
commanders
who
did
not
win
victories
after
burnsides
defeat
at
fredericksburg
he
was
relieved
by
hooker
who
suffered
disaster
at
chancellorsville
hooker
was
relieved
by
meade
who
won
at
gettysburg
but
was
refused
promotion
because
he
did
not
follow
up
and
crush
lee
rosecrans
was
all
but
defeated
at
chickamauga
and
gave
way
to
grant
who
of
all
the
union
commanders
had
never
suffered
defeat
grant
was
lincolns
ideal
fighting
man
and
the
old
commander
was
never
superseded
there
was
no
need
of
a
story
dr
hovey
of
dansville
new
york
thought
he
would
call
and
see
the
president
upon
arriving
at
the
white
house
he
found
the
president
on
horseback
ready
for
a
start
approaching
him
he
said
president
lincoln
i
thought
i
would
call
and
see
you
before
leaving
the
city
and
hear
you
tell
a
story
the
president
greeted
him
pleasantly
and
asked
where
he
was
from
from
western
new
york
well
thats
a
good
enough
country
without
stories
replied
the
president
and
off
he
rode
lincoln
a
man
of
simple
habits
lincolns
habits
at
the
white
house
were
as
simple
as
they
were
at
his
old
home
in
illinois
he
never
alluded
to
himself
as
president
or
as
occupying
the
presidency
his
office
he
always
designated
as
the
place
call
me
lincoln
said
he
to
a
friend
mr
president
had
become
so
very
tiresome
to
him
if
you
see
a
newsboy
down
the
street
send
him
up
this
way
said
he
to
a
passenger
as
he
stood
waiting
for
the
morning
news
at
his
gate
friends
cautioned
him
about
exposing
himself
so
openly
in
the
midst
of
enemies
but
he
never
heeded
them
he
frequently
walked
the
streets
at
night
entirely
unprotected
and
felt
any
check
upon
his
movements
a
great
annoyance
he
delighted
to
see
his
familiar
western
friends
and
he
gave
them
always
a
cordial
welcome
he
met
them
on
the
old
footing
and
fell
at
once
into
the
accustomed
habits
of
talk
and
storytelling
an
old
acquaintance
with
his
wife
visited
washington
mr
and
mrs
lincoln
proposed
to
these
friends
a
ride
in
the
presidential
carriage
it
should
be
stated
in
advance
that
the
two
men
had
probably
never
seen
each
other
with
gloves
on
in
their
lives
unless
when
they
were
used
as
protection
from
the
cold
the
question
of
eachlincoln
at
the
white
house
and
his
friend
at
the
hotelwas
whether
he
should
wear
gloves
of
course
the
ladies
urged
gloves
but
lincoln
only
put
his
in
his
pocket
to
be
used
or
not
according
to
the
circumstances
when
the
presidential
party
arrived
at
the
hotel
to
take
in
their
friends
they
found
the
gentleman
overcome
by
his
wifes
persuasions
very
handsomely
gloved
the
moment
he
took
his
seat
he
began
to
draw
off
the
clinging
kids
while
lincoln
began
to
draw
his
on
no
no
no
protested
his
friend
tugging
at
his
gloves
it
is
none
of
my
doings
put
up
your
gloves
mr
lincoln
so
the
two
old
friends
were
on
even
and
easy
terms
and
had
their
ride
after
their
old
fashion
his
last
speech
president
lincoln
was
reading
the
draft
of
a
speech
edward
the
conservative
but
dignified
butler
of
the
white
house
was
seen
struggling
with
tad
and
trying
to
drag
him
back
from
the
window
from
which
was
waving
a
confederate
flag
captured
in
some
fight
and
given
to
the
boy
edward
conquered
and
tad
rushing
to
find
his
father
met
him
coming
forward
to
make
as
it
proved
his
last
speech
the
speech
began
with
these
words
we
meet
this
evening
not
in
sorrow
but
in
gladness
of
heart
having
his
speech
written
in
loose
leaves
and
being
compelled
to
hold
a
candle
in
the
other
hand
he
would
let
the
loose
leaves
drop
to
the
floor
one
by
one
tad
picked
them
up
as
they
fell
and
impatiently
called
for
more
as
they
fell
from
his
fathers
hand
forgot
everything
he
knew
before
president
lincoln
while
entertaining
a
few
select
friends
is
said
to
have
related
the
following
anecdote
of
a
man
who
knew
too
much
he
was
a
careful
painstaking
fellow
who
always
wanted
to
be
absolutely
exact
and
as
a
result
he
frequently
got
the
illwill
of
his
less
careful
superiors
during
the
administration
of
president
jackson
there
was
a
singular
young
gentleman
employed
in
the
public
postoffice
in
washington
his
name
was
g
he
was
from
tennessee
the
son
of
a
widow
a
neighbor
of
the
president
on
which
account
the
old
hero
had
a
kind
feeling
for
him
and
always
got
him
out
of
difficulties
with
some
of
the
higher
officials
to
whom
his
singular
interference
was
distasteful
among
other
things
it
is
said
of
him
that
while
employed
in
the
general
postoffice
on
one
occasion
he
had
to
copy
a
letter
to
major
h
a
high
official
in
answer
to
an
application
made
by
an
old
gentleman
in
virginia
or
pennsylvania
for
the
establishment
of
a
new
postoffice
the
writer
of
the
letter
said
the
application
could
not
be
granted
in
consequence
of
the
applicants
proximity
to
another
office
when
the
letter
came
into
gs
hand
to
copy
being
a
great
stickler
for
plainness
he
altered
proximity
to
nearness
to
major
h
observed
it
and
asked
g
why
he
altered
his
letter
why
replied
g
because
i
dont
think
the
man
would
understand
what
you
mean
by
proximity
well
said
major
h
try
him
put
in
the
proximity
again
in
a
few
days
a
letter
was
received
from
the
applicant
in
which
he
very
indignantly
said
that
his
father
had
fought
for
liberty
in
the
second
war
for
independence
and
he
should
like
to
have
the
name
of
the
scoundrel
who
brought
the
charge
of
proximity
or
anything
else
wrong
against
him
there
said
g
did
i
not
say
so
g
carried
his
improvements
so
far
that
mr
berry
the
postmastergeneral
said
to
him
i
dont
want
you
any
longer
you
know
too
much
poor
g
went
out
but
his
old
friend
got
him
another
place
this
time
gs
ideas
underwent
a
change
he
was
one
day
very
busy
writing
when
a
stranger
called
in
and
asked
him
where
the
patent
office
was
i
dont
know
said
g
can
you
tell
me
where
the
treasury
department
is
said
the
stranger
no
said
g
nor
the
presidents
house
no
the
stranger
finally
asked
him
if
he
knew
where
the
capitol

i

paid
for

good
morning
said
the
stranger
lincoln
believed
in
education
that
every
man
may
receive
at
least
a
moderate
education
and
thereby
be
enabled
to
read
the
histories
of
his
own
and
other
countries
by
which
he
may
duly
appreciate
the
value
of
our
free
institutions
appears
to
be
an
object
of
vital
importance
even
on
this
account
alone
to
say
nothing
of
the
advantages
and
satisfaction
to
be
derived
from
all
being
able
to
read
the
scriptures
and
other
works
both
of
a
religious
and
moral
nature
for
themselves
for
my
part
i
desire
to
see
the
time
when
education
by
its
means
morality
sobriety
enterprise
and
integrity
shall
become
much
more
general
than
at
present
and
should
be
gratified
to
have
it
in
my
power
to
contribute
something
to
the
advancement
of
any
measure
which
might
have
a
tendency
to
accelerate
the
happy
period
lincoln
on
the
dred
scott
decision
in
a
speech
at
springfield
illinois
june
th
lincoln
referred
to
the
decision
of
chief
justice
roger
b
taney
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
dred
scott
case
in
this
manner
the
chief
justice
does
not
directly
assert
but
plainly
assumes
as
a
fact
that
the
public
estimate
of
the
black
man
is
more
favorable
now
than
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
revolution
in
those
days
by
common
consent
the
spread
of
the
black
mans
bondage
in
the
new
countries
was
prohibited
but
now
congress
decides
that
it
will
not
continue
the
prohibition
and
the
supreme
court
decides
that
it
could
not
if
it
would
in
those
days
our
declaration
of
independence
was
held
sacred
by
all
and
thought
to
include
all
but
now
to
aid
in
making
the
bondage
of
the
negro
universal
and
eternal
it
is
assailed
and
sneered
at
and
constructed
and
hawked
at
and
torn
till
if
its
framers
could
rise
from
their
graves
they
could
not
at
all
recognize
it
all
the
powers
of
earth
seem
combining
against
the
slave
mammon
is
after
him
ambition
follows
philosophy
follows
and
the
theology
of
the
day
is
fast
joining
the
cry
lincoln
made
many
notable
speeches
abraham
lincoln
made
many
notable
addresses
and
speeches
during
his
career
previous
to
the
time
of
his
election
to
the
presidency
however
beautiful
in
thought
and
expression
as
they
were
they
were
not
appreciated
by
those
who
heard
and
read
them
until
after
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
the
world
had
come
to
understand
the
man
who
delivered
them
lincoln
had
the
rare
and
valuable
faculty
of
putting
the
most
sublime
feeling
into
his
speeches
and
he
never
found
it
necessary
to
incumber
his
wisest
wittiest
and
most
famous
sayings
with
a
weakening
mass
of
words
he
put
his
thoughts
into
the
simplest
language
so
that
all
might
comprehend
and
he
never
said
anything
which
was
not
full
of
the
deepest
meaning
what
ailed
the
boys
mr
roland
diller
who
was
one
of
mr
lincolns
neighbors
in
springfield
tells
the
following
i
was
called
to
the
door
one
day
by
the
cries
of
children
in
the
street
and
there
was
mr
lincoln
striding
by
with
two
of
his
boys
both
of
whom
were
wailing
aloud
why
mr
lincoln
whats
the
matter
with
the
boys
i
asked
just
whats
the
matter
with
the
whole
world
lincoln
replied
ive
got
three
walnuts
and
each
wants
two
tads
confederate
flag
one
of
the
prettiest
incidents
in
the
closing
days
of
the
civil
war
occurred
when
the
troops
marching
home
again
passed
in
grand
form
if
with
wellworn
uniforms
and
tattered
bunting
before
the
white
house
naturally
an
immense
crowd
had
assembled
on
the
streets
the
lawns
porches
balconies
and
windows
even
those
of
the
executive
mansion
itself
being
crowded
to
excess
a
central
figure
was
that
of
the
president
abraham
lincoln
who
with
bared
head
unfurled
and
waved
our
nations
flag
in
the
midst
of
lusty
cheers
but
suddenly
there
was
an
unexpected
sight
a
small
boy
leaned
forward
and
sent
streaming
to
the
air
the
banner
of
the
boys
in
gray
it
was
an
old
flag
which
had
been
captured
from
the
confederates
and
which
the
urchin
the
presidents
second
son
tad
had
obtained
possession
of
and
considered
an
additional
triumph
to
unfurl
on
this
allimportant
day
vainly
did
the
servant
who
had
followed
him
to
the
window
plead
with
him
to
desist
no
master
tad
pet
of
the
white
house
was
not
to
be
prevented
from
adding
to
the
loyal
demonstration
of
the
hour
to
his
surprise
however
the
crowd
viewed
it
differently
had
it
floated
from
any
other
window
in
the
capital
that
day
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
the
target
of
contempt
and
abuse
but
when
the
president
understanding
what
had
happened
turned
with
a
smile
on
his
grand
plain
face
and
showed
his
approval
by
a
gesture
and
expression
cheer
after
cheer
rent
the
air
called
blessings
on
the
american
women
president
lincoln
attended
a
ladies
fair
for
the
benefit
of
the
union
soldiers
at
washington
march
th
in
his
remarks
he
said
i
appear
to
say
but
a
word
this
extraordinary
war
in
which
we
are
engaged
falls
heavily
upon
all
classes
of
people
but
the
most
heavily
upon
the
soldiers
for
it
has
been
said
all
that
a
man
hath
will
he
give
for
his
life
and
while
all
contribute
of
their
substance
the
soldier
puts
his
life
at
stake
and
often
yields
it
up
in
his
countrys
cause
the
highest
merit
then
is
due
the
soldiers
in
this
extraordinary
war
extraordinary
developments
have
manifested
themselves
such
as
have
not
been
seen
in
former
wars
and
among
these
manifestations
nothing
has
been
more
remarkable
than
these
fairs
for
the
relief
of
suffering
soldiers
and
their
families
and
the
chief
agents
in
these
fairs
are
the
women
of
america
i
am
not
accustomed
to
the
use
of
language
of
eulogy
i
have
never
studied
the
art
of
paying
compliments
to
women
but
i
must
say
that
if
all
that
has
been
said
by
orators
and
poets
since
the
creation
of
the
world
in
praise
of
women
were
applied
to
the
women
of
america
it
would
not
do
them
justice
for
their
conduct
during
the
war
i
will
close
by
saying
god
bless
the
women
of
america
lincolns
order
no
after
the
united
states
had
enlisted
former
negro
slaves
as
soldiers
to
fight
alongside
the
northern
troops
for
the
maintenance
of
the
integrity
of
the
union
so
great
was
the
indignation
of
the
confederate
government
that
president
davis
declared
he
would
not
recognize
blacks
captured
in
battle
and
in
uniform
as
prisoners
of
war
this
meant
that
he
would
have
them
returned
to
their
previous
owners
have
them
flogged
and
fined
for
running
away
from
their
masters
or
even
shot
if
he
felt
like
it
this
attitude
of
the
president
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
led
to
the
promulgation
of
president
lincolns
famous
order
no
which
in
effect
was
a
notification
to
the
commanding
officers
of
the
southern
forces
that
if
negro
prisoners
of
war
were
not
treated
as
such
the
union
commanders
would
retaliate
harpers
weekly

a
clever
cartoon
which
we
reproduce
representing
president
lincoln
holding

by
the
collar
while
old
abe
shouts
the
following
words
of
warning
to
jeff

is
in
pursuit
of
a
terrified
little
negro

mr
lincoln
look
here
jeff

if
you
lay
a
finger
on
that
boy
to
hurt
him
ill
lick
this
ugly
cub
of
yours
within
an
inch
of
his
life
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
confederates
the
negro
soldiers
fought
valiantly
they
were
fearless
when
well
led
obeyed
orders
without
hesitation
were
amenable
to
discipline
and
were
eager
and
anxious
at
all
times
to
do
their
duty
in
battle
they
were
formidable
opponents
and
in
using
the
bayonet
were
the
equal
of
the
best
trained
troops
the
southerners
hated
them
beyond
power
of
expression
talked
to
the
negroes
of
richmond
the
president
walked
through
the
streets
of
richmondwithout
a
guard
except
a
few
seamenin
company
with
his
son
tad
and
admiral
porter
on
april
th
the
day
following
the
evacuation
of
the
city
colored
people
gathered
about
him
on
every
side
eager
to
see
and
thank
their
liberator
mr
lincoln
addressed
the
following
remarks
to
one
of
these
gatherings
my
poor
friends
you
are
freefree
as
air
you
can
cast
off
the
name
of
slave
and
trample
upon
it
it
will
come
to
you
no
more
liberty
is
your
birthright
god
gave
it
to
you
as
he
gave
it
to
others
and
it
is
a
sin
that
you
have
been
deprived
of
it
for
so
many
years
but
you
must
try
to
deserve
this
priceless
boon
let
the
world
see
that
you
merit
it
and
are
able
to
maintain
it
by
your
good
work
dont
let
your
joy
carry
you
into
excesses
learn
the
laws
and
obey
them
obey
gods
commandments
and
thank
him
for
giving
you
liberty
for
to
him
you
owe
all
things
there
now
let
me
pass
on
i
have
but
little
time
to
spare
i
want
to
see
the
capitol
and
must
return
at
once
to
washington
to
secure
to
you
that
liberty
which
you
seem
to
prize
so
highly
abe
added
a
saving
clause
lincoln
fell
in
love
with
miss
mary
s
owens
about
or
so
and
while
she
was
attracted
toward
him
she
was
not
passionately
fond
of
him
lincolns
letter
of
proposal
of
marriage
sent
by
him
to
miss
owens
while
singular
unique
and
decidedly
unconventional
was
certainly
not
very
ardent
he
after
the
fashion
of
the
lawyer
presented
the
matter
very
cautiously
and
pleaded
his
own
cause
then
presented
her
side
of
the
case
advised
her
not
to
do
it
and
agreed
to
abide
by
her
decision
miss
owens
respected
lincoln
but
promptly
rejected
himreally
very
much
to
abes
relief
how
jack
was
done
up
not
far
from
new
salem
illinois
at
a
place
called
clarys
grove
a
gang
of
frontier
ruffians
had
established
headquarters
and
the
champion
wrestler
of
the
grove
was
jack
armstrong
a
bully
of
the
worst
type
learning
that
abraham
was
something
of
a
wrestler
himself
jack
sent
him
a
challenge
at
that
time
and
in
that
community
a
refusal
would
have
resulted
in
social
and
business
ostracism
not
to
mention
the
stigma
of
cowardice
which
would
attach
it
was
a
great
day
for
new
salem
and
the
grove
when
lincoln
and
armstrong
met
settlers
within
a
radius
of
fifty
miles
flocked
to
the
scene
and
the
wagers
laid
were
heavy
and
many
armstrong
proved
a
weakling
in
the
hands
of
the
powerful
kentuckian
and
jacks
adherents
were
about
to
mob
lincoln
when
the
latters
friends
saved
him
from
probable
death
by
rushing
to
the
rescue
angels
couldnt
swear
it
right
the
president
was
once
speaking
about
an
attack
made
on
him
by
the
congressional
committee
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
for
a
certain
alleged
blunder
in
the
southwestthe
matter
involved
being
one
which
had
fallen
directly
under
the
observation
of
the
army
officer
to
whom
he
was
talking
who
possessed
official
evidence
completely
upsetting
all
the
conclusions
of
the
committee
might
it
not
be
well
for
me
queried
the
officer
to
set
this
matter
right
in
a
letter
to
some
paper
stating
the
facts
as
they
actually
transpired
oh
no
replied
the
president
at
least
not
now
if
i
were
to
try
to
read
much
less
answer
all
the
attacks
made
on
me
this
shop
might
as
well
be
closed
for
any
other
business
i
do
the
very
best
i
know
how
the
very
best
i
can
and
i
mean
to
keep
doing
so
until
the
end
if
the
end
brings
me
out
all
right
what
is
said
against
me
wont
amount
to
anything
if
the
end
brings
me
out
wrong
ten
thousand
angels
swearing
i
was
right
would
make
no
difference
must
go
and
go
to
stay
ward
hill
lamon
was
president
lincolns
cerberus
his
watch
dog
guardian
friend
companion
and
confidant
some
days
before
lincolns
departure
for
washington
to
be
inaugurated
he
wrote
to
lamon
at
bloomington
that
he
desired
to
see
him
at
once
he
went
to
springfield
and
lincoln
said
hill
on
the
th
i
go
to
washington
and
i
want
you
to
go
along
with
me
our
friends
have
already
asked
me
to
send
you
as
consul
to
paris
you
know
i
would
cheerfully
give
you
anything
for
which
our
friends
may
ask
or
which
you
may
desire
but
it
looks
as
if
we
might
have
war
in
that
case
i
want
you
with
me
in
fact
i
must
have
you
so
get
yourself
ready
and
come
along
it
will
be
handy
to
have
you
around
if
there
is
to
be
a
fight
i
want
you
to
help
me
to
do
my
share
of
it
as
you
have
done
in
times
past
you
must
go
and
go
to
stay
this
is
lamons
version
of
it
lincoln
wasnt
buying
nominations
to
a
party
who
wished
to
be
empowered
to
negotiate
reward
for
promises
of
influence
in
the
chicago
convention
mr
lincoln
replied
no
gentlemen
i
have
not
asked
the
nomination
and
i
will
not
now
buy
it
with
pledges
if
i
am
nominated
and
elected
i
shall
not
go
into
the
presidency
as
the
tool
of
this
man
or
that
man
or
as
the
property
of
any
factor
or
clique
he
envied
the
soldier
at
the
front
after
some
very
bad
news
had
come
in
from
the
army
in
the
field
lincoln
remarked
to
schuyler
colfax
how
willingly
would
i
exchange
places
today
with
the
soldier
who
sleeps
on
the
ground
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
dont
trust
too
fail
in
the
campaign
of
lincoln
in
reply
to
douglas
speech
wherein
he
spoke
of
confidence
in
providence
replied
let
us
stand
by
our
candidate
general
scott
as
faithfully
as
he
has
always
stood
by
our
country
and
i
much
doubt
if
we
do
not
perceive
a
slight
abatement
of
judge
douglas
confidence
in
providence
as
well
as
the
people
i
suspect
that
confidence
is
not
more
firmly
fixed
with
the
judge
than
it
was
with
the
old
woman
whose
horse
ran
away
with
her
in
a
buggy
she
said
she
trusted
in
providence
till
the
britchen
broke
and
then
she
didnt
know
what
in
airth
to
do
hed
risk
the
dictatorship
lincolns
great
generosity
to
his
leaders
was
shown
when
in
january
he
assigned
fighting
joe
hooker
to
the
command
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
hooker
had
believed
in
a
military
dictatorship
and
it
was
an
open
secret
that
mcclellan
might
have
become
such
had
he
possessed
the
nerve
lincoln
however
was
not
bothered
by
this
prattle
as
he
did
not
think
enough
of
it
to
relieve
mcclellan
of
his
command
the
president
said
to
hooker
i
have
heard
in
such
a
way
as
to
believe
it
of
your
recently
saying
that
both
the
army
and
the
government
needed
a
dictator
of
course
it
was
not
for
this
but
in
spite
of
it
that
i
have
given
you
the
command
only
those
generals
who
gain
success
can
be
dictators
what
i
now
ask
of
you
is
military
success
and
i
will
risk
the
dictatorship
lincoln
also
believed
hooker
had
not
given
cordial
support
to
general
burnside
when
he
was
in
command
of
the
army
in
lincolns
own
peculiarly
plain
language
he
told
hooker
that
he
had
done
a
great
wrong
to
the
country
and
to
a
most
meritorious
and
honorable
brother
officer
major
general
i
reckon
at
one
time
the
president
had
the
appointment
of
a
large
additional
number
of
brigadier
and
major
generals
among
the
immense
number
of
applications
mr
lincoln
came
upon
one
wherein
the
claims
of
a
certain
worthy
not
in
the
service
at
all
for
a
generalship
were
glowingly
set
forth
but
the
applicant
didnt
specify
whether
he
wanted
to
be
brigadier
or
major
general
the
president
observed
this
difficulty
and
solved
it
by
a
lucid
indorsement
the
clerk
on
receiving
the
paper
again
found
written
across
its
back
major
general
i
reckon
a
lincoln
would
see
the
tracks
judge
herndon
lincolns
law
partner
said
that
he
never
saw
lincoln
more
cheerful
than
on
the
day
previous
to
his
departure
from
springfield
for
washington
and
judge
gillespie
who
visited
him
a
few
days
earlier
found
him
in
excellent
spirits
i
told
him
that
i
believed
it
would
do
him
good
to
get
down
to
washington
said
herndon
i
know
it
will
lincoln
replied
i
only
wish
i
could
have
got
there
to
lock
the
door
before
the
horse
was
stolen
but
when
i
get
to
the
spot
i
can
find
the
tracks
abe
gave
her
a
sure
tip
if
all
the
days
lincoln
attended
school
were
added
together
they
would
not
make
a
single
years
time
and
he
never
studied
grammar
or
geography
or
any
of
the
higher
branches
his
first
teacher
in
indiana
was
hazel
dorsey
who
opened
a
school
in
a
log
schoolhouse
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
lincoln
cabin
the
building
had
holes
for
windows
which
were
covered
over
with
greased
paper
to
admit
light
the
roof
was
just
high
enough
for
a
man
to
stand
erect
it
did
not
take
long
to
demonstrate
that
abe
was
superior
to
any
scholar
in
his
class
his
next
teacher
was
andrew
crawford
who
taught
in
the
winter
of
in
the
same
little
schoolhouse
abe
was
an
excellent
speller
and
it
is
said
that
he
liked
to
show
off
his
knowledge
especially
if
he
could
help
out
his
less
fortunate
schoolmates
one
day
the
teacher
gave
out
the
word
defied
a
large
class
was
on
the
floor
but
it
seemed
that
no
one
would
be
able
to
spell
it
the
teacher
declared
he
would
keep
the
whole
class
in
all
day
and
night
if
defied
was
not
spelled
correctly
when
the
word
came
around
to
katy
roby
she
was
standing
where
she
could
see
young
abe
she
started
def
and
while
trying
to
decide
whether
to
spell
the
word
with
an
i
or
a
y
she
noticed
that
abe
had
his
finger
on
his
eye
and
a
smile
on
his
face
and
instantly
took
the
hint
she
spelled
the
word
correctly
and
school
was
dismissed
the
president
had
knowledge
of
him
lincoln
never
forgot
anyone
or
anything
at
one
of
the
afternoon
receptions
at
the
white
house
a
stranger
shook
hands
with
him
and
as
he
did
so
remarked
casually
that
he
was
elected
to
congress
about
the
time
mr
lincolns
term
as
representative
expired
which
happened
many
years
before
yes
said
the
president
you
are
from
mentioning
the
state
i
remember
reading
of
your
election
in
a
newspaper
one
morning
on
a
steamboat
going
down
to
mount
vernon
at
another
time
a
gentleman
addressed
him
saying
i
presume
mr
president
you
have
forgotten
me
no
was
the
prompt
reply
your
name
is
flood
i
saw
you
last
twelve
years
ago
at
naming
the
place
and
the
occasion
i
am
glad
to
see
he
continued
that
the
flood
goes
on
subsequent
to
his
reelection
a
deputation
of
bankers
from
various
sections
were
introduced
one
day
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
after
a
few
moments
of
general
conversation
lincoln
turned
to
one
of
them
and
said
your
district
did
not
give
me
so
strong
a
vote
at
the
last
election
as
it
did
in
i
think
sir
that
you
must
be
mistaken
replied
the
banker
i
have
the
impression
that
your
majority
was
considerably
increased
at
the
last
election
no
rejoined
the
president
you
fell
off
about
six
hundred
votes
then
taking
down
from
the
bookcase
the
official
canvass
of
and
he
referred
to
the
vote
of
the
district
named
and
proved
to
be
quite
right
in
his
assertion
only
half
a
man
as
president
lincoln
arm
in
arm
with
expresident
buchanan
entered
the
capitol
and
passed
into
the
senate
chamber
filled
to
overflowing
with
senators
members
of
the
diplomatic
corps
and
visitors
the
contrast
between
the
two
men
struck
every
observer
mr
buchanan
was
so
withered
and
bowed
with
age
wrote
george
w
julian
of
indiana
who
was
among
the
spectators
that
in
contrast
with
the
towering
form
of
mr
lincoln
he
seemed
little
more
than
half
a
man
grant
congratulated
lincoln
as
soon
as
the
result
of
the
presidential
election
of
was
known
general
grant
telegraphed
from
city
point
his
congratulations
and
added
that
the
election
having
passed
off
quietly
is
a
victory
worth
more
to
the
country
than
a
battle
won
brutus
and
caesar
london
punch
persistently
maintained
throughout
the
war
for
the
union
that
the
question
of
what
to
do
with
the
blacks
was
the
most
bothersome
of
all
the
problems
president
lincoln
had
to
solve
punch
thought
the
rebellion
had
its
origin
in
an
effort
to
determine
whether
there
should
or
should
not
be
slavery
in
the
united
states
and
was
fought
with
this
as
the
main
end

the
ghost
of

which
appeared
in
the
tent
of
the
american
brutus
during
the
dark
hours
of

represented
in
the
shape
of

anything
but
ghostlike

punchs
cartoons
were
decidedly
unfriendly
in
tone
toward
president
lincoln
some
of
them
being
not
only
objectionable
in
the
display
of
bad
taste
but
offensive
and
vulgar
it
is
true
that
after
the
assassination
of
the
president
punch
in
illustrations
paid
marked
and
deserved
tribute
to
the
memory
of
the
great
emancipator
but
it
had
little
that
was
good
to
say
of
him
while
he
was
among
the
living
and
engaged
in
carrying
out
the
great
work
for
which
he
was
destined
to
win
eternal
fame
how
stanton
got
into
the
cabinet
president
lincoln
well
aware
of
stantons
unfriendliness
was
surprised
when
secretary
of
the
treasury
chase
told
him
that
stanton
had
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
arrest
of
the
confederate
commissioners
mason
and
slidell
was
legal
and
justified
by
international
law
the
president
asked
secretary
chase
to
invite
stanton
to
the
white
house
and
stanton
came
mr
lincoln
thanked
him
for
the
opinion
he
had
expressed
and
asked
him
to
put
it
in
writing
stanton
complied
the
president
read
it
carefully
and
after
putting
it
away
astounded
stanton
by
offering
him
the
portfolio
of
war
stanton
was
a
democrat
had
been
one
of
the
presidents
most
persistent
vilifiers
and
could
not
realize
at
first
that
lincoln
meant
what
he
said
he
managed
however
to
say
i
am
both
surprised
and
embarrassed
mr
president
and
would
ask
a
couple
of
days
to
consider
this
most
important
matter
lincoln
fully
understood
what
was
going
on
in
stantons
mind
and
then
said
this
is
a
very
critical
period
in
the
life
of
the
nation
mr
stanton
as
you
are
well
aware
and
i
well
know
you
are
as
much
interested
in
sustaining
the
government
as
myself
or
any
other
man
this
is
no
time
to
consider
mere
party
issues
the
life
of
the
nation
is
in
danger
i
need
the
best
counsellors
around
me
i
have
every
confidence
in
your
judgment
and
have
concluded
to
ask
you
to
become
one
of
my
counsellors
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
war
will
soon
be
vacant
and
i
am
anxious
to
have
you
take
mr
camerons
place
stanton
decided
to
accept
abe
like
his
father
abe
lincolns
father
was
never
at
loss
for
an
answer
an
old
neighbor
of
thomas
lincolnabes
fatherwas
passing
the
lincoln
farm
one
day
when
he
saw
abes
father
grubbing
up
some
hazelnut
bushes
and
said
to
him
why
grandpap
i
thought
you
wanted
to
sell
your
farm
and
so
i
do
he
replied
but
i
aint
goin
to
let
my
farm
know
it
abes
jes
like
his
father
the
old
ones
would
say
no
moon
at
all
one
of
the
most
notable
of
lincolns
law
cases
was
that
in
which
he
defended
william
d
armstrong
charged
with
murder
the
case
was
one
which
was
watched
during
its
progress
with
intense
interest
and
it
had
a
most
dramatic
ending
the
defendant
was
the
son
of
jack
and
hannah
armstrong
the
father
was
dead
but
hannah
who
had
been
very
motherly
and
helpful
to
lincoln
during
his
life
at
new
salem
was
still
living
and
asked
lincoln
to
defend
him
young
armstrong
had
been
a
wild
lad
and
was
often
in
bad
company
the
principal
witness
had
sworn
that
he
saw
young
armstrong
strike
the
fatal
blow
the
moon
being
very
bright
at
the
time
lincoln
brought
forward
the
almanac
which
showed
that
at
the
time
the
murder
was
committed
there
was
no
moon
at
all
in
his
argument
lincolns
speech
was
so
feelingly
made
that
at
its
close
all
the
men
in
the
jurybox
were
in
tears
it
was
just
half
an
hour
when
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
acquittal
lincoln
would
accept
no
fee
except
the
thanks
of
the
anxious
mother
abe
a
superb
mimic
lincolns
reading
in
his
early
days
embraced
a
wide
range
he
was
particularly
fond
of
all
stories
containing
fun
wit
and
humor
and
every
one
of
these
he
came
across
he
learned
by
heart
thus
adding
to
his
personal
store
he
improved
as
a
reciter
and
retailer
of
the
stories
he
had
read
and
heard
and
as
the
reciter
of
tales
of
his
own
invention
and
he
had
ready
and
eager
auditors
judge
herndon
in
his
abraham
lincoln
relates
that
as
a
mimic
lincoln
was
unequalled
an
old
neighbor
said
his
laugh
was
striking
such
awkward
gestures
belonged
to
no
other
man
they
attracted
universal
attention
from
the
old
and
sedate
down
to
the
schoolboy
then
in
a
few
moments
he
was
as
calm
and
thoughtful
as
a
judge
on
the
bench
and
as
ready
to
give
advice
on
the
most
important
matters
fun
and
gravity
grew
on
him
alike
why
he
was
called
honest
abe
during
the
year
lincoln
was
in
denton
offutts
store
at
new
salem
that
gentleman
whose
business
was
somewhat
widely
and
unwisely
spread
about
the
country
ceased
to
prosper
in
his
finances
and
finally
failed
the
store
was
shut
up
the
mill
was
closed
and
abraham
lincoln
was
out
of
business
the
year
had
been
one
of
great
advance
in
many
respects
he
had
made
new
and
valuable
acquaintances
read
many
books
mastered
the
grammar
of
his
own
tongue
won
multitudes
of
friends
and
became
ready
for
a
step
still
further
in
advance
those
who
could
appreciate
brains
respected
him
and
those
whose
ideas
of
a
man
related
to
his
muscles
were
devoted
to
him
it
was
while
he
was
performing
the
work
of
the
store
that
he
acquired
the
sobriquet
of
honest
abea
characterization
he
never
dishonored
and
an
abbreviation
that
he
never
outgrew
he
was

and
the

round
about
abes

on
the
sign
enduring
friendship
and
love
of
old
associations
were
prominent
characteristics
of
president
lincoln
when
about
to
leave
springfield
for
washington
he
went
to
the
dingy
little
law
office
which
had
sheltered
his
saddest
hours
he
sat
down
on
the
couch
and
said
to
his
law
partner
judge
herndon
billy
you
and
i
have
been
together
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
have
never
passed

will
you
let
my
name
stay
on
the
old
sign
until
i
come
back
from
washington
the
tears
started
to
herndons
eyes
he
put
out
his
hand
mr
lincoln
said
he
i
never
will
have
any
other
partner
while
you
live
and
to
the
day
of
assassination
all
the
doings
of
the
firm
were
in
the
name
of
lincoln
herndon
very
homely
at
first
sight
early
in
january
colonel
alex
k
mcclure
of
philadelphia
received
a
telegram
from
presidentelect
lincoln
asking
him
mcclure
to
visit
him
at
springfield
illinois
colonel
mcclure
described
his
disappointment
at
first
sight
of
lincoln
in
these
words
i
went
directly
from
the
depot
to
lincolns
house
and
rang
the
bell
which
was
answered
by
lincoln
himself
opening
the
door
i
doubt
whether
a
wholly
concealed
my
disappointment
at
meeting
him
tall
gaunt
ungainly
ill
clad
with
a
homeliness
of
manner
that
was
unique
in
itself
i
confess
that
my
heart
sank
within
me
as
i
remembered
that
this
was
the
man
chosen
by
a
great
nation
to
become
its
ruler
in
the
gravest
period
of
its
history
i
remember
his
dress
as
if
it
were
but
yesterdaysnuffcolored
and
slouchy
pantaloons
open
black
vest
held
by
a
few
brass
buttons
straight
or
evening
dresscoat
with
tightly
fitting
sleeves
to
exaggerate
his
long
bony
arms
and
all
supplemented
by
an
awkwardness
that
was
uncommon
among
men
of
intelligence
such
was
the
picture
i
met
in
the
person
of
abraham
lincoln
we
sat
down
in
his
plainly
furnished
parlor
and
were
uninterrupted
during
the
nearly
four
hours
that
i
remained
with
him
and
little
by
little
as
his
earnestness
sincerity
and
candor
were
developed
in
conversation
i
forgot
all
the
grotesque
qualities
which
so
confounded
me
when
i
first
greeted
him
the
man
to
trust
if
a
man
is
honest
in
his
mind
said
lincoln
one
day
long
before
he
became
president
you
are
pretty
safe
in
trusting

farmer
and
thought
everything

greatness
he
quite
thoroughly
appreciated

the

wrote
my
paramount
object
is
to
save
the
union
and
not
either
to
save
or
to
destroy
slavery
if
i
could
save
the
union
without
freeing
any
slave
i
would
do
it
if
i
could
save
it
by
freeing
all
the
slaves
i
would
do
it
and
if
i
could
do
it
by
freeing
some
and
leaving
others
alone
i
would
also
do
that
what
i
do
about
slavery
and
the
colored
race
i
do

i

it

the
same
old
rum
one
of
president
lincolns
friends
visiting
at
the
white
house
was
finding
considerable
fault
with
the
constant
agitation
in
congress
of
the
slavery
question
he
remarked
that
after
the
adoption
of
the
emancipation
policy
he
had
hoped
for
something
new
there
was
a
man
down
in
maine
said
the
president
in
reply
who
kept
a
grocery
store
and
a
lot
of
fellows
used
to
loaf
around
for
their
toddy
he
only
gave
em
new
england
rum
and
they
drank
pretty
considerable
of
it
but
after
awhile
they
began
to
get
tired
of
that
and
kept
asking
for
something
newsomething
newall
the
time
well
one
night
when
the
whole
crowd
were
around
the
grocer
brought
out
his
glasses
and
says
he
ive
got
something
new
for
you
to
drink
boys
now
honor
bright
said
they
honor
bright
says
he
and
with
that
he
sets
out
a
jug
thar
says
he
thats
something
new
its
new
england
rum
says
he
now
remarked
the
president
in
conclusion
i
guess
were
a
good
deal
like
that
crowd
and
congress
is
a
good
deal
like
that
storekeeper
saved
lincolns
life
when
mr
lincoln
was
quite
a
small
boy
he
met
with
an
accident
that
almost
cost
him
his
life
he
was
saved
by
austin
gollaher
a
young
playmate
mr
gollaher
lived
to
be
more
than
ninety
years
of
age
and
to
the
day
of
his
death
related
with
great
pride
his
boyhood
association
with
lincoln
yes
mr
gollaher
once
said
the
story
that
i
once
saved
abraham
lincolns
life
is
true
he
and
i
had
been
going
to
school
together
for
a
year
or
more
and
had
become
greatly
attached
to
each
other
then
school
disbanded
on
account
of
there
being
so
few
scholars
and
we
did
not
see
each
other
much
for
a
long
while
one
sunday
my
mother
visited
the
lincolns
and
i
was
taken
along
abe
and
i
played
around
all
day
finally
we
concluded
to
cross
the
creek
to
hunt
for
some
partridges
young
lincoln
had
seen
the
day
before
the
creek
was
swollen
by
a
recent
rain
and
in
crossing
on
the
narrow
footlog
abe
fell
in
neither
of
us
could
swim
i
got
a
long
pole
and
held
it
out
to
abe
who
grabbed
it
then
i
pulled
him
ashore
he
was
almost
dead
and
i
was
badly
scared
i
rolled
and
pounded
him
in
good
earnest
then
i
got
him
by
the
arms
and
shook
him
the
water
meanwhile
pouring
out
of
his
mouth
by
this
means
i
succeeded
in
bringing
him
to
and
he
was
soon
all
right
then
a
new
difficulty
confronted
us
if
our
mothers
discovered
our
wet
clothes
they
would
whip
us
this
we
dreaded
from
experience
and
determined
to
avoid
it
was
june
the
sun
was
very
warm
and
we
soon
dried
our
clothing
by
spreading
it
on
the
rocks
about
us
we
promised
never
to
tell
the
story
and
i
never
did
until
after
lincolns
tragic
end
would
not
recall
a
single
word
in
conversation
with
some
friends
at
the
white
house
on
new
years
evening
president
lincoln
said
concerning
his
emancipation
proclamation
the
signature
looks
a
little
tremulous
for
my
hand
was
tired
but
my
resolution
was
firm
i
told
them
in
september
if
they
did
not
return
to
their
allegiance
and
cease
murdering
our
soldiers
i
would
strike
at
this
pillar
of
their
strength
and
now
the
promise
shall
be
kept
and
not
one
word
of
it
will
i
ever
recall
old
broom
best
after
all
during
the
time
the
enemies
of
general
grant
were
making
their
bitterest
attacks
upon
him
and
demanding
that
the
president
remove
him
from
command
frank
leslies
illustrated
newspaper
of
june
came
out
with
the
cartoon
reproduced
the
text
printed
under
the
picture
was
to
the
following
effect
old
abe
greeley
be
hanged
i
want
no
more
new
brooms
i
begin
to
think
that
the
worst
thing
about
my
old
ones
was
in
not
being
handled
right
the
old
broom
the
president
holds
in
his
right
hand
is
labeled
grant
the
latter
had
captured
fort
donelson
defeated
the
confederates
at
shiloh
iuka
port
gibson
and
other
places
and
had
vicksburg
in
his
iron
grasp
when
the
demand
was
made
that
lincoln
depose
grant
the
president
answered
i
cant
spare
this
man
he
fights
grant
never
lost
a
battle
and
when
he
found
the
enemy
he
always
fought
him
mcclellan
burnside
pope
and
hooker
had
been
found
wanting
so
lincoln
pinned
his
faith
to
grant
as
noted
in
the
cartoon
horace
greeley
editor
of
the
new
york
tribune
thurlow
weed
and
others
wanted
lincoln
to
try
some
other
new
brooms
but
president
lincoln
was
wearied
with
defeats
and
wanted
a
few
victories
to
offset
them
therefore
he
stood
by
grant
who
gave
him
victories
god
with
a
little
g
abraham
lincoln
his
hand
and
pen
he
will
be
good
but
god
knows
when
these
lines
were
found
written
in
young
lincolns
own
hand
at
the
bottom
of
a
page
whereon
he
had
been
ciphering
lincoln
always
wrote
a
clear
regular
fist
in
this
instance
he
evidently
did
not
appreciate
the
sacredness
of
the
name
of
the
deity
when
he
used
a
little
g
lincoln
once
said
he
did
not
remember
the
time
when
he
could
not
write
abes
log
it
was
the
custom
in
sangamon
for
the
menfolks
to
gather
at
noon
and
in
the
evening
when
resting
in
a
convenient
lane
near
the
mill
they
had
rolled
out
a
long
peeled
log
on
which
they
lounged
while
they
whittled
and
talked
lincoln
had
not
been
long
in
sangamon
before
he
joined
this
circle
at
once
he
became
a
favorite
by
his
jokes
and
goodhumor
as
soon
as
he
appeared
at
the
assembly
ground
the
men
would
start
him
to
storytelling
so
irresistibly
droll
were
his
yarns
that
whenever
hed
end
up
in
his
unexpected
way
the
boys
on
the
log
would
whoop
and
roll
off
the
result
of
the
rolling
off
was
to
polish
the
log
like
a
mirror
the
men
recognizing
lincolns
part
in
this
polishing
christened
their
seat
abes
log
long
after
lincoln
had
disappeared
from
sangamon
abes
log
remained
and
until
it
had
rotted
away
people
pointed
it
out
and
repeated
the
droll
stories
of
the
stranger
it
was
a
fine
fizzle
president
lincoln
in
company
with
general
grant
was
inspecting
the
dutch
gap
canal
at
city
point
grant
do
you
know
what
this
reminds
me
of
out
in
springfield
ill
there
was
a
blacksmith
who
not
having
much
to
do
took
a
piece
of
soft
iron
and
attempted
to
weld
it
into
an
agricultural
implement
but
discovered
that
the
iron
would
not
hold
out
then
he
concluded
it
would
make
a
claw
hammer
but
having
too
much
iron
attempted
to
make
an
ax
but
decided
after
working
awhile
that
there
was
not
enough
iron
left
finally
becoming
disgusted
he
filled
the
forge
full
of
coal
and
brought
the
iron
to
a
white
heat
then
with
his
tongs
he
lifted
it
from
the
bed
of
coals
and
thrusting
it
into
a
tub
of
water
near
by
exclaimed
well
if
i
cant
make
anything
else
of
you
i
will
make
a
fizzle
anyhow
i
was
afraid
that
was
about
what
we
had
done
with
the
dutch
gap
canal
said
general
grant
a
teetotaler
when
lincoln
was
in
the
black
hawk
war
as
captain
the
volunteer
soldiers
drank
in
with
delight
the
jests
and
stories
of
the
tall
captain
aesops
fables
were
given
a
new
dress
and
the
tales
of
the
wild
adventures
that
he
had
brought
from
kentucky
and
indiana
were
many
but
his
inspiration
was
never
stimulated
by
recourse
to
the
whisky
jug
when
his
grateful
and
delighted
auditors
pressed
this
on
him
he
had
one
reply
thank
you
i
never
drink
it
not
to
open
shop
there
president
lincoln
was
passing
down
pennsylvania
avenue
in
washington
one
day
when
a
man
came
running
after
him
hailed
him
and
thrust
a
bundle
of
papers
in
his
hands
it
angered
him
not
a
little
and
he
pitched
the
papers
back
saying
im
not
going
to
open
shop
here
we
have
liberty
of
all
kinds
lincoln
delivered
a
remarkable
speech
at
springfield
illinois
when
but
twentyeight
years
of
age
upon
the
liberty
possessed
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
part
he
said
in
the
great
journal
of
things
happening
under
the
sun
we
the
american
people
find
our
account
running
under
date
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
the
christian
era
we
find
ourselves
in
the
peaceful
possession
of
the
fairest
portion
of
the
earth
as
regards
extent
of
territory
fertility
of
soil
and
salubrity
of
climate
we
find
ourselves
under
the
government
of
a
system
of
political
institutions
conducing
more
essentially
to
the
ends
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
than
any
of
which
history
of
former
times
tells
us
we
when
mounting
the
stage
of
existence
found
ourselves
the
legal
inheritors
of
these
fundamental
blessings
we
toiled
not
in
the
acquisition
or
establishment
of
them
they
are
a
legacy
bequeathed
to
us
by
a
once
hardy
brave
and
patriotic
but
now
lamented
and
departed
race
of
ancestors
theirs
was
the
task
and
nobly
did
they
perform
it
to
possess
themselves
us
of
this
goodly
land
to
uprear
upon
its
hills
and
valleys
a
political
edifice
of
liberty
and
equal
rights

by

shall
permit
the
world
to
know
this
task

to
our
fathers
justice
to
ourselves
duty
to
posterityall
imperatively
require
us
faithfully
to
perform
how
then
shall
we
perform
it
at
what
point
shall
we
expect
the
approach
of
danger
shall
we
expect
some
transatlantic
military
giant
to
step
the
ocean
and
crush
us
at
a
blow
never
all
the
armies
of
europe
asia
and

with
all
the
treasures
of

in
their

could
not
by

take
a
drink
from

or
make
a
track
on
the
blue
ridge
in
a
trial
of
a
thousand
years
at
what
point
then
is
this
approach
of
danger
to
be
expected
i
answer
if
ever
it
reach
us
it
must
spring
up
amongst
us
it
cannot
come
from
abroad
if
destruction
be
our
lot
we
must
ourselves
be
its
author
and
finisher
as
a
nation
of
freemen
we
must
live
through
all
time
or
die
by
suicide
i
hope
i
am
not
overwary
but
if
i
am
not
there
is
even
now
something
of
illomen
amongst
us
i
mean
the
increasing
disregard
for
law
which
pervades
the
country
the
disposition
to
substitute
the
wild
and
furious
passions
in
lieu
of
the
sober
judgment
of
courts
and
the
worse
than
savage
mobs
for
the
executive
ministers
of
justice
this
disposition
is
awfully
fearful
in
any
community
and
that
it
now
exists
in
ours
though
grating
to
our
feelings
to
admit
it
it
would
be
a
violation
of
truth
and
an
insult
to
deny
accounts
of
outrages
committed
by
mobs
form
the
everyday
news
of
the
times
they
have
pervaded
the
country
from
new
england
to
louisiana
they
are
neither
peculiar
to
the
eternal
snows
of
the
former
nor
the
burning
sun
of
the
latter
they
are
not
the
creatures
of
climate
neither
are
they
confined
to
the
slaveholding
or
nonslaveholding
states
alike
they
spring
up
among
the
pleasurehunting
southerners
and
the
orderloving
citizens
of
the
land
of
steady
habits
whatever
then
their
cause
may
be
it
is
common
to
the
whole
country
many
great
and
good
men
sufficiently
qualified
for
any
task
they
may
undertake
may
ever
be
found
whose
ambition
would
aspire
to
nothing
beyond
a
seat
in
congress
a
gubernatorial
or
presidential
chair
but
such
belong
not
to
the
family
of
the
lion
or
the
tribe
of
the
eagle
what
think
you
these
places
would
satisfy
an
alexander
a
caesar
or
a
napoleon
never
towering
genius
disdains
a
beaten
path
it
seeks
regions
hitherto
unexplored
it
seeks
no
distinction
in
adding
story
to
story
upon
the
monuments
of
fame
erected
to
the
memory
of
others
it
denies
that
it
is
glory
enough
to
serve
under
any
chief
it
scorns
to
tread
in
the
footpaths
of
any
predecessor
however
illustrious
it
thirsts
and
burns
for
distinction
and
if
possible
it
will
have
it
whether
at
the
expense
of
emancipating
the
slaves
or
enslaving
freemen
another
reason
which
once
was
but
which
to
the
same
extent
is
now
no
more
has
done
much
in
maintaining
our
institutions
thus
far
i
mean
the
powerful
influence
which
the
interesting
scenes
of
the
revolution
had
upon
the
passions
of
the
people
as
distinguished
from
their
judgment
but
these
histories
are
gone
they
can
be
read
no
more
forever
they
were
a
fortress
of
strength
but
what
the
invading
foeman
could
never
do
the
silent
artillery
of
time
has
done
the
levelling
of
the
walls
they
were
a
forest
of
giant
oaks
but
the
allresisting
hurricane
swept
over
them
and
left
only
here
and
there
a
lone
trunk
despoiled
of
its
verdure
shorn
of
its
foliage
unshading
and
unshaded
to
murmur
in
a
few
more
gentle
breezes
and
to
combat
with
its
mutilated
limbs
a
few
more
rude
storms
then
to
sink
and
be
no
more
they
were
the
pillars
of
the
temple
of
liberty
and
now
that
they
have
crumbled
away
that
temple
must
fall
unless
we
the
descendants
supply
the
places
with
pillars
hewn
from
the
same
solid
quarry
of
sober
reason
passion
has
helped
us
but
can
do
so
no
more
it
will
in
future
be

enemy

those

be

into

in
particular
a

latest
story
one
of
mr
lincolns
warm
friends
was
dr
robert
boal
of
lacon
illinois
telling
of
a
visit
he
paid
to
the
white
house
soon
after
mr
lincolns
inauguration
he
said
i
found
him
the
same
lincoln
as
a
struggling
lawyer
and
politician
that
i
did
in
washington
as
president
of
the
united
states
yet
there
was
a
dignity
and
selfpossession
about
him
in
his
high
official
authority
i
paid
him
a
second
call
in
the
evening
he
had
thrown
off
his
reserve
somewhat
and
would
walk
up

he
told
to

on
this

tom
corwin
of
ohio
had
been
down
to
alexandria
va
that
day
and
had
come
back
and
told
lincoln
a
story
which
pleased
him
so
much
that
he
broke
out
in
a
hearty
laugh
and
said
i
must
tell
you
tom
corwins
latest
tom
met
an
old
man
at
alexandria
who
knew
george

and
he
told
tom
that
george
washington
often
swore
now
corwins
father
had
always
held
the
father
of
our
country
up
as
a
faultless
person
and
told
his
son
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
well
said
corwin
when
i
heard
that
george
washington
was
addicted
to
the

and
infirmities

of

little
joke
columbia
go
tell
your
joke
at
springfield
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
was
fought
on
december
th
between
general
burnside
commanding
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
general
lees
force
the
union
troops
time
and
again
assaulted
the
heights
where
the
confederates
had
taken
position
but
were
driven
back
with
frightful
losses
the
enemy
being
behind
breastworks
suffered
comparatively
little
at
the
beginning
of
the
fight
the
confederate
line
was
broken
but
the
result
of
the
engagement
was
disastrous
to
the

cause
burnside
had
one

fiftytwo
killed
nine
thousand
one

and
one
wounded
and
three

two

and
thirtyfour

a
total

seven

general

losses
all
told
were
not
much
more
than
five
thousand
men
burnside
had
succeeded
mcclellan
in
command
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
mainly
it
was
said
through
the
influence
of
secretary
of
war
stanton
three
months
before
mcclellan
had
defeated
lee

the
bloodiest

at

burnside
had
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
at

mcclellan
had
about
eighty
thousand
it
has
been
maintained
that
burnside
should
not
have
fought
this
battle
the
chances
of
success
being
so

school
teacher
crawford
endeavored
to
teach
his
pupils
some
of
the
manners
of
the
polite
society
of
indiana
or
so
this
was
a
part
of
his
system
one
of
the
pupils
would
retire
and
then
come
in
as
a
stranger
and
another
pupil
would
have
to
introduce
him
to
all
the
members
of
the
school
n
what
was
considered
good
manners
as
abe
wore
a
linseywoolsey
shirt
buckskin
breeches
which
were
too
short
and
very
tight
and
low
shoes
and
was
tall
and
awkward
he
no
doubt
created
considerable
merriment
when
his
turn
came
he
was
growing
at
a
fearful
rate
he
was
fifteen
years
of
age
and
two
years
later
attained
his
full
height
of
six
feet
four
inches
had
respect
for
the

early
in
abe
was
one
of
the
guests
of
honor
at
a

he
and
two
others
having
built
the
craft
the
affair
was
a
notable
one
people
being
present
from
the
territory
surrounding
a
large
party
came
from
springfield
with
an
ample
supply
of
whisky
to
give
the
boat
and
its
builders
a
sendoff
it
was
a
sort
of
bipartisan
massmeeting
but
there
was
one
prevailing
spirit
that
born
of
rye
and
corn
speeches
were
made
in
the
best
of
feeling
some
in
favor
of
andrew
jackson
and
some
in
favor
of
henry
clay
abraham
lincoln
the
cook
told
a
number
of
funny
stories
and
it
is
recorded
that
they
were
not
of
too
refined
a
character
to
suit
the
taste
of
his
audience
a
sleightofhand
performer
was
present
and
among
other
tricks
performed
he
fried
some
eggs
in
lincolns
hat
judge
herndon
says
as
explanatory
to
the
delay
in
passing
up
the
hat
for
the
experiment
lincoln
drolly
observed
it
was
out
of
respect
for
the
eggs
not
care
for
my
hat
how
was
the
milk
upset
william
g
greene
an
oldtime
friend
of
lincoln
was
a
student
at
illinois
college
and
one
summer
brought
home
with
him
on
a
vacation
richard
yates
afterwards
governor
of
illinois
and
some
other
boys
and
in
order
to
entertain
them
took
them
up
to
see
lincoln
he
found
him
in
his
usual
position
and
at
his
usual
occupationflat
on
his
back
on
a
cellar
door
reading
a
newspaper
this
was
the
manner
in
which
a
president
of
the
united
states
and
a
governor
of
illinois
became
acquainted
with
each
other
greene
says
lincoln
repeated
the
whole
of
burns
and
a
large
quantity
of
shakespeare
for
the
entertainment
of
the
college
boys
and
in
return
was
invited
to
dine
with
them
on
bread
and
milk
how
he
managed
to
upset
his
bowl
of
milk
is
not
a
matter
of
history
but
the
fact
is
that
he
did
so
as
is
the
further
fact
that
greenes
mother
who
loved
lincoln
tried
to
smooth
over
the
accident
and
relieve
the
young
mans
embarrassment
pulled
fodder
for
a
book
once
abe
borrowed
weems
life
of
washington
from
joseph
crawford
a
neighbor
abe
devoured
it
read
it
and
reread
it
and
when
asleep
put
it
by
him
between
the
logs
of
the
wall
one
night
a
rain
storm
wet
it
through
and
ruined
it
ive
no
money
said
abe
when
reporting
the
disaster
to
crawford
but
ill
work
it
out
all
right
was
crawfords
response
you
pull
fodder
for
three
days
an
the
book
is
yourn
abe
pulled
the
fodder
but
he
never
forgave
crawford
for
putting
so
much
work
upon
him
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
crack
a
joke
at
his
expense
and
the
name
bluenose
crawford
abe
applied
to
him
stuck
to
him
throughout
his
life
praises
his
rival
for
office
when
mr
lincoln
was
a
candidate
for
the
legislature
it
was
the
practice
at
that
date
in
illinois
for
two
rival
candidates
to
travel
over
the
district
together
the
custom
led
to
much
goodnatured
raillery
between
them
and
in
such
contests
lincoln
was
rarely
if
ever
worsted
he
could
even
turn
the
generosity
of
a
rival
to
account
by
his
whimsical
treatment
on
one
occasion
says
mr
weir
a
former
resident
of
sangamon
county
he
had
driven
out
from
springfield
in
company
with
a
political
opponent
to
engage
in
joint
debate
the
carriage
it
seems
belonged
to
his
opponent
in
addressing
the
gathering
of
farmers
that
met
them
lincoln
was
lavish
in
praise
of
the
generosity
of
his
friend
i
am
too
poor
to
own
a
carriage
he
said
but
my
friend
has
generously
invited
me
to
ride
with
him
i
want
you
to
vote
for
me
if
you
will
but
if
not
then
vote
for
my
opponent
for
he
is
a
fine
man
his
extravagant
and
persistent
praise
of
his
opponent
appealed
to
the
sense
of
humor
in
his
rural
audience
to
whom
his
inability
to
own
a
carriage
was
by
no
means
a
disqualification
one
thing
abe
didnt
love
lincoln
admitted
that
he
was
not
particularly
energetic
when
it
came
to
real
hard
work
my
father
said
he
one
day
taught
me
how
to
work
but
not
to
love
it
i
never
did
like
to
work
and
i
dont
deny
it
id
rather
read
tell
stories
crack
jokes
talk
laughanything
but
work
the
modesty
of
genius
the
opening
of
the
year
found
mr
lincolns
name
freely
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
republican
nomination
for
the
presidency
to
be
classed
with
seward
chase
mclean
and
other
celebrities
was
enough
to
stimulate
any
illinois
lawyers
pride
but
in
mr
lincolns
case
if
it
had
any
such
effect
he
was
most
artful
in
concealing
it
now
and
then
some
ardent
friend
an
editor
for
example
would
run
his
name
up
to
the
masthead
but
in
all
cases
he
discouraged
the
attempt
in
regard
to
the
matter
you
spoke
of
he
answered
one
man
who
proposed
his
name
i
beg
you
will
not
give
it
a
further
mention
seriously
i
do
not
think
i
am
fit
for
the
presidency
why
she
married
him
there
was
a
social
at
lincolns
house
in
springfield
and
abe
introduced
his
wife
to
ward
lamon
his
law
partner
lamon
tells
the
story
in
these
words
after
introducing
me
to
mrs
lincoln
he
left
us
in
conversation
i
remarked
to
her
that
her
husband
was
a
great
favorite
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
where
i
had
been
stopping
yes
she
replied
he
is
a
great
favorite
everywhere
he
is
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
some
day
if
i
had
not
thought
so
i
never
would
have
married
him
for
you
can
see
he
is
not
pretty
but
look
at
him
doesnt
he
look
as
if
he
would
make
a
magnificent
president
niagara
falls
written
by
abraham
lincoln
the
following
article
on
niagara
falls
in
mr
lincolns
handwriting
was
found
among
his
papers
after
his
death
niagara
falls
by
what
mysterious
power
is
it
that
millions
and
millions
are
drawn
from
all
parts
of
the
world
to
gaze
upon
niagara
falls
there
is
no
mystery
about
the
thing
itself
every
effect
is
just
as
any
intelligent
man
knowing
the
causes
would
anticipate
without
seeing
it
if
the
water
moving
onward
in
a
great
river
reaches
a
point
where
there
is
a
perpendicular
jog
of
a
hundred
feet
in
descent
in
the
bottom
of
the
river
it
is
plain
the
water
will
have
a
violent
and
continuous
plunge
at
that
point
it
is
also
plain
the
water
thus
plunging
will
foam
and
roar
and
send
up
a
mist
continuously
in
which
last
during
sunshine
there
will
be
perpetual
rainbows
the
mere
physical
of
niagara
falls
is
only
this
yet
this
is
really
a
very
small
part
of
that
worlds
wonder
its
power
to
excite
reflection
and
emotion
is
its
great
charm
the
geologist
will
demonstrate
that
the
plunge
or
fall
was
once
at
lake
ontario
and
has
worn
its
way
back
to
its
present
position
he
will
ascertain
how
fast
it
is
wearing
now
and
so
get
a
basis
for
determining
how
long
it
has
been
wearing
back
from
lake
ontario
and
finally
demonstrate
by
it
that
this
world
is
at
least
fourteen
thousand
years
old
a
philosopher
of
a
slightly
different
turn
will
say
niagara
falls
is
only
the
lip
of
the
basin
out
of
which
pours
all
the
surplus
water
which
rains
down
on
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
square
miles
of
the
earths
surface
he
will
estimate
with
approximate
accuracy
that
five
hundred
thousand
tons
of
water
fall
with
their
full
weight
a
distance
of
a
hundred
feet
each
minutethus
exerting
a
force
equal
to
the
lifting
of
the
same
weight
through
the
same
space
in
the
same
time
but
still
there
is
more
it
calls
up
the
indefinite
past
when
columbus
first
sought
this
continentwhen
christ
suffered
on
the
crosswhen
moses
led
israel
through
the
red
seanay
even
when
adam
first
came
from
the
hand
of
his
maker
then
as
now
niagara
was
roaring
here
the
eyes
of
that
species
of
extinct
giants
whose
bones
fill
the
mounds
of
america
have
gazed
on
niagara
as
ours
do
now
contemporary
with
the
first
race
of
men
and
older
than
the
first
man
niagara
is
strong
and
fresh
today
as
ten
thousand
years
ago
the
mammoth
and
mastodon
so
long
dead
that
fragments
of
their
monstrous
bones
alone
testify
that
they
ever
lived
have
gazed
on
niagarain
that
long
long
time
never
still
for
a
single
moment
never
dried
never
froze
never
slept
never
rested
made
it
hot
for
lincoln
a
lady
relative
who
lived
for
two
years
with
the
lincolns
said
that
mr
lincoln
was
in
the
habit
of
lying
on
the
floor
with
the
back
of
a
chair
for
a
pillow
when
he
read
one
evening
when
in
this
position
in
the
hall
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
front
door
and
although
in
his
shirtsleeves
he
answered
the
call
two
ladies
were
at
the
door
whom
he
invited
into
the
parlor
notifying
them
in
his
open
familiar
way
that
he
would
trot
the
women
folks
out
mrs
lincoln
from
an
adjoining
room
witnessed
the
ladies
entrance
and
overhearing
her
husbands
jocose
expression
her
indignation
was
so
instantaneous
she
made
the
situation
exceedingly
interesting
for
him
and
he
was
glad
to
retreat
from
the
house
he
did
not
return
till
very
late
at
night
and
then
slipped
quietly
in
at
a
rear
door
wouldnt
hold
title
against
him
during
the
rebellion
the
austrian
minister
to
the
united
states
government
introduced
to
the
president
a
count
a
subject
of
the
austrian
government
who
was
desirous
of
obtaining
a
position
in
the
american
army
being
introduced
by
the
accredited
minister
of
austria
he
required
no
further
recommendation
to
secure
the
appointment
but
fearing
that
his
importance
might
not
be
fully
appreciated
by
the
republican
president
the
count
was
particular
in
impressing
the
fact
upon
him
that
he
bore
that
title
and
that
his
family
was
ancient
and
highly
respectable
president
lincoln
listened
with
attention
until
this
unnecessary
commendation
was
mentioned
then
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eye
he
tapped
the
aristocratic
sprig
of
hereditary
nobility
on
the
shoulder
in
the
most
fatherly
way
as
if
the
gentleman
had
made
a
confession
of
some
unfortunate
circumstance
connected
with
his
lineage
for
which
he
was
in
no
way
responsible
and
said
never
mind
you
shall
be
treated
with
just
as
much
consideration
for
all
that
i
will
see
to
it
that
your
bearing
a
title
shant
hurt
you
only
one
life
to
live
a
young
man
living
in
kentucky
had
been
enticed
into
the
rebel
army
after
a
few
months
he
became
disgusted
and
managed
to
make
his
way
back
home
soon
after
his
arrival
the
union
officer
in
command
of
the
military
stationed
in
the
town
had
him
arrested
as
a
rebel
spy
and
after
a
military
trial
he
was
condemned
to
be
hanged
president
lincoln
was
seen
by
one
of
his
friends
from
kentucky
who
explained
his
errand
and
asked
for
mercy
oh
yes
i
understand
some
one
has
been
crying
and
worked
upon
your
feelings
and
you
have
come
here
to
work
on
mine
his
friend
then
went
more
into
detail
and
assured
him
of
his
belief
in
the
truth
of
the
story
after
some
deliberation
mr
lincoln
evidently
scarcely
more
than
half
convinced
but
still
preferring
to
err
on
the
side
of
mercy
replied
if
a
man
had
more
than
one
life
i
think
a
little
hanging
would
not
hurt
this
one
but
after
he
is
once
dead
we
cannot
bring
him
back
no
matter
how
sorry
we
may
be
so
the
boy
shall
be
pardoned
and
a
reprieve
was
given
on
the
spot
couldnt
locate
his
birthplace
while
the
celebrated
artist
hicks
was
engaged
in
painting
mr
lincolns
portrait
just
after
the
formers
first
nomination
for
the
presidency
he
asked
the
great
statesman
if
he
could
point
out
the
precise
spot
where
he
was
born
lincoln
thought
the
matter
over
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
gave
the
artist
the
following
memorandum

after

in

of

out

unmistakable

to

message
congress
at
the
previous
sitting
had
neglected
to
pass
the
resolution
for
the
constitutional
amendment
prohibiting
slavery
but
on
the
st
of
january
the
resolution
was
finally
adopted
and
the
united
states
constitution
soon
had
the
new
feature
as
one
of
its
clauses
the
necessary
number
of
state
legislatures
approving
it
president
lincoln
regarded
the
passage
of
this
resolution
by
congress
as
most
important
as
the
amendment
in
his
mind
covered
whatever
defects
a
rigid
construction
of
the
constitution
might
find
in
his
emancipation
proclamation
after
the
latter
was
issued
negroes
were
allowed
to
enlist
in
the
army
and
they
fought
well
and
bravely
after
the
war
in
the
reorganization
of
the
regular
army
four
regiments
of
colored
men
were
provided
forthe
ninth
and
tenth
cavalry
and
the
twentyfourth
and
twentyfifth

in
the
cartoon
sambo
has
evidently
been
asking
uncle
abe
as
to
the
probability
or
possibility
of
his
being
again
enslaved
when
money
might
be
used
some
lincoln
enthusiast
in
kansas
with
much
more
pretensions
than
power
wrote
him
in
march
proposing
to
furnish
a
lincoln
delegation
from
that
state
to
the
chicago
convention
and
suggesting
that
lincoln
should
pay
the
legitimate
expenses
of
organizing
electing
and
taking
to
the
convention
the
promised
lincoln
delegates
to
this
lincoln
replied
that
in
the
main
the
use
of
money
is
wrong
but
for
certain
objects
in
a
political
contest
the
use
of
some
is
both
right
and
indispensable
and
he
added
if
you
shall
be
appointed
a
delegate
to
chicago
i
will
furnish
to
bear
the
expenses
of
the
trip
he
heard
nothing
further
from
the
kansas
man
until
he
saw
an
announcement
in
the
newspapers
that
kansas
had
elected
delegates
and
instructed
them
for
seward
abe
was
no
beauty
lincolns
military
service
in
the
back
hawk
war
had
increased
his
popularity
at
new
salem
and
he
was
put
up
as
a
candidate
for
the
legislature
a
y
ellis
describes
his
personal
appearance
at
this
time
as
follows
he
wore
a
mixed
jean
coat
clawhammer
style
short
in
the
sleeves
and
bobtailed
in
fact
it
was
so
short
in
the
tail
that
he
could
not
sit
on
it
flax
and
tow
linen
pantaloons
and
a
straw
hat
i
think
he
wore
a
vest
but
do
not
remember
how
it
looked
he
wore
potmetal
boots
hes
just
beautiful
lincolns
great
love
for
children
easily
won
their
confidence
a
little
girl
who
had
been
told
that
the
president
was
very
homely
was
taken
by
her
father
to
see
the
president
at
the
white
house
lincoln
took
her
upon
his
knee
and
chatted
with
her
for
a
moment
in
his
merry
way
when
she
turned
to
her
father
and
exclaimed
oh
pa
he
isnt
ugly
at
all
hes
just
beautiful
big
enough
hog
for
him
to
a
curiosityseeker
who
desired
a
permit
to
pass
the
lines
to
visit
the
field
of
bull
run
after
the
first
battle
lincoln
made
the
following
reply
a
man
in
cortlandt
county
raised
a
porker
of
such
unusual
size
that
strangers
went
out
of
their
way
to
see
it
one
of
them
the
other
day
met
the
old
gentleman
and
inquired
about
the
animal
wall
yes
the
old
fellow
said
ive
got
such
a
critter
mity
big
un
but
i
guess
ill
have
to
charge
you
about
a
shillin
for
lookin
at
him
the
stranger
looked
at
the
old
man
for
a
minute
or
so
pulled
out
the
desired
coin
handed
it
to
him
and
started
to
go
off
hold
on
said
the
other
dont
you
want
to
see
the
hog
no
said
the
stranger
i
have
seen
as
big
a
hog
as
i
want
to
see
and
you
will
find
that
fact
the
case
with
yourself
if
you
should
happen
to
see
a
few
live
rebels
there
as
well
as
dead
ones
abe
offers
a
speech
for
something
to
eat
when
lincolns
special
train
from
springfield
to
washington
reached
the
illinois
state
line
there
was
a
stop
for
dinner
there
was
such
a
crowd
that
lincoln
could
scarcely
reach
the
diningroom
gentlemen
said
he
as
he
surveyed
the
crowd
if
you
will
make
me
a
little
path
so
that
i
can
get
through
and
get
something
to
eat
i
will
make
you
a
speech
when
i
get
back
they
understood
each
other
when
complaints
were
made
to
president
lincoln
by
victims
of
secretary
of
war
stantons
harshness
rudeness
and
refusal
to
be
obligingparticularly
in
cases
where
secretary
stanton
had
refused
to
honor
lincolns
passes
through
the
linesthe
president
would
often
remark
to
this
effect
i
cannot
always
be
sure
that
permits
given
by
me
ought
to
be
granted
there
is
an
understanding
between
myself
and
stanton
that
when
i
send
a
request
to
him
which
cannot
consistently
be
granted
he
is
to
refuse
to
honor
it
this
he
sometimes
does
few
fence
rails
left
there
wont
be
a
tar
barrel
left
in
illinois
tonight
said
senator
stephen
a
douglas
in
washington
to
his
senatorial
friends
who
asked
him
when
the
news
of
the
nomination
of
lincoln
reached
them
who
is
this
man
lincoln
anyhow
douglas
was
right
not
only
the
tar
barrels
but
half
the
fences
of
the
state
of
illinois
went
up
in
the
fire
of
rejoicing
the
great
snow
of
in
explanation
of
lincolns
great
popularity
d
w
bartlett
in
his
life
and
speeches
of
abraham
lincoln
published
in

this
statement
of
abes
efficient
service
to
his
neighbors
in
the
great
snow
of
the
deep
snow
which
occurred
in
was
one
of
the
chief
troubles
endured
by
the
early
settlers
of
central
and
southern
illinois
its
consequences
lasted
through
several
years
the
people
were
illprepared
to
meet
it
as
the
weather
had
been
mild
and
pleasantunprecedentedly
so
up
to
christmaswhen
a
snowstorm
set
in
which
lasted
two
days
something
never
before
known
even
among
the
traditions
of
the
indians
and
never
approached
in
the
weather
of
any
winter
since
the
pioneers
who
came
into
the
state
then
a
territory
in
say
the
average
depth
of
snow
was
never
previous
to
more
than
kneedeep
to
an
ordinary
man
while
it
was
breasthigh
all
that
winter
it
became
crusted
over
so
as
in
some
cases
to
bear
teams
cattle
and
horses
perished
the
winter
wheat
was
killed
the
meager
stock
of
provisions
ran
out
and
during
the
three
months
continuance
of
the
snow
ice
and
continuous
cold
weather
the
most
wealthy
settlers
came
near
starving
while
some
of
the
poor
ones
actually
did
it
was
in
the
midst
of
such
scenes
that
abraham
lincoln
attained
his
majority
and
commenced
his
career
of
bold
and
manly
independence
communication
between
house
and
house
was
often
entirely
obstructed
for
teams
so
that
the
young
and
strong
men
had
to
do
all
the
traveling
on
foot
carrying
from
one
neighbor
what
of
his
store
he
could
spare
to
another
and
bringing
back
in
return
something
of
his
store
sorely
needed
men
living
five
ten
twenty
and
thirty
miles
apart
were
called
neighbors
then
young
lincoln
was
always
ready
to
perform
these
acts
of
humanity
and
was
foremost
in
the
counsels
of
the
settlers
when
their
troubles
seemed
gathering
like
a
thick
cloud
about
them
creditor
paid
debtors
debt
a
certain
rich
man
in
springfield
illinois
sued
a
poor
attorney
for
and
lincoln
was
asked
to
prosecute
the
case
lincoln
urged
the
creditor
to
let
the
matter
drop
adding
you
can
make
nothing
out
of
him
and
it
will
cost
you
a
good
deal
more
than
the
debt
to
bring
suit
the
creditor
was
still
determined
to
have
his
way
and
threatened
to
seek
some
other
attorney
lincoln
then
said
well
if
you
are
determined
that
suit
should
be
brought
i
will
bring
it
but
my
charge
will
be
the
money
was
paid
him
and
peremptory
orders
were
given
that
the
suit
be
brought
that
day
after
the
clients
departure
lincoln
went
out
of
the
office
returning
in
about
an
hour
with
an
amused
look
on
his
face
asked
what
pleased
him
he
replied
i
brought
suit
against
and
then
hunted
him
up
told
him
what
i
had
done
handed
him
half
of
the
and
we
went
over
to
the
squires
office
he
confessed
judgment
and
paid
the
bill
lincoln
added
that
he
didnt
see
any
other
way
to
make
things
satisfactory
for
his
client
as
well
as
the
other
helped
out
the
soldiers
judge
thomas
b
bryan
of
chicago
a
member
of
the
union
defense
committee
during
the
war
related
the
following
concerning
the
original
copy
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
i
asked
mr
lincoln
for
the
original
draft
of
the
proclamation
said
judge
bryan
for
the
benefit
of
our
sanitary
fair
in
he
sent
it
and
accompanied
it
with
a
note
in
which
he
said
i
had
intended
to
keep
this
paper
but
if
it
will
help
the
soldiers
i
give
it
to
you
the
paper
was
put
up
at
auction
and
brought
the
buyer
afterward
sold
it
again
to
friends
of
mr
lincoln
at
a
greatly
advanced
price
and
it
was
placed
in
the
rooms
of
the
chicago
historical
society
where
it
was
burned
in
the
great
fire
of
every
fellow
for
himself
an
elegantly
dressed
young
virginian
assured
lincoln
that
he
had
done
a
great
deal
of
hard
manual
labor
in
his
time
much
amused
at
this
solemn
declaration
lincoln
said
oh
yes
you
virginians
shed
barrels
of
perspiration
while
standing
off
at
a
distance
and
superintending
the
work
your
slaves
do
for
you
it
is
different
with
us
here
it
is
every
fellow
for
himself
or
he
doesnt
get
there
butcherknife
boys
at
the
polls
when
young
lincoln
had
fully
demonstrated
that
he
was
the
champion
wrestler
in
the
country
surrounding
new
salem
the
men
of
de
gang
at
clarys
grove
whose
leader
abe
had
downed
were
his
sworn
political
friends
and
allies
their
work
at
the
polls
was
remarkably
effective
when
the
butcherknife
boys
the
hugepawed
boys
and
the
halfhorsehalfalligator
men
declared
for
a
candidate
the
latter
was
never
defeated
no
second
coming
for
springfield
soon
after
the
opening
of
congress
in
mr
shannon
from
california
made
the
customary
call
at
the
white
house
in
the
conversation
that
ensued
mr
shannon
said
mr
president
i
met
an
old
friend
of
yours
in
california
last
summer
a
mr
campbell
who
had
a
good
deal
to
say
of
your
springfield
life
ah
returned
mr
lincoln
i
am
glad
to
hear
of
him
campbell
used
to
be
a
dry
fellow
in
those
days
he
continued
for
a
time
he
was
secretary
of
state
one
day
during
the
legislative
vacation
a
meek
cadaverouslooking
man
with
a
white
neckcloth
introduced
himself
to
him
at
his
office
and
stating
that
he
had
been
informed
that
mr
c
had
the
letting
of
the
hall
of
representatives
he
wished
to
secure
it
if
possible
for
a
course
of
lectures
he
desired
to
deliver
in
springfield
may
i
ask
said
the
secretary
what
is
to
be
the
subject
of
your
lectures
certainly
was
the
reply
with
a
very
solemn
expression
of
countenance
the
course
i
wish
to
deliver
is
on
the
second
coming
of
our
lord
it
is
of
no
use
said
c
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
not
waste
your
time
in
this
city
it
is
my
private
opinion
that
if
the
lord
has
been
in
springfield
once
he
will
never
come
the
second
time
how
he
won
a
friend
j
s
moulton
of
chicago
a
master
in
chancery
and
influential
in
public
affairs
looked
upon
the
candidacy
of
mr
lincoln
for
president
as
something
in
the
nature
of
a
joke
he
did
not
rate
the
illinois
man
in
the
same
class
with
the
giants
of
the
east
in
fact
he
had
expressed
himself
as
by
no
means
friendly
to
the
lincoln
cause
still
he
had
been
a
good
friend
to
lincoln
and
had
often
met
him
when
the
springfield
lawyer
came
to
chicago
mr
lincoln
heard
of
moultons
attitude
but
did
not
see
moulton
until
after
the
election
when
the
presidentelect
came
to
chicago
and
was
tendered
a
reception
at
one
of
the
big
hotels
moulton
went
up
in
the
line
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
newlyelected
chief
magistrate
purely
as
a
formality
he
explained
to
his
companions
as
moulton
came
along
the
line
mr
lincoln
grasped
moultons
hand
with
his
right
and
with
his
left
took
the
master
of
chancery
by
the
shoulder
and
pulled
him
out
of
the
line
you
dont
belong
in
that
line
moulton
said
mr
lincoln
you
belong
here
by
me
everyone
at
the
reception
was
a
witness
to
the
honoring
of
moulton
from
that
hour
every
faculty
that
moulton
possessed
was
at
the
service
of
the
president
a
little
act
of
kindness
skillfully
bestowed
had
won
him
and
he
stayed
on
to
the
end
never
sued
a
client
if
a
client
did
not
pay
lincoln
did
not
believe
in
suing
for
the
fee
when
a
fee
was
paid
him
his
custom
was
to
divide
the
money
into
two
equal
parts
put
one
part
into
his
pocket
and
the
other
into
an
envelope
labeled
herndons
share
the
lincoln
household
goods
it
is
recorded
that
when
abe
was
born
the
household
goods
of
his
father
consisted
of
a
few
cooking
utensils
a
little
bedding
some
carpenter
tools
and
four
hundred
gallons
of
the
fierce
product
of
the
mountain
still
running
the
machine
one
of
the
cartoonposters
issued
by
the
democratic
national
campaign
committee
in
the
fall
of
is
given
here
it
had
the
legend
running
the
machine
printed
beneath
the
machine
was
secretary
chases
greenback
mill
and
the
mill
was
turning
out
paper
money
by
the
million
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
greedy
contractors
uncle
abe
is
pictured
as
about
to
tell
one
of
his
funny
stories
of
which
the
scene
reminds
him
secretary
of
war
stanton
is
receiving
a
message
from
the
front
describing
a
great
victory
in
which

on

occasion
said
now
mr

those
are
the
facts
and
you
must
see
that

lincoln
replied
in

positive
tone
mr

i
reckon
youll
have
to
execute
the
order
stanton
replied
with
vigor
mr

i
cannot
do
it
this

is
an
improper
one
and
i
cannot
execute
it
lincoln
fixed
his
eyes
upon

and
in
a
firm
voice
and
accent
that
clearly
showed
his
determination
said
mr

it
will
have
to
be
done
it
was
done
rather
starve
than
swindle
ward
lamon
once
lincolns
law
partner
relates
a
story
which
places
lincolns
high
sense
of
honor
in
a
prominent
light
in
a
certain
case
lincoln
and
lamon
being
retained
by
a
gentleman
named
scott
lamon
put
the
fee
at
and
scott
agreed
to
pay
it
says
lamon
scott
expected
a
contest
but
to
his
surprise
the
case
was
tried
inside
of
twenty
minutes
our
success
was
complete
scott
was
satisfied
and
cheerfully
paid
over
the
money
to
me
inside
the
bar
lincoln
looking
on
scott
then
went
out
and
lincoln
asked
what
did
you
charge
that
man
i
told
him
said
he
lamon
that
is
all
wrong
the
service
was
not
worth
that
sum
give
him
back
at
least
half
of
it
i
protested
that
the
fee
was
fixed
in
advance
that
scott
was
perfectly
satisfied
and
had
so
expressed
himself
that
may
be
retorted
lincoln
with
a
look
of
distress
and
of
undisguised
displeasure
but
i
am
not
satisfied
this
is
positively
wrong
go
call
him
back
and
return
half
the
money
at
least
or
i
will
not
receive
one
cent
of
it
for
my
share
i
did
go
and
scott
was
astonished
when
i
handed
back
half
the
fee
this
conversation
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
lawyers
and
the
court
judge
david
davis
then
on
our
circuit
bench
afterwards
associate
justice
on
the
united
states
supreme
bench
called
lincoln
to
him
the
judge
never
could
whisper
but
in
this
instance
he
probably
did
his
best
at
all
events
in
attempting
to
whisper
to
lincoln
he
trumpeted
his
rebuke
in
about
these
words
and
in
rasping
tones
that
could
be
heard
all
over
the
courtroom
lincoln
i
have
been
watching
you
and
lamon
you
are
impoverishing
this
bar
by
your
picayune
charges
of
fees
and
the
lawyers
have
reason
to
complain
of
you
you
are
now
almost
as
poor
as
lazarus
and
if
you
dont
make
people
pay
you
more
for
your
services
you
will
die
as
poor
as
jobs
turkey
judge
o
l
davis
the
leading
lawyer
in
that
part
of
the
state
promptly
applauded
this
malediction
from
the
bench
but
lincoln
was
immovable
that
money
said
he
comes
out
of
the
pocket
of
a
poor
demented
girl
and
i
would
rather
starve
than
swindle
her
in
this
manner
dont
aim
too
high
billy
dont
shoot
too
highaim
lower
and
the
common
people
will
understand
you
lincoln
once
said
to
a
brother
lawyer
they
are
the
ones
you
want
to
reachat
least
they
are
the
ones
you
ought
to
reach
the
educated
and
refined
people
will
understand
you
anyway
if
you
aim
too
high
your
idea
will
go
over
the
heads
of
the
masses
and
only
hit
those
who
need
no
hitting
not
much
at
railsplitting
one
who
afterward
became
one
of
lincolns
most
devoted
friends
and
adherents
tells
this
story
regarding
the
manner
in
which
lincoln
received
him
when
they
met
for
the
first
time
after
a
comical
survey
of
my
fashionable
toggerymy
swallowtail
coat
white
neckcloth
and
ruffled
shirt
an
astonishing
outfit
for
a
young
limb
of
the
law
in
that
settlement
lincoln
said
going
to
try
your
hand
at
the
law
are
you
i
should
know
at
a
glance
that
you
were
a
virginian
but
i
dont
think
you
would
succeed
at
splitting
rails
that
was
my
occupation
at
your
age
and
i
dont
think
i
have
taken
as
much
pleasure
in
anything
else
from
that
day
to
this
gave
the
soldier
the
preference
july
th
lincoln
wrote
the
postmastergeneral
yesterday
little
indorsements
of
mine
went
to
you
in
two
cases
of
postmasterships
sought
for
widows
whose
husbands
have
fallen
in
the
battles
of
this
war
these
cases
occurring
on
the
same
day
brought
me
to
reflect
more
attentively
than
what
i
had
before
done
as
to
what
is
fairly
due
from
us
here
in
dispensing
of
patronage
toward
the
men
who
by
fighting
our
battles
bear
the
chief
burden
of
saving
our
country
my
conclusion
is
that
other
claims
and
qualifications
being
equal
they
have
the
right
and
this
is
especially
applicable
to
the
disabled
soldier
and
the
deceased
soldiers
family
the
president
was
not
scared
when
told
how
uneasy
all
had
been
at
his
going
to
richmond
lincoln
replied
why
if
any
one
else
had
been
president
and
had
gone
to
richmond
i
would
have
been
alarmed
but
i
was
not
scared
about
myself

may
concern
any

which
embraces
the
restoration
of

the

which
comes

and
with

be

by

by

substantial
and
collateral
points

jefferson
davis
replied
we
are
not
fighting
for
slavery
we
are
fighting
for
independence
lincoln
was
a
gentleman
lincoln
was
compelled
to
contend
with
the
results
of
the
illjudged
zeal
of
politicians
who
forced
ahead
his
flatboat
and
railsplitting
record
with
the
homely
surroundings
of
his
earlier
days
and
thus
obscured
for
the
time
the
other
fact
that
always
having
the
heart
he
had
long
since
acquired
the
manners
of
a
true
gentleman
so
too
did
he
suffer
from
eastern
censors
who
did
not
take
those
surroundings
into
account
and
allowed
nothing
for
his
originality
of
character
one
of
these
critics
heard
at
washington
that
mr
lincoln
in
speaking
at
different
times
of
some
move
or
thing
said
it
had
petered
out
that
some
other
ones
plan
wouldnt
gibe
and
being
asked
if
the
war
and
the
cause
of
the
union
were
not
a
great
care
to
him
replied
yes
it
is
a
heavy
hog
to
hold
the
first
two
phrases
are
so
familiar
here
in
the
west
that
they
need
no
explanation
of
the
last
and
more
pioneer
one
it
may
be
said
that
it
had
a
special
force
and
was
peculiarly
lincolnlike
in
the
way
applied
by
him
in
the
early
times
in
illinois
those
having
hogs
did
their
own
killing
assisted
by
their
neighbors
stripped
of
its
hair
one
held
the
carcass
nearly
perpendicular
in
the
air
head
down
while
others
put
one
point
of
the
gambrelbar
through
a
slit
in
its
hock
then
over
the
stringpole
and
the
other
point
through
the
other
hock
and
so
swung
the
animal
clear
of
the
ground
while
all
this
was
being
done
it
took
a
good
man
to
hold
the
hog
greasy
warmly
moist
and
weighing
some
two
hundred
pounds
and
often
those
with
the
gambrel
prolonged
the
strain
being
provokingly
slow
in
hopes
to
make
the
holder
drop
his
burden
this
latter
thought
is
again
expressed
where
president
lincoln
writing
of
the
peace
which
he
hoped
would
come
soon
to
stay
and
so
come
as
to
be
worth
the
keeping
in
all
future
time
added
that
while
there
would
be
some
black
men
who
can
remember
that
with
silent
tongue
and
clenched
teeth
and
steady
eye
and
wellpoised
bayonet
they
have
helped
mankind
on
to
this
great
consummation
he
feared
there
would
be
some
white
ones
unable
to
forget
that
with
malignant
heart
and
deceitful
tongue
they
had
striven
to
hinder
it
he
had
two
seemingly
opposite
elements
little
understood
by
strangers
and
which
those
in
more
intimate
relations
with
him
find
difficult
to
explain
an
open
boyish
tongue
when
in
a
happy
mood
and
with
this
a
reserve
of
power
a
force
of
thought
that
impressed
itself
without
words
on
observers
in
his
presence
with
the
cares
of
the
nation
on
his
mind
he
became
more
meditative
and
lost
much
of
his
lively
ways
remembered
back
in
illinois
his
poor
relations
one
of
the
most
beautiful
traits
of
mr
lincolns
character
was
his
considerate
regard
for
the
poor
and
obscure
relatives
he
had
left
plodding
along
in
their
humble
ways
of
life
wherever
upon
his
circuit
he
found
them
he
always
went
to
their
dwellings
ate
with
them
and
when
convenient
made
their
houses
his
home
he
never
assumed
in
their
presence
the
slightest
superiority
to
them
he
gave
them
money
when
they
needed
it
and
he
had
it
countless
times
he
was
known
to
leave
his
companions
at
the
village
hotel
after
a
hard
days
work
in
the
courtroom
and
spend
the
evening
with
these
old
friends
and
companions
of
his
humbler
days
on
one
occasion
when
urged
not
to
go
he
replied
why
aunts
heart
would
be
broken
if
i
should
leave
town
without
calling
upon
her
yet
he
was
obliged
to
walk
several
miles
to
make
the
call
deserters
sins
washed
out
in
blood
this
was
the
reply
made
by
lincoln
to
an
application
for
the
pardon
of
a
soldier
who
had
shown
himself
brave
in
war
had
been
severely
wounded
but
afterward
deserted
did
you
say
he
was
once
badly
wounded
then
as
the
scriptures
say
that
in
the
shedding
of
blood
is
the
remission
of
sins
i
guess
well
have
to
let
him
off
this
time
sure
cure
for
boils
president
lincoln
and
postmastergeneral
blair
were
talking
of
the
war
blair
said
the
president
did
you
ever
know
that
fright
has
sometimes
proven
a
cure
for
boils
no
mr
president
how
is
that
ill
tell
you
not
long
ago
when
a
colonel
with
his
cavalry
was
at
the
front
and
the
rebs
were
making
things
rather
lively
for
us
the
colonel
was
ordered
out
to
a
reconnaissance
he
was
troubled
at
the
time
with
a
big
boil
where
it
made
horseback
riding
decidedly
uncomfortable
he
finally
dismounted
and
ordered
the
troops
forward
without
him
soon
he
was
startled
by
the
rapid
reports
of
pistols
and
the
helterskelter
approach
of
his
troops
in
full
retreat
before
a
yelling
rebel
force
he
forgot
everything
but
the
yells
sprang
into
his
saddle
and
made
capital
time
over
the
fences
and
ditches
till
safe
within
the
lines
the
pain
from
his
boil
was
gone
and
the
boil
too
and
the
colonel
swore
that
there
was
no
cure
for
boils
so
sure
as
fright
from
rebel
yells
pay
for
everything
when
president
lincoln
issued
a
military
order
it
was
usually
expressive
as
the
following
shows
war
department
washington
july
first
ordered
that
military
commanders
within
the
states
of
virginia
south
carolina
georgia
florida
alabama
mississippi
louisiana
texas
and
arkansas
in
an
orderly
manner
seize
and
use
any
property
real
or
personal
which
may
be
necessary
or
convenient
for
their
several
commands
for
supplies
or
for
other
military
purposes
and
that
while
property
may
be
all
stored
for
proper
military
objects
none
shall
be
destroyed
in
wantonness
or
malice
second
that
military
and
naval
commanders
shall
employ
as
laborers
within
and
from
said
states
so
many
persons
of
african
descent
as
can
be
advantageously
used
for
military
or
naval
purposes
giving
them
reasonable
wages
for
their
labor
third
that
as
to
both
property
and
persons
of
african
descent
accounts
shall
be
kept
sufficiently
accurate
and
in
detail
to
show
quantities
and
amounts
and
from
whom
both
property
and
such
persons
shall
have
come
as
a
basis
upon
which
compensation
can
be
made
in
proper
cases
and
the
several
departments
of
this
government
shall
attend
to
and
perform
their
appropriate
parts
towards
the
execution
of
these
orders
by
order
of
the
president
bashful
with
ladies
judge
david
davis
justice
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
united
states
senator
from
illinois
was
one
of
lincolns
most
intimate
friends
he
told
this
story
on
abe
lincoln
was
very
bashful
when
in
the
presence
of
ladies
i
remember
once
we
were
invited
to
take
tea
at
a
friends
house
and
while
in
the
parlor
i
was
called
to
the
front
gate
to
see
someone
when
i
returned
lincoln
who
had
undertaken
to
entertain
the
ladies
was
twisting
and
squirming
in
his
chair
and
as
bashful
as
a
schoolboy
saw
humor
in
everything
there
was
much
that
was
irritating
and
uncomfortable
in
the
circuitriding
of
the
illinois
court
but
there
was
more
which
was
amusing
to
a
temperament
like
lincolns
the
freedom
the
long
days
in
the
open
air
the
unexpected
if
trivial
adventures
the
meeting
with
wayfarers
and
settlersall
was
an
entertainment
to
him
he
found
humor
and
human
interest
on
the
route
where
his
companions
saw
nothing
but
commonplaces
he
saw
the
ludicrous
in
an
assemblage
of
fowls
says
h
c
whitney
one
of
his
fellowitinerants
in
a
man
spading
his
garden
in
a
clothesline

of
clothes

rash
it
was
in
the
latter
part
of
that
russia
offered
its
friendship
to
the
united
states
and
sent
a
strong
fleet
of
warships
together
with
munitions
of
war
to
this
country
to
be
used
in
any
way
the
president
might
see
fit
russia
was
not
friendly
to
england
and
france
these
nations
having
defeated
her
in
the
crimea
a
few
years
before
as
great
britain
and
the
emperor
of
the
french
were
continually
bothering
him
president
lincoln
used
russias
kindly
feeling
and
action
as
a
means
of
keeping
the
other
two
powers
named
in
a
neutral
state
of

the

no

it
is
a

the
opposite
side
i
once
heard
mr
lincoln
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
reading
from
a
reported
case
some
strong
points
in
favor
of
his
argument
reading
a
little
too
far
and
before
becoming
aware
of
it
plunged
into
an
authority
against
himself
pausing
a
moment
he
drew
up
his
shoulders
in
a
comical
way
and
half
laughing
went
on
there
there
may
it
please
the
court
i
reckon
ive
scratched
up
a
snake
but
as
im
in
for
it
i
guess
ill
read
it
through
then
in
his
most
ingenious
and
matchless
manner
he
went
on
with
his
argument
and
won
his
case
convincing
the
court
that
it
was
not
much
of
a
snake
after
all
lincoln
and
the
show
lincoln
was
fond
of
going
all
by
himself
to
any
little
show
or
concert
he
would
often
slip
away
from
his
fellowlawyers
and
spend
the
entire
evening
at
a
little
magic
lantern
show
intended
for
children
a
traveling
concert
company
was
always
sure
of
drawing
lincoln
a
mrs
hillis
a
member
of
the
newhall
family
and
a
good
singer
was
the
only
woman
who
ever
seemed
to
exhibit
any
liking
for
himso
lincoln
said
he
attended
a
negrominstrel
show
in
chicago
once
where
he
heard
dixie
sung
it
was
entirely
new
and
pleased
him
greatly
mixing
and
mingling
an
eastern
newspaper
writer
told
how
lincoln
after
his
first
nomination
received
callers
the
majority
of
them
at
his
law
office
while
talking
to
two
or
three
gentlemen
and
standing
up
a
very
hard
looking
customer
rolled
in
and
tumbled
into
the
only
vacant
chair
and
the
one
lately
occupied
by
mr
lincoln
mr
lincolns
keen
eye
took
in
the
fact
but
gave
no
evidence
of
the
notice
turning
around
at
last
he
spoke
to
the
odd
specimen
holding
out
his
hand
at
such
a
distance
that
our
friend
had
to
vacate
the
chair
if
he
accepted
the
proffered
shake
mr
lincoln
quietly
resumed
his
chair
it
was
a
small
matter
yet
one
giving
proof
more
positively
than
a
larger
event
of
that
peculiar
way
the
man
has
of
mingling
with
a
mixed
crowd
took
part
of
the
blame
among
the
lawyers
who
traveled
the
circuit
with
lincoln
was
usher
f
linder
whose
daughter
rose
linder
wilkinson
has
left
many
lincoln
reminiscences
one
case
in
which
mr
lincoln
was
interested
concerned
a
member
of
my
own
family
said
mrs
wilkinson
my
brother
dan
in
the
heat
of
a
quarrel
shot
a
young
man
named
ben
boyle
and
was
arrested
my
father
was
seriously
ill
with
inflammatory
rheumatism
at
the
time
and
could
scarcely
move
hand
or
foot
he
certainly
could
not
defend
dan
i
was
his
secretary
and
i
remember
it
was
but
a
day
or
so
after
the
shooting
till
letters
of
sympathy
began
to
pour
in
in
the
first
bundle
which
i
picked
up
there
was
a
big
letter
the
handwriting
on
which
i
recognized
as
that
of
mr
lincoln
the
letter
was
very
sympathetic
i
know
how
you
feel
linder
it
said
i
can
understand
your
anger
as
a
father
added
to
all
the
other
sentiments
but
may
we
not
be
in
a
measure
to
blame
we
have
talked
about
the
defense
of
criminals
before
our
children
about
our
success
in
defending
them
have
left
the
impression
that
the
greater
the
crime
the
greater
the
triumph
of
securing
an
acquittal
dan
knows
your
success
as
a
criminal
lawyer
and
he
depends
on
you
little
knowing
that
of
all
cases
you
would
be
of
least
value
in
this
he
concluded
by
offering
his
services
an
offer
which
touched
my
father
to
tears
mr
lincoln
tried
to
have
dan
released
on
bail
but
ben
boyles
family
and
friends
declared
the
wounded
man
would
die
and
feeling
had
grown
so
bitter
that
the
judge
would
not
grant
any
bail
so
the
case
was
changed
to
marshall
county
but
as
ben
finally
recovered
it
was
dismissed
thought
of
learning
a
trade
lincoln
at
one
time
thought
seriously
of
learning
the
blacksmiths
trade
he
was
without
means
and
felt
the
immediate
necessity
of
undertaking
some
business
that
would
give
him
bread
while
entertaining
this
project
an
event
occurred
which
in
his
undetermined
state
of
mind
seemed
to
open
a
way
to
success
in
another
quarter
reuben
radford
keeper
of
a
small
store
in
the
village
of
new
salem
had
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
clary
grove
boys
who
exercised
their
regulating
prerogatives
by
irregularly
breaking
his
windows
william
g
greene
a
friend
of
young
lincoln
riding
by
radfords
store
soon
afterward
was
hailed
by
him
and
told
that
he
intended
to
sell
out
mr
greene
went
into
the
store
and
offered
him
at
random
for
his
stock
which
offer
was
immediately
accepted
lincoln
happened
in
the
next
day
and
being
familiar
with
the
value
of
the
goods
mr
greene
proposed
to
him
to
take
an
inventory
of
the
stock
to
see
what
sort
of
a
bargain
he
had
made
this
he
did
and
it
was
found
that
the
goods
were
worth
lincoln
then
made
an
offer
of
for
his
bargain
with
the
proposition
that
he
and
a
man
named
berry
as
his
partner
take
over
greenes
notes
given
to
radford
mr
greene
agreed
to
the
arrangement
but
radford
declined
it
except
on
condition
that
greene
would
be
their
security
greene
at
last
assented
lincoln
was
not
afraid
of
the
clary
grove
boys
on
the
contrary
they
had
been
his
most
ardent
friends
since
the
time
he
thrashed
jack
armstrong
champion
bully
of
the
grovebut
their
custom
was
not
heavy
the
business
soon
became
a
wreck
greene
had
to
not
only
assist
in
closing
it
up
but
pay
radfords
notes
as
well
lincoln
afterwards
spoke
of
these
notes
which
he
finally
made
good
to
greene
as
the
national
debt
lincoln
defends
fifteen
mrs
nations
when
lincolns
sympathies
were
enlisted
in
any
cause
he
worked
like
a
giant
to
win
at
one
time
about
he
was
in
attendance
upon
court
at
the
little
town
of
clinton
ill
and
one
of
the
cases
on
the
docket
was
where
fifteen
women
from
a
neighboring
village
were
defendants
they
having
been
indicted
for
trespass
their
offense
as
duly
set
forth
in
the
indictment
was
that
of
swooping
down
upon
one
tanner
the
keeper
of
a
saloon
in
the
village
and
knocking
in
the
heads
of
his
barrels
lincoln
was
not
employed
in
the
case
but
sat
watching
the
trial
as
it
proceeded
in
defending
the
ladies
their
attorney
seemed
to
evince
a
little
want
of
tact
and
this
prompted
one
of
the
former
to
invite
mr
lincoln
to
add
a
few
words
to
the
jury
if
he
thought
he
could
aid
their
cause
he
was
too
gallant
to
refuse
and
their
attorney
having
consented
he
made
use
of
the
following
argument
in
this
case
i
would
change
the
order
of
indictment
and
have
it
read
the
state
vs
mr
whiskey
instead
of
the
state
vs
the
ladies
and
touching
these
there
are
three
laws
the
law
of
selfprotection
the
law
of
the
land
or
statute
law
and
the
moral
law
or
law
of
god
first
the
law
of
selfprotection
is
a
law
of
necessity
as
evinced
by
our
forefathers
in
casting
the
tea
overboard
and
asserting
their
right
to
the
pursuit
of
life
liberty
and
happiness
in
this
case
it
is
the
only
defense
the
ladies
have
for
tanner
neither
feared
god
nor
regarded
man
second
the
law
of
the
land
or
statute
law
and
tanner
is
recreant
to
both
third
the
moral
law
or
law
of
god
and
this
is
probably
a
law
for
the
violation
of
which
the
jury
can
fix
no
punishment
lincoln
gave
some
of
his
own
observations
on
the
ruinous
effects
of
whiskey
in
society
and
demanded
its
early
suppression
after
he
had
concluded
the
court
without
awaiting
the
return
of
the
jury
dismissed
the
ladies
saying
ladies
go
home
i
will
require
no
bond
of
you
and
if
any
fine
is
ever
wanted
of
you
we
will
let
you
know
avoided
even
appearance
of
evil
frank
w
tracy
president
of
the
first
national
bank
of
springfield
tells
a
story
illustrative
of
two
traits
in
mr
lincolns
character
shortly
after
the
national
banking
law
went
into
effect
the
first
national
of
springield
was
chartered
and
mr
tracy
wrote
to
mr
lincoln
with
whom
he
was
well
acquainted
in
a
business
way
and
tendered
him
an
opportunity
to
subscribe
for
some
of
the
stock
in
reply
to
the
kindly
offer
mr
lincoln
wrote
thanking
mr
tracy
but
at
the
same
time
declining
to
subscribe
he
said
he
recognized
that
stock
in
a
good
national
bank
would
be
a
good
thing
to
hold
but
he
did
not
feel
that
he
ought
as
president
profit
from
a
law
which
had
been
passed
under
his
administration
he
seemed
to
wish
to
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
evil
said
mr
tracy
in
telling
of
the
incident
and
so
the
act
proved
both
his
unvarying
probity
and
his
unfailing
policy
war
didnt
admit
of
holidays
lincoln
wrote
a
letter
on
october
d
in
which
he
observed
i
sincerely
wish
war
was
a
pleasanter
and
easier
business
than
it
is
but
it
does
not
admit
of
holidays
neutrality
old
john
bull
got
himself
into
a
precious
fine
scrape
when
he
went
so
far
as
to
play
double
with
the
north
as
well
as
the
south
during
the
great
american
civil
war
in
its
issue
of
november
th
london
punch
printed
a
rather
clever
cartoon
illustrating
the
predicament
bull
had
created
for
himself
john
is
being
lectured
by
mrs
north
and
mrs
southboth
good
talkers
and
eminently
able
to
hold
their
own
in
either
social
conversation
parliamentary
debate
or
political
argumentbut
he
bears
it
with
the
best
grace
possible
this
is
the
way
the
text
underneath
the
picture
runs
mrs
north
how
about
the
alabama
you
wicked
old
man
mrs
south
wheres
my
rams
take
back
your
precious
consolsthere
punch
had
a
good
deal
of
fun
with
old
john
before
it
was
through
with
him
but
as
the
confederate
privateer
alabama
was
sent
beneath
the
waves
of
the
ocean
at
cherbourg
by
the
kearsarge
and
mrs
south
had
no
need
for
any
more
rams
john
got
out
of
the
difficulty
without
personal
injury
it
was
a
tight
squeeze
though
for
mrs
north
was
in
a
fighting
humor
and
prepared
to
scratch
or
pull
hair
the
fact
that
the
privateer
alabama
built
at
an
english
shipyard
and
manned
almost
entirely
by
english
sailors
had
managed
to
do
about
worth
of
damage
to
united
states
commerce
was
enough
to
make
any
one
angry
days
of
gladness
past
after
the
war
was
well
on
a
patriot
woman
of
the
west
urged
president
lincoln
to
make
hospitals
at
the
north
where
the
sick
from
the
army
of
the
mississippi
could
revive
in
a
more
bracing
air
among
other
reasons
she
said
feelingly
if
you
grant
my
petition
you
will
be
glad
as
long
as
you
live
with
a
look
of
sadness
impossible
to
describe
the
president
said
i
shall
never
be
glad
any
more
wouldnt
take
the
money
lincoln
always
regarded
himself
as
the
friend
and
protector
of
unfortunate
clients
and
such
he
would
never
press
for
pay
for
his
services
a
client
named
cogdal
was
unfortunate
in
business
and
gave
a
note
in
settlement
of
legal
fees
soon
afterward
he
met
with
an
accident
by
which
he
lost
a
hand
meeting
lincoln
some
time
after
on
the
steps
of
the
statehouse
the
kind
lawyer
asked
him
how
he
was
getting
along
badly
enough
replied
cogdal
i
am
both
broken
up
in
business
and
crippled
then
he
added
i
have
been
thinking
about
that
note
of
yours
lincoln
who
had
probably
known
all
about
cogdals
troubles
and
had
prepared
himself
for
the
meeting
took
out
his
pocketbook
and
saying
with
a
laugh
well
you
neednt
think
any
more
about
it
handed
him
the
note
cogdal
protesting
lincoln
said
even
if
you
had
the
money
i
would
not
take
it
and
hurried
away
grant

on
all
the

with
a

grip
chewed
the
cud
in
solitude
as
a
student
if
such
a
term
could
be
applied
to
lincoln
one
who
did
not
know
him
might
have
called
him
indolent
he
would
pick
up
a
book
and
run
rapidly
over
the
pages
pausing
here
and
there
at
the
end
of
an
hournever
more
than
two
or
three
hourshe
would
close
the
book
stretch
himself
out
on
the
office
lounge
and
then
with
hands
under
his
head
and
eyes
shut
would

governor
richard
yates
he
was
elected
governor
of
illinois
in
when
lincoln
was

told
a
good
story
at
springfield
ill
about
lincoln
one
day
the
latter
was
in
the
sangamon
river
with
his
trousers
rolled
up
five
feetmore
or
lesstrying
to
pilot
a
flatboat
over
a
milldam
the
boat
was
so
full
of
water
that
it
was
hard
to
manage
lincoln
got
the
prow
over
and
then
instead
of
waiting
to
bail
the
water
out
bored
a
hole
through
the
projecting
part
and
let
it
run
out
affording
a
forcible
illustration
of
the
ready
ingenuity
of
the
future
president
lincoln
paid
homage
to
washington
the
martyr
president
thus
spoke
of
washington
in
the
course
of
an
address
washington
is
the
mightiest
name
on
earthlong
since
the
mightiest
in
the
cause
of
civil
liberty
still
mightiest
in

on
that
name
a
eulogy

it
cannot
be
to
add
brightness
to
the
sun
or
glory
to
the
name
of
washington
is
alike
impossible
let
none
attempt
it
in
solemn
awe
pronounce
the
name
and
in
its
naked
deathless
splendor
leave
it
shining
on
stirred
even
the
reporters
lincolns
influence
upon
his
audiences
was
wonderful
he
could
sway
people
at
will
and
nothing
better
illustrates
his
extraordinary
power
than
he
manner
in
which
he
stirred
up
the
newspaper
reporters
by
his
bloomingon
speech
joseph
medill
editor
of
the
chicago
tribune
told
the
story
it
was
my
journalistic
duty
though
a
delegate
to
the
convention
to
make
a
longhand
report
of
the
speeches
delivered
for
the
tribune
i
did
make
a
few
paragraphs
of
what
lincoln
said
in
the
first
eight
or
ten
minutes
but
i
became
so
absorbed
in
his
magnetic
oratory
that
i
forgot
myself
and
ceased
to
take
notes
and
joined
with
the
convention
in
cheering
and
stamping
and
clapping
to
the
end
of
his
speech
i
well
remember
that
after
lincoln
sat
down
and
calm
had
succeeded
the
tempest
i
waked
out
of
a
sort
of
hypnotic
trance
and
then
thought
of
my
report
for
the
paper
there
was
nothing
written
but
an
abbreviated
introduction
it
was
some
sort
of
satisfaction
to
find
that
i
had
not
been
scooped
as
all
the
newspaper
men
present
had
been
equally
carried
away
by
the
excitement
caused
by
the
wonderful
oration
and
had
made
no
report
or
sketch
of
the
speech
when
abe
came
in
when
abe
was
fourteen
years
of
age
john
hanks
journeyed
from
kentucky
to
indiana
and
lived
with
the
lincolns
he
described
abes
habits
thus
when
lincoln
and
i
returned
to
the
house
from
work
he
would
go
to
the
cupboard
snatch
a
piece
of
cornbread
take
down
a
book
sit
down
on
a
chair
cock
his
legs
up

high
as

eternal
fidelity
to
the
cause
of

during
the
harrison
presidential
campaign
of
lincoln
said
in
a
speech
at
springfield
illinois
many
free
countries
have
lost
their
liberty
and
ours
may
lose
hers
but
if
she
shall
be
it
my
proudest
plume
not
that
i
was
last
to
desert
but
that
i
never
deserted
her

that

great
volcano
at
washington
aroused
and
directed
by
the
evil
spirit
that
reigns
there
is
belching
forth
the
lava
of
political
corruption
in
a
current
broad
and
deep
which
is
sweeping
with
frightful
velocity
over
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
bidding
fair
to
leave
unscathed
no
green
spot
or
living
thing
i
cannot
deny
that
all
may
be
swept
away
broken
by
it
i
too
may
be
bow
to
it
i
never
will
the
possibility
that
we
may
fail
in
the
struggle
ought
not
to
deter
us
from
the
support
of
a
cause
which
we
believe
to
be
just
it
shall
never
deter
me
if
ever
i
feel
the
soul
within
me
elevate
and
expand
to
those
dimensions
not
wholly
unworthy
of
its
almighty
architect
it
is
when
i
contemplate
the
cause
of
my
country
deserted
by
all
the
world
beside
and
i
standing
up
boldly
alone
and
hurling
defiance
at
her
victorious
oppressors
here
without
contemplating
consequences
before
heaven
and
in
the
face
of
the
world
i
swear
eternal
fidelity
to
the
just
cause
as
i
deem
it
of
the
land
of
my
life
my
liberty
and
my
love
and
who
that
thinks
with
me
will
not
fearlessly
adopt
the
oath
that
i
take
let
none
falter
who
thinks
he
is
right
and
we
may
succeed
but
if
after
all
we
shall
fail
be
it
so
we
have
the
proud
consolation
of
saying
to
our
consciences
and
to
the
departed
shade
of
our
countrys
freedom
that
the
cause
approved
of
our
judgment
and
adorned
of
our
hearts
in
disaster
in
chains
in
death
we
never
faltered
in
defending
abes
defalcations
lincoln
could
not
rest
for
as
instant
under
the
consciousness
that
even
unwittingly
he
had
defrauded
anybody
on
one
occasion
while
clerking
in
offutts
store
at
new
salem
he
sold
a
woman
a
little
bale
of
goods
amounting
by
the
reckoning
to
he
received
the
money
and
the
woman
went
away
on
adding
the
items
of
the
bill
again
to
make
himself
sure
of
correctness
he
found
that
he
had
taken
six
and
a
quarter
cents
too
much
it
was
night
and
closing
and
locking
the
store
he
started
out
on
foot
a
distance
of
two
or
three
miles
for
the
house
of
his
defrauded
customer
and
delivering
to
her
the
sum
whose
possession
had
so
much
troubled
him
went
home
satisfied
on
another
occasion
just
as
he
was
closing
the
store
for
the
night
a
woman
entered
and
asked
for
half
a
pound
of
tea
the
tea
was
weighed
out
and
paid
for
and
the
store
was
left
for
the
night
the
next
morning
lincoln
when
about
to
begin
the
duties
of
the
day
discovered
a
fourounce
weight
on
the
scales
he
saw
at
once
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
shutting
the
store
he
took
a
long
walk
before
breakfast
to
deliver
the
remainder
of
the
tea
these
are
very
humble
incidents
but
they
illustrate
the
mans
perfect
conscientiousnesshis
sensitive
honestybetter
perhaps
than
they
would
if
they
were
of
greater
moment
he
wasnt
guileless
leonard
swett
of
chicago
whose
counsels
were
doubtless
among
the
most
welcome
to
lincoln
in
summing
up
lincolns
character
said
from
the
commencement
of
his
life
to
its
close
i
have
sometimes
doubted
whether
he
ever
asked
anybodys
advice
about
anything
he
would
listen
to
everybody
he
would
hear
everybody
but
he
rarely
if
ever
asked
for
opinions
as
a
politician
and
as
president
he
arrived
at
all
his
conclusions
from
his
own
reflections
and
when
his
conclusions
were
once
formed
he
never
doubted
but
what
they
were
right
one
great
public
mistake
of
his
lincolns
character
as
generally
received
and
acquiesced
in
is
that
he
is
considered
by
the
people
of
this
country
as
a
frank
guileless
and
unsophisticated
man
there
never
was
a
greater
mistake
beneath
a
smooth
surface
of
candor
and
apparent
declaration
of
all
his
thoughts
and
feelings
he
exercised
the
most
exalted
tact
and
wisest
discrimination
he
handled
and
moved
men
remotely
as
we
do
pieces
upon
a
chessboard
he
retained
through
life
all
the
friends
he
ever
had
and
he
made
the
wrath
of
his
enemies
to
praise
him
this
was
not
by
cunning
or
intrigue
in
the
low
acceptation
of
the
term
but
by
farseeing
reason
and
discernment
he
always
told
only
enough
of
his
plans
and
purposes
to
induce
the
belief
that
he
had
communicated
all
yet
he
reserved
enough
to
have
communicated
nothing
sweet
but
mild
revenge
when
the
united
states
found
that
a
war
with
black
hawk
could
not
be
dodged
governor
reynolds
of
illinois
issued
a
call
for
volunteers
and
among
the
companies
that
immediately
responded
was
one
from
menard
county
illinois
many
of
these
volunteers
were
from
new
salem
and
clarys
grove
and
lincoln
being
out
of
business
was
the
first
to
enlist
the
company
being
full
the
men
held
a
meeting
at
richland
for
the
election
of
officers
lincoln
had
won
many
hearts
and
they
told
him
that
he
must
be
their
captain
it
was
an
office
to
which
he
did
not
aspire
and
for
which
he
felt
he
had
no
special
fitness
but
he
finally
consented
to
be
a
candidate
there
was
but
one
other
candidate
a
mr
kirkpatrick
who
was
one
of
the
most
influential
men
of
the
region
previously
kirkpatrick
had
been
an
employer
of
lincoln
and
was
so
overbearing
in
his
treatment
of
the
young
man
that
the
latter
left
him
the
simple
mode
of
electing
a
captain
adopted
by
the
company
was
by
placing
the
candidates
apart
and
telling
the
men
to
go
and
stand
with
the
one
they
preferred
lincoln
and
his
competitor
took
their
positions
and
then
the
word
was
given
at
least
three
out
of
every
four
went
to
lincoln
at
once
when
it
was
seen
by
those
who
had
arranged
themselves
with
the
other
candidate
that
lincoln
was
the
choice
of
the
majority
of
the
company
they
left
their
places
one
by
one
and
came
over
to
the
successful
side
until
lincolns
opponent
in
the
friendly
strife
was
left
standing
almost
alone
i
felt
badly
to
see
him
cut
so
says
a
witness
of
the
scene
here
was
an
opportunity
for
revenge
the
humble
laborer
was
his
employers
captain
but
the
opportunity
was
never
improved
mr
lincoln
frequently
confessed
that
no
subsequent
success
of
his
life
had
given
him
half
the
satisfaction
that
this
election
did
didnt
trust
the
court
in
one
of
his
many
stories
of
lincoln
his
law
partner
w
h
herndon
told
this
as
illustrating
lincolns
shrewdness
as
a
lawyer
i
was
with
lincoln
once
and
listened
to
an
oral
argument
by
him
in
which
he
rehearsed
an
extended
history
of
the
law
it
was
a
carefully
prepared
and
masterly
discourse
but
as
i
thought
entirely
useless
after
he
was
through
and
we
were
walking
home
i
asked
him
why
he
went
so
far
back
in
the
history
of
the
law
i
presumed
the
court
knew
enough
history
thats
where
youre
mistaken
was
his
instant
rejoinder
i
dared
not
just
the
case
on
the
presumption
that
the
court
knows
everythingin
fact
i
argued
it
on
the
presumption
that
the
court
didnt
know
anything
a
statement
which
when
one
reviews
the
decision
of
our
appellate
courts
is
not
so
extravagant
as
one
would
at
first
suppose
handsomest
man
on
earth
one
day
thaddeus
stevens
called
at
the
white
house
with
an
elderly
woman
whose
son
had
been
in
the
army
but
for
some
offense
had
been
courtmartialed
and
sentenced
to
death
there
were
some
extenuating
circumstances
and
after
a
full
hearing
the
president
turned
to
stevens
and
said
mr
stevens
do
you
think
this
is
a
case
which
will
warrant
my
interference
with
my
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
the
parties
was
the
reply
i
should
have
no
hesitation
in
granting
a
pardon
then
returned
mr
lincoln
i
will
pardon
him
and
proceeded
forthwith
to
execute
the
paper
the
gratitude
of
the
mother
was
too
deep
for
expression
save
by
her
tears
and
not
a
word
was
said
between
her
and
stevens
until
they
were
half
way
down
the
stairs
on
their
passage
out
when
she
suddenly
broke
forth
in
an
excited
manner
with
the
words
i
knew
it
was
a
copperhead
lie
what
do
you
refer
to
madam
asked
stevens
why
they
told
me
he
was
an
uglylooking
man
she
replied
with
vehemence
he
is
the
handsomest
man
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
that
coon
came
down
lincolns
last
warning
was
the
title
of
a
cartoon
which
appeared
in
harpers
weekly
on
october
under
the
picture
was
the
text
now
if
you
dont
come
down
ill
cut
the
tree
from
under
you
this
illustration
was
peculiarly
apt
as
on
the
st
of
january
president
lincoln
issued
his
great
emancipation
proclamation
declaring
all
slaves
in
the
united
states
forever
free
old
abe
was
a
handy
man
with
the
axe
he
having
split
many
thousands
of
rails
with
its
keen
edge
as
the
slavery
coon
wouldnt
heed
the
warning
lincoln
did
cut
the
tree
from
under
him
and
so
he
came
down
to
the
ground
with
a
heavy
thump
this
act
of
emancipation
put
an
end
to
the
notion
of
the
southern
slave
holders
that
involuntary
servitude
was
one
of
the
sacred
institutions
on
the
continent
of
north
america
it
also
demonstrated
that
lincoln
was
thoroughly
in
earnest
when
he
declared
that
he
would
not
only
save
the
union
but
that
he
meant
what
he
said
in
the
speech
wherein
he
asserted
this
nation
cannot
exist
half
slave
and
half
free
wrote
pieces
when
very
young
at
fifteen
years
of
age
abe
wrote
pieces
or
compositions
and
even
some
doggerel
rhyme
which
he
recited
to
the
great
amusement
of
his
playmates
one
of
his
first
compositions
was
against
cruelty
to
animals
he
was
very
much
annoyed
and
pained
at
the
conduct
of
the
boys
who
were
in
the
habit
of
catching
terrapins
and
putting
coals
of
fire
on
their
backs
which
thoroughly
disgusted
abraham
he
would
chide
us
said
nat
grigsby
tell
us
it
was
wrong
and
would
write
against
it
when
eighteen
years
old
abe
wrote
a
piece
on
national
politics
and
it
so
pleased
a
lawyer
friend
named
pritchard
that
the
latter
had
it
printed
in
an
obscure
paper
thereby
adding
much
to
the
authors
pride
abe
did
not
conceal
his
satisfaction
in
this
piece
he
wrote
among
other
things
the
american
government
is
the
best
form
of
government
for
an
intelligent
people
it
ought
to
be
kept
sound
and
preserved
forever
that
general
education
should
be
fostered
and
carried
all
over
the
country
that
the
constitution
should
be
saved
the
union
perpetuated
and
the
laws
revered
respected
and
enforced

upon

at
willards
hotel
washington
february
d
the
morning
of
his
arrival
and
urged
a
vigorous
firm
policy
patiently
listening
lincoln
replied
seriously
but
cheerfully
as
the
country
has
placed
me
at
the
helm
of
the
ship
ill
try
to
steer
her
through
grand
gloomy
and
peculiar
lincoln
was
a
marked
and
peculiar
young
man
people
talked
about
him
his
studious
habits
his
greed
for
information
his
thorough
mastery
of
the
difficulties
of
every
new
position
in
which
he
was
placed
his
intelligence
on
all
matters
of
public
concern
his
unwearying
goodnature
his
skill
in
telling
a
story
his
great
athletic
power
his
quaint
odd
ways
his
uncouth
appearanceall
tended
to
bring
him
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
dull
mediocrity
by
which
he
was
surrounded
denton
offutt
his
old
employer
said
after
having
had
a
conversation
with
lincoln
that
the
young
man
had
talent
enough
in
him
to
make
a
president
on
the
way
to
gettysburg
when
lincoln
was
on
his
way
to
the
national
cemetery
at
gettysburg
an
old
gentleman
told
him
that
his
only
son
fell
on
little
round
top
at
gettysburg
and
he
was
going
to
look
at
the
spot
mr
lincoln
replied
you
have
been
called
on
to
make
a
terrible
sacrifice
for
the
union
and
a
visit
to
that
spot
i
fear
will
open
your
wounds
afresh
but
oh
my
dear
sir
if
we
had
reached
the
end
of
such
sacrifices
and
had
nothing
left
for
us
to
do
but
to
place
garlands
on
the
graves
of
those
who
have
already
fallen
we
could
give
thanks
even
amidst
our
tears
but
when
i
think
of
the
sacrifices
of
life
yet
to
be
offered
and
the
hearts
and
homes
yet
to
be
made
desolate
before
this
dreadful
war
is
over
my
heart
is
like
lead
within
me
and
i
feel
at
times
like
hiding
in
deep
darkness
at
one
of
the
stopping
places
of
the
train
a
very
beautiful
child
having
a
bunch
of
rosebuds
in
her
hand
was
lifted
up
to
an
open
window
of
the
presidents
car
floweth
for
the
president
the
president
stepped
to
the
window
took
the
rosebuds
bent
down
and
kissed
the
child
saying
you
are
a
sweet
little
rosebud
yourself
i
hope
your
life
will
open
into
perpetual
beauty
and
goodness
stood
up
the
longest
there
was
a
rough
gallantry
among
the
young
people
and
lincolns
old
comrades
and
friends
in
indiana
have
left
many
tales
of
how
he
went
to
see
the
girls
of
how
he
brought
in
the
biggest
backlog
and
made
the
brightest
fire
of
how
the
young
people
sitting
around
it
watching
the
way
the
sparks
flew
told
their
fortunes
he
helped
pare
apples
shell
corn
and
crack
nuts
he
took
the
girls
to
meeting
and
to
spelling
school
though
he
was
not
often
allowed
to
take
part
in
the
spellingmatch
for
the
one
who
chose
first
always
chose
abe
lincoln
and
that
was
equivalent
to
winning
as
the
others
knew
that
he
would
stand
up
the
longest
a
mortifying
experience
a
lady
reader
or
elocutionist
came
to
springfield
in
a
large
crowd
greeted
her
among
other
things
she
recited
nothing
to
wear
a
piece
in
which
is
described
the
perplexities
that
beset
miss
flora
mcflimsy
in
her
efforts
to
appear
fashionable
in
the
midst
of
one
stanza
in
which
no
effort
is
made
to
say
anything
particularly
amusing
and
during
the
reading
of
which
the
audience
manifested
the
most
respectful
silence
and
attention
some
one
in
the
rear
seats
burst
out
with
a
loud
coarse
laugh
a
sudden
and
explosive
guffaw
it
startled
the
speaker
and
audience
and
kindled
a
storm
of
unsuppressed
laughter
and
applause
everybody
looked
back
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
demonstration
and
were
greatly
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
mr
lincoln
he
blushed
and
squirmed
with
the
awkward
diffidence
of
a
schoolboy
what
caused
him
to
laugh
no
one
was
able
to
explain
he
was
doubtless
wrapped
up
in
a
brown
study
and
recalling
some
amusing
episode
indulged
in
laughter
without
realizing
his
surroundings
the
experience
mortified
him
greatly
no
halfway
business
soon
after
mr
lincoln
began
to
practice
law
at
springfield
he
was
engaged
in
a
criminal
case
in
which
it
was
thought
there
was
little
chance
of
success
throwing
all
his
powers
into
it
he
came
off
victorious
and
promptly
received
for
his
services
five
hundred
dollars
a
legal
friend
calling
upon
him
the
next
morning
found
him
sitting
before
a
table
upon
which
his
money
was
spread
out
counting
it
over
and
over
look
here
judge
said
he
see
what
a
heap
of
money
ive
got
from
this
case
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
why
i
never
had
so
much
money
in
my
life
before
put
it
all
together
then
crossing
his
arms
upon
the
table
his
manner
sobering
down
he
added
i
have
got
just
five
hundred
dollars
if
it
were
only
seven
hundred
and
fifty
i
would
go
directly
and
purchase
a
quarter
section
of
land
and
settle
it
upon
my
old
stepmother
his
friend
said
that
if
the
deficiency
was
all
he
needed
he
would
loan
him
the
amount
taking
his
note
to
which
mr
lincoln
instantly
acceded
his
friend
then
said
lincoln
i
would
do
just
what
you
have
indicated
your
stepmother
is
getting
old
and
will
not
probably
live
many
years
i
would
settle
the
property
upon
her
for
her
use
during
her
lifetime
to
revert
to
you
upon
her
death
with
much
feeling
mr
lincoln
replied
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
it
is
a
poor
return
at
best
for
all
the
good
womans
devotion
and
fidelity
to
me
and
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
halfway
business
about
it
and
so
saying
he
gathered
up
his
money
and
proceeded
forthwith
to
carry
his
longcherished
purpose
into
execution
discouraged
litigation
lincoln
believed
in
preventing
unnecessary
litigation
and
carried
out
this
in
his
practice
who
was
your
guardian
he
asked
a
young
man
who
came
to
him
to
complain
that
a
part
of
the
property
left
him
had
been
withheld
enoch
kingsbury
replied
the
young
man
i
know
mr
kingsbury
said
lincoln
and
he
is
not
the
man
to
have
cheated
you
out
of
a
cent
and
i
cant
take
the
case
and
advise
you
to
drop
the
subject
and
it
was
dropped

edwin
m
stanton
was
one
of
the
attorneys
in
the
great
reaper
patent
case
heard
in
cincinnati
in
lincoln
also
having
been
retained
the
latter
was
rather
anxious
to
deliver
the
argument
on
the
general
propositions
of
law
applicable
to
the
case
but
it
being
decided
to
have
mr
stanton
do
this
the
westerner
made
no
complaint
speaking
of
stantons
argument
and
the
view
lincoln
took
of
it
ralph
emerson
a
young
lawyer
who
was
present
at
the
trial
said
the
final
summing
up
on
our
side
was
by
mr
stanton
and
though
he
took
but
about
three
hours
in
its
delivery
he
had
devoted
as
many
if
not
more
weeks
to
its
preparation
it
was
very
able
and
mr
lincoln
was
throughout
the
whole
of
it
a
rapt
listener
mr
stanton
closed
his
speech
in
a
flight
of
impassioned
eloquence
then
the
court
adjourned
for
the
day
and
mr
lincoln
invited
me
to
take
a
long
walk
with
him
for
block
after
block
he
walked
rapidly
forward
not
saying
a
word
evidently
deeply
dejected
at
last
he
turned
suddenly
to
me
exclaiming
emerson
i
am
going
home
a
pause
i
am
going
home
to
study
law
why
i
exclaimed
mr
lincoln
you
stand
at
the
head
of
the
bar
in
illinois
now
what
are
you
talking
about
ah
yes
he
said
i
do
occupy
a
good
position
there
and
i
think
that
i
can
get
along
with
the
way
things
are
done
there
now
but
these
collegetrained
men
who
have
devoted
their
whole
lives
to
study
are
coming
west
dont
you
see
and
they
study
their
cases
as
we
never
do
they
have
got
as
far
as
cincinnati
now
they
will
soon
be
in
illinois
another
long
pause
then
stopping
and
turning
toward
me
his
countenance
suddenly
assuming
that
look
of
strong
determination
which
those
who
knew
him
best
sometimes
saw
upon
his
face
he
exclaimed
i
am
going
home
to
study
law
i
am
as
good
as
any
of
them
and
when
they
get
out
to
illinois
i
will
be
ready
for
them
the
railsputter
repairing
the

the
cartoon
given
here
in
facsimile
was
one
of
the
posters
which
decorated
the
picturesque
presidential
campaign
of
and
assisted
in
making
the
period
previous
to
the
votecasting

lively
and
memorable
one
this
poster
was

indicate
the

candidate
on
the
republican
national
ticket
andrew
johnson
as
an
aid
in
the
work
johnson
was
in
early
life
a
tailor
and
he
is
pictured
as
busily
engaged
in
sewing
up
the
rents
made
in
the
map
of
the
union
by
the
secessionists
both
men
are
thoroughly
in
earnest
and
as
history
relates
the
torn
places
in
the
union
map
were
stitched
together
so
nicely
that
no
one
could
have
told
by
mere
observation
that
a
tear
had
ever
been
made
andrew
johnson
who
succeeded
lincoln
upon
the
assassination
of
the
latter
was
a
remarkable
man
born
in
north
carolina
he
removed
to
tennessee
when
young
was
congressman
governor
and
united
states
senator
being
made
military
governor
of
his
state
in
a
strong
stanch
union
man
he
was
nominated
for
the
vicepresidency
on
the
lincoln
ticket
to
conciliate
the
war
democrats
after
serving
out
his
term
as
president
he
was
again
elected
united
states
senator
from
tennessee
but
died
shortly
after
taking
his
seat
but
he
was
just
the
sort
of
a
man
to
assist
uncle
abe
in
sewing
up
the
torn
places
in
the
union
map
and
as
military
governor
of
tennessee
was
a
powerful
factor
in
winning
friends

several
of

lawyers
remarked
one
of
his
colleagues
in
the
eastern
end
of
the
circuit
annoyed
lincoln
once
while
he
was
holding
court
for
davis
by
attempting
to
defend
against
a
note
to
which
there
were
many
makers
we
had
no
legal
but
a
good
moral
defense
but
what
we
wanted
most
of
all
was
to
stave
it
off
till
the
next

of

by
one
expedient
or
another
we
bothered
the
court
about
it
till
late
on

the

of

he
adjourned
for

with
nothing
left
but
this

to

of

he
heard
our

of

on

from

ventured
to
enquire

lincoln
how
can
we
get
this

lincoln
eyed
him
quizzically
for
a
moment
and
then
answered

rough
on
the
negro
mr
lincoln
one
day
was
talking
with
the
rev
dr
sunderland
about
the
emancipation
proclamation
and
the
future
of
the
negro
suddenly
a
ripple
of
amusement
broke
the
solemn
tone
of
his
voice
as
for
the
negroes
doctor
and
what
is
going
to
become
of
them
i
told
ben
wade
the
other
day
that
it
made
me
think
of
a
story
i
read
in
one
of
my
first
books
aesops
fables
it
was
an
old
edition
and
had
curious
rough
wood
cuts
one
of
which
showed
three
white
men
scrubbing
a
negro
in
a
potash
kettle
filled
with
cold
water
the
text
explained
that
the
men
thought
that
by
scrubbing
the
negro
they
might
make
him
white
just
about
the
time
they
thought
they
were
succeeding
he
took
cold
and
died
now
i
am
afraid
that
by
the
time
we
get
through
this
war
the
negro
will
catch
cold
and
die
challenged
all
comers
personal
encounters
were
of
frequent
occurrence
in
gentryville
in
early
days
and
the
prestige
of
having
thrashed
an
opponent
gave
the
victor
marked
social
distinction
green
b
taylor
with
whom
abe
worked
the
greater
part
of
one
winter
on
a
farm
furnished
an
account
of
the
noted
fight
between
john
johnston
abes
stepbrother
and
william
grigsby
in
which
stirring
drama
abe
himself
played
an
important
role
before
the
curtain
was
rung
down
taylors
father
was
the
second
for
johnston
and
william
whitten
officiated
in
a
similar
capacity
for
grigsby
they
had
a
terrible
fight
related
taylor
and
it
soon
became
apparent
that
grigsby
was
too
much
for
lincolns
man
johnston
after
they
had
fought
a
long
time
without
interference
it
having
been
agreed
not
to
break
the
ring
abe
burst
through
caught
grigsby
threw
him
off
and
some
feet
away
there
grigsby
stood
proud
as
lucifer
and
swinging
a
bottle
of
liquor
over
his
head
swore
he
was
the
big
buck
of
the
lick
if
any
one
doubts
it
he
shouted
he
has
only
to
come
on
and
whet
his
horns
a
general
engagement
followed
this
challenge
but
at
the
end
of
hostilities
the
field
was
cleared
and
the
wounded
retired

the
exultant
shouts
of
their
victors
government
rests
in
public
opinion
lincoln
delivered
a
speech
at
a
republican
banquet
at
chicago
december
th
just
after
the
presidential
campaign
of
that
year
in
which
he
said
our
government
rests
in
public
opinion
whoever
can
change
public
opinion
can
change
the
government
practically
just
so
much
public
opinion
on
any
subject
always
has
a
central
idea
from
which
all
its
minor
thoughts
radiate
that
central
idea
in
our
political
public
opinion
at
the
beginning
was
and
until
recently
has
continued
to
be
the
equality
of
man
and
although
it
has
always
submitted
patiently
to
whatever
of
inequality
there
seemed
to
be
as
a
matter
of
actual
necessity
its
constant
working
has
been
a
steady
progress
toward
the
practical
equality
of
all
men
let
everyone
who
really
believes
and
is
resolved
that
free
society
is
not
and
shall
not
be
a
failure
and
who
can
conscientiously
declare
that
in
the
past
contest
he
has
done
only
what
he
thought
bestlet
every
such
one
have
charity
to
believe
that
every
other
one
can
say
as
much
thus
let
bygones
be
bygones
let
party
differences
as
nothing
be
and
with
steady
eye
on
the
real
issue
let
us
reinaugurate
the
good
old
central
ideas
of
the
republic
we
can
do
it
the
human
heart
is
with
us
god
is
with
us
we
shall
never
be
able
to
declare
that
all
states
as
states
are
equal
nor
yet
that
all
citizens
are
equal
but
to
renew
the
broader
better
declaration

both
these

president
lincoln
in
his
message
to
congress
in
december
said
the
united
states
had
given
notice
to
england
that
at
the
end
of
six
months
this
country
would
if
necessary
increase
its
naval
armament
upon

what
great
britain
feared
was
the
abrogation
by

of
all
treaties
regarding

by

stipulation
the
united
states
and
england
were
each
to
have
but
one
war
vessel
on

great
lakes
saw
himself
dead
this
story
cannot
be
repeated
in
lincolns
own
language
although
he
told
it
often
enough
to
intimate
friends
but
as
it
was
never
taken
down
by
a
stenographer
in
the
martyred
presidents
exact
words
the
reader
must
accept
a
simple
narration
of
the
strange
occurrence
it
was
not
long
after
the
first
nomination
of
lincoln
for
the
presidency
when
he
saw
or
imagined
he
saw
the
startling
apparition
one
day
feeling
weary
he
threw
himself
upon
a
lounge
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
his
house
at
springfield
to
rest
opposite
the
lounge
upon
which
he
was
lying
was
a
large
long
mirror
and
he
could
easily
see
the
reflection
of
his
form
full
length
suddenly
he
saw
or
imagined
he
saw
two
lincolns
in
the
mirror
each
lying
full
length
upon
the
lounge
but
they
differed
strangely
in
appearance
one
was
the
natural
lincoln
full
of
life
vigor
energy
and
strength
the
other
was
a
dead
lincoln
the
face
white
as
marble
the
limbs
nerveless
and
lifeless
the
body
inert
and
still
lincoln
was
so
impressed
with
this
vision
which
he
considered
merely
an
optical
illusion
that
he
arose
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
for
a
walk
returning
to
the
house
he
determined
to
test
the
matter
againand
the
result
was
the
same
as
before
he
distinctly
saw
the
two
lincolnsone
living
and
the
other
dead
he
said
nothing
to
his
wife
about
this
she
being
at
that
time
in
a
nervous
condition
and
apprehensive
that
some
accident
would
surely
befall
her
husband
she
was
particularly
fearful
that
he
might
be
the
victim
of
an
assassin
lincoln
always
made
light
of
her
fears
but
yet
he
was
never
easy
in
his
mind
afterwards
to
more
thoroughly
test
the
socalled
optical
illusion
and
prove
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
whether
it
was
a
mere
fanciful
creation
of
the
brain
or
a
reflection
upon
the
broad
face
of
the
mirror
which
might
be
seen
at
any
time
lincoln
made
frequent
experiments
each
and
every
time
the
result
was
the
same
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
two
lincolnsone
living
and
the
other
dead
lincoln
never
saw
this
forbidding
reflection
while
in
the
white
house
time
after
time
he
placed
a
couch
in
front
of
a
mirror
at
a
distance
from
the
glass
where
he
could
view
his
entire
length
while
lying
down
but
the
lookingglass
in
the
executive
mansion
was
faithful
to
its
trust
and
only
the
living
lincoln
was
observable
the
late
ward
lamon
once
a
law
partner
of
lincoln
and
marshal
of
the
district
of
columbia
during
his
first
administration
tells
in
his
recollections
of
abraham
lincoln
of
the
dreams
the
president
hadall
foretelling
death
lamon
was
lincolns
most
intimate
friend
being
practically
his
bodyguard
and
slept
in
the
white
house
in
reference
to
lincolns
death
dreams
he
says
how
it
may
be
asked
could
he
make
life
tolerable
burdened
as
he
was
with
that
portentous
horror
which
though
visionary
and
of
trifling
import
in
our
eyes
was
by
his
interpretation
a
premonition
of
impending
doom
i
answer
in
a
word
his
sense
of
duty
to
his
country
his
belief
that
the
inevitable
is
right
and
his
innate
and
irrepressible
humor
but
the
most
startling
incident
in
the
life
of
mr
lincoln
was
a
dream
he
had
only
a
few
days
before
his
assassination
to
him
it
was
a
thing
of
deadly
import
and
certainly
no
vision
was
ever
fashioned
more
exactly
like
a
dread
reality
coupled
with
other
dreams
with
the
mirrorscene
and
with
other
incidents
there
was
something
about
it
so
amazingly
real
so
true
to
the
actual
tragedy
which
occurred
soon
after
that
more
than
mortal
strength
and
wisdom
would
have
been
required
to
let
it
pass
without
a
shudder
or
a
pang
after
worrying
over
it
for
some
days
mr
lincoln
seemed
no
longer
able
to
keep
the
secret
i
give
it
as
nearly
in
his
own
words
as
i
can
from
notes
which
i
made
immediately
after
its
recital
there
were
only
two
or
three
persons
present
the
president
was
in
a
melancholy
meditative
mood
and
had
been
silent
for
some
time
mrs
lincoln
who
was
present
rallied
him
on
his
solemn
visage
and
want
of
spirit
this
seemed
to
arouse
him
and
without
seeming
to
notice
her
sally
he
said
in
slow
and
measured
tones
it
seems
strange
how
much
there
is
in
the
bible
about
dreams
there
are
i
think
some
sixteen
chapters
in
the
old
testament
and
four
or
five
in
the
new
in
which
dreams
are
mentioned
and
there
are
many
other
passages
scattered
throughout
the
book
which
refer
to
visions
in
the
old
days
god
and
his
angels
came
to
men
in
their
sleep
and
made
themselves
known
in
dreams
mrs
lincoln
here
remarked
why
you
look
dreadfully
solemn
do
you
believe
in
dreams
i
cant
say
that
i
do
returned
mr
lincoln
but
i
had
one
the
other
night
which
has
haunted
me
ever
since
after
it
occurred
the
first
time
i
opened
the
bible
and
strange
as
it
may
appear
it
was
at
the
twentyeighth
chapter
of
genesis
which
relates
the
wonderful
dream
jacob
had
i
turned
to
other
passages
and
seemed
to
encounter
a
dream
or
a
vision
wherever
i
looked
i
kept
on
turning
the
leaves
of
the
old
book
and
everywhere
my
eyes
fell
upon
passages
recording
matters
strangely
in
keeping
with
my
own
thoughtssupernatural
visitations
dreams
visions
etc
he
now
looked
so
serious
and
disturbed
that
mrs
lincoln
exclaimed
you
frighten
me
what
is
the
matter
i
am
afraid
said
mr
lincoln
observing
the
effect
his
words
had
upon
his
wife
that
i
have
done
wrong
to
mention
the
subject
at
all
but
somehow
the
thing
has
got
possession
of
me
and
like
banquos
ghost
it
will
not
down
this
only
inflamed
mrs
lincolns
curiosity
the
more
and
while
bravely
disclaiming
any
belief
in
dreams
she
strongly
urged
him
to
tell
the
dream
which
seemed
to
have
such
a
hold
upon
him
being
seconded
in
this
by
another
listener
mr
lincoln
hesitated
but
at
length
commenced
very
deliberately
his
brow
overcast
with
a
shade
of
melancholy
about
ten
days
ago
said
he
i
retired
very
late
i
had
been
up
waiting
for
important
dispatches
from
the
front
i
could
not
have
been
long
in
bed
when
i
fell
into
a
slumber
for
i
was
weary
i
soon
began
to
dream
there
seemed
to
be
a
deathlike
stillness
about
me
then
i
heard
subdued
sobs
as
if
a
number
of
people
were
weeping
i
thought
i
left
my
bed
and
wandered
downstairs
there
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
same
pitiful
sobbing
but
the
mourners
were
invisible
i
went
from
room
to
room
no
living
person
was
in
sight
but
the
same
mournful
sounds
of
distress
met
me
as
i
passed
along
it
was
light
in
all
the
rooms
every
object
was
familiar
to
me
but
where
were
all
the
people
who
were
grieving
as
if
their
hearts
would
break
i
was
puzzled
and
alarmed
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
determined
to
find
the
cause
of
a
state
of
things
so
mysterious
and
so
shocking
i
kept
on
until
i
arrived
at
the
east
room
which
i
entered
there
i
met
with
a
sickening
surprise
before
me
was
a
catafalque
on
which
rested
a
corpse
wrapped
in
funeral
vestments
around
it
were
stationed
soldiers
who
were
acting
as
guards
and
there
was
a
throng
of
people
some
gazing
mournfully
upon
the
corpse
whose
face
was
covered
others
weeping
pitifully
who
is
dead
in
the
white
house
i
demanded
of
one
of
the
soldiers
the
president
was
his
answer
he
was
killed
by
an
assassin
then
came
a
loud
burst
of
grief
from
the
crowd
which
awoke
me
from
my
dream
i
slept
no
more
that
night
and
although
it
was
only
a
dream
i
have
been
strangely
annoyed
by
it
ever
since
that
is
horrid
said
mrs
lincoln
i
wish
you
had
not
told
it
i
am
glad
i
dont
believe
in
dreams
or
i
should
be
in
terror
from
this
time
forth
well
responded
mr
lincoln
thoughtfully
it
is
only
a
dream
mary
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
and
try
to
forget
it
this
dream
was
so
horrible
so
real
and
so
in
keeping
with
other
dreams
and
threatening
presentiments
of
his
that
mr
lincoln
was
profoundly
disturbed
by
it
during
its
recital
he
was
grave
gloomy
and
at
times
visibly
pale
but
perfectly
calm
he
spoke
slowly
with
measured
accents
and
deep
feeling
in
conversations
with
me
he
referred
to
it
afterwards
closing
one
with
this
quotation
from
hamlet
to
sleep
perchance
to
dream
ay
theres
the
rub
with
a
strong
accent
upon
the
last
three
words
once
the
president
alluded
to
this
terrible
dream
with
some
show
of
playful
humor
hill
said
he
your
apprehension
of
harm
to
me
from
some
hidden
enemy
is
downright
foolishness
for
a
long
time
you
have
been
trying
to
keep
somebodythe
lord
knows
whofrom
killing
me
dont
you
see
how
it
will
turn
out
in
this
dream
it
was
not
me
but
some
other
fellow
that
was
killed
it
seems
that
this
ghostly
assassin
tried
his
hand
on
some
one
else
and
this
reminds
me
of
an
old
farmer
in
illinois
whose
family
were
made
sick
by
eating
greens
some
poisonous
herb
had
got
into
the
mess
and
members
of
the
family
were
in
danger
of
dying
there
was
a
halfwitted
boy
in
the
family
called
jake
and
always
afterward
when
they
had
greens
the
old
man
would
say
now
afore
we
risk
these
greens
lets
try
em
on
jake
if
he
stands
em
were
all
right
just
so
with
me
as
long
as
this
imaginary
assassin
continues
to
exercise
himself
on
others
i
can
stand
it
he
then
became
serious
and
said
well
let
it
go
i
think
the
lord
in
his
own
good
time
and
way
will
work
this
out
all
right
god
knows
what
is
best
these
words
he
spoke
with
a
sigh
and
rather
in
a
tone
of
soliloquy
as
if
hardly
noting
my
presence
mr
lincoln
had
another
remarkable
dream
which
was
repeated
so
frequently
during
his
occupancy
of
the
white
house
that
he
came
to
regard
it
is
a
welcome
visitor
it
was
of
a
pleasing
and
promising
character
having
nothing
in
it
of
the
horrible
it
was
always
an
omen
of
a
union
victory
and
came
with
unerring
certainty
just
before
every
military
or
naval
engagement
where
our
arms
were
crowned
with
success
in
this
dream
he
saw
a
ship
sailing
away
rapidly
badly
damaged
and
our
victorious
vessels
in
close
pursuit
he
saw
also
the
close
of
a
battle
on
land
the
enemy
routed
and
our
forces
in
possession
of
vantage
ground
of
inestimable
importance
mr
lincoln
stated
it
as
a
fact
that
he
had
this
dream
just
before
the
battles
of
antietam
gettysburg
and
other
signal
engagements
throughout
the
war
the
last
time
mr
lincoln
had
this
dream
was
the
night
before
his
assassination
on
the
morning
of
that
lamentable
day
there
was
a
cabinet
meeting
at
which
general
grant
was
present
during
an
interval
of
general
discussion
the
president
asked
general
grant
if
he
had
any
news
from
general
sherman
who
was
then
confronting
johnston
the
reply
was
in
the
negative
but
the
general
added
that
he
was
in
hourly
expectation
of
a
dispatch
announcing
johnstons
surrender
mr
lincoln
then
with
great
impressiveness
said
we
shall
hear
very
soon
and
the
news
will
be
important
general
grant
asked
him
why
he
thought
so
because
said
mr
lincoln
i
had
a
dream
last
night
and
ever
since
this
war
began
i
have
had
the
same
dream
just
before
every
event
of
great
national
importance
it
portends
some
important
event
which
will
happen
very
soon
on
the
night
of
the
fateful
th
of
april
mrs
lincolns
first
exclamation
after
the
president
was
shot
was
his
dream
was
prophetic
lincoln
was
a
believer
in
certain
phases
of
the
supernatural
assured
as
he
undoubtedly
was
by
omens
which
to
his
mind
were
conclusive
that
he
would
rise
to
greatness
and
power
he
was
as
firmly
convinced
by
the
same
tokens
that
he
would
be
suddenly
cut
off
at
the
height
of
his
career
and
the
fullness
of
his
fame
he
always
believed
that
he
would
fall
by
the
hand
of
an
assassin
mr
lincoln
had
this
further
idea
dreams
being
natural
occurrences
in
the
strictest
sense
he
held
that
their
best
interpreters
are
the
common
people
and
this
accounts
in
great
measure
for
the
profound
respect
he
always
had
for
the
collective
wisdom
of
plain
peoplethe
children
of
nature
he
called
themtouching
matters
belonging
to
the
domain
of
psychical
mysteries
there
was
some
basis
of
truth
he
believed
for
whatever
obtained
general
credence
among
these
children
of
nature
concerning
presentiments
and
dreams
mr
lincoln
had
a
philosophy
of
his
own
which
strange
as
it
may
appear
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
his
character
in
all
other
respects
he
was
no
dabbler
in
divinationastrology
horoscopy
prophecy
ghostly
lore
or
witcheries
of
any
sort
every
little
helped
as
the
time
drew
near
at
which
mr
lincoln
said
he
would
issue
the
emancipation
proclamation
some
clergymen
who
feared
the
president
might
change
his
mind
called
on
him
to
urge
him
to
keep
his
promise
we
were
ushered
into
the
cabinet
room
says
dr
sunderland
it
was
very
dim
but
one
gas
jet
burning
as
we
entered
mr
lincoln
was
standing
at
the
farther
end
of
the
long
table
which
filled
the
center
of
the
room
as
i
stood
by
the
door
i
am
so
very
short
that
i
was
obliged
to
look
up
to
see
the
president
mr
robbins
introduced
me
and
i
began
at
once
by
saying
i
have
come
mr
president
to
anticipate
the
new
year
with
my
respects
and
if
i
may
to
say
to
you
a
word
about
the
serious
condition
of
this
country
go
ahead
doctor
replied
the
president
every
little
helps
but
i
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
laugh
at
his
sally
at
my
smallness
about
to
lay
down
the
burden
president
lincoln
at
times
said
he
felt
sure
his
life
would
end
with
the
war
a
correspondent
of
a
boston
paper
had
an
interview
with
him
in
july
and
wrote
regarding
it
the
president
told
me
he
was
certain
he
should
not
outlast
the
rebellion
as
will
be
remembered
there
was
dissension
then
among
the
republican
leaders
many
of
his
best
friends
had
deserted
him
and
were
talking
of
an
opposition
convention
to
nominate
another
candidate
and
universal
gloom
was
among
the
people
the
north
was
tired
of
the
war
and
supposed
an
honorable
peace
attainable
mr
lincoln
knew
it
was
notthat
any
peace
at
that
time
would
be
only
disunion
speaking
of
it
he
said
i
have
faith
in
the
people
they
will
not
consent
to
disunion
the
danger
is
they
are
misled
let
them
know
the
truth
and
the
country
is
safe
he
looked
haggard
and
careworn
and
further
on
in
the
interview
i
remarked
on
his
appearance
you
are
wearing
yourself
out
with
work
i
cant
work
less
he
answered
but
it
isnt
thatwork
never
troubled
me
things
look
badly
and
i
cant
avoid
anxiety
personally
i
care
nothing
about
a
reelection
but
if
our
divisions
defeat
us
i
fear
for
the
country
when
i
suggested
that
right
must
eventually
triumph
he
replied
i
grant
that
but
i
may
never
live
to
see
it
i
feel
a
presentiment
that
i
shall
not
outlast
the
rebellion
when
it
is
over
my
work
will
be
done
he
never
intimated
however
that
he
expected
to
be
assassinated
lincoln
would
have
preferred
death
horace
greeley
said
some
time
after
the
death
of
president
lincoln
after
the
civil
war
began
lincolns
tenacity
of
purpose
paralleled
his
former
immobility
i
believe
he
would
have
been
nearly
the
last
if
not
the
very
last
man
in
america
to
recognize
the
southern
confederacy
had
its
armies
been
triumphant
he
would
have
preferred
death
punch
and
his
little
picture
london
punch
was
not
satisfied
with
anything
president
lincoln
did
on
december
rd
after
mr
lincolns
reelection
to
the
presidency
a
cartoon
appeared
in
one
of
the
pages
of
that
genial
publication
the
reproduction
being
printed
here
labeled
the
federal
phoenix
it
attracted
great
attention
at
the
time
and
was
particularly
pleasing
to
the
enemies
of
the
united
states
as
it
showed
lincoln
as
the
phoenix
arising
from
the
ashes
of
the
federal
constitution
the
public
credit
the
freedom
of
the
press
state
rights
and
the
commerce
of
the
north
american
republic
president
lincolns
endorsement
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
meant
that
the
confederacy
was
to
be
crushed
no
matter
what
the
cost
that
the
union
of
states
was
to
be
preserved
and
that
state
rights
was
a
thing
of
the
past
punch
wished
to
create
the
impression
that
president
lincolns
reelection
was
a
personal
victory
that
he
would
set
up
a
despotism
with
himself
at
its
head
and
trample
upon
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
all
the
rights
the
citizens
of
the
republic
ever
possessed
the
result
showed
that
punch
was
suffering
from
an
acute
attack
of
needless
alarm
fascinated
by
the
wonderful
lincoln
was
particularly
fascinated
by
the
wonderful
happenings
recorded
in
history
he
loved
to
read
of
those
mighty
events
which
had
been
foretold
and
often
brooded
upon
these
subjects
his
early
convictions
upon
occult
matters
led
him
to
read
all
books
tending
to
strengthen
these
convictions
the
following
lines
in
byrons
dream
were
frequently
quoted
by
him
sleep
hath
its
own
world
a
boundary
between
the
things
misnamed
death
and
existence
sleep
hath
its
own
world
and
a
wide
realm
of
wild
reality
and
dreams
in
their
development
have
breath
and
tears
and
tortures
and
the
touch
of
joy
they
leave
a
weight
upon
our
waking
thoughts
they
take
a
weight
from
off
our
waking
toils
they
do
divide
our
being
those
with
whom
he
was
associated
in
his
early
youth
and
young
manhood
and
with
whom
he
was
always
in
cordial
sympathy
were
thorough
believers
in
presentiments
and
dreams
and
so
lincoln
drifted
on
through
years
of
toil
and
exceptional
hardshipmeditative
aspiring
certain
of
his
star
but
appalled
at
times
by
its
malignant
aspect
many
times
prior
to
his
first
election
to
the
presidency
he
was
both
elated
and
alarmed
by
what
seemed
to
him
a
rent
in
the
veil
which
hides
from
mortal
view
what
the
future
holds
he
saw
or
thought
he
saw
a
vision
of
glory
and
of
blood
himself
the
central
figure
in
a
scene
which
his
fancy
transformed
from
giddy
enchantment
to
the
most
appalling
tragedy
why
dont
they
come
the
suspense
of
the
days
when
the
capital
was
isolated
the
expected
troops
not
arriving
and
an
hourly
attack
feared
wore
on
mr
lincoln
greatly
i
begin
to
believe
he
said
bitterly
one
day
to
some
massachusetts
soldiers
that
there
is
no
north
the
seventh
regiment
is
a
myth
rhode
island
is
another
you
are
the
only
real
thing
and
again
after
pacing
the
floor
of
his
deserted
office
for
a
halfhour
he
was
heard
to
exclaim
to
himself
in
an
anguished
tone
why
dont
they
come
why
dont
they
come
grants
brand
of
whiskey
lincoln
was
not
a
man
of
impulse
and
did
nothing
upon
the
spur
of
the
moment
action
with
him
was
the
result
of
deliberation
and
study
he
took
nothing
for
granted
he
judged
men
by
their
performances
and
not
their
speech
if
a
general
lost
battles
lincoln
lost
confidence
in
him
if
a
commander
was
successful
lincoln
put
him
where
he
would
be
of
the
most
service
to
the
country
grant
is
a
drunkard
asserted
powerful
and
influential
politicians
to
the
president
at
the
white
house
time
after
time
he
is
not
himself
half
the
time
he
cant
be
relied
upon
and
it
is
a
shame
to
have
such
a
man
in
command
of
an
army
so
grant
gets
drunk
does
he
queried
lincoln
addressing
himself
to
one
of
the
particularly
active
detractors
of
the
soldier
who
at
that
period
was
inflicting
heavy
damage
upon
the
confederates
yes
he
does
and
i
can
prove
it
was
the
reply
well
returned
lincoln
with
the
faintest
suspicion
of
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
you
neednt
waste
your
time
getting
proof
you
just
find
out
to
oblige
me
what
brand
of
whiskey
grant
drinks
because
i
want
to
send
a
barrel
of
it
to
each
one
of
my
generals
that
ended
the
crusade
against
grant
so
far
as
the
question
of
drinking
was
concerned
his
financial
standing
a
new
york
firm
applied
to
abraham
lincoln
some
years
before
he
became
president
for
information
as
to
the
financial
standing
of
one
of
his
neighbors
mr
lincoln
replied
i
am
well
acquainted
with
mr
and
know
his
circumstances
first
of
all
he
has
a
wife
and
baby
together
they
ought
to
be
worth
to
any
man
secondly
he
has
an
office
in
which
there
is
a
table
worth
and
three
chairs
worth
say
last
of
all
there
is
in
one
corner
a
large
rat
hole
which
will
bear
looking
into
respectfully
a
lincoln
the
dandy
and
the
boys
president
lincoln
appointed
as
consul
to
a
south
american
country
a
young
man
from
ohio
who
was
a
dandy
a
wag
met
the
new
appointee
on
his
way
to
the
white
house
to
thank
the
president
he
was
dressed
in
the
most
extravagant
style
the
wag
horrified
him
by
telling
him
that
the
country
to
which
he
was
assigned
was
noted
chiefly
for
the
bugs
that
abounded
there
and
made
life
unbearable
theyll
bore
a
hole
clean
through
you
before
a
week
has
passed
was
the
comforting
assurance
of
the
wag
as
they
parted
at
the
white
house
steps
the
new
consul
approached
lincoln
with
disappointment
clearly
written
all
over
his
face
instead
of
joyously
thanking
the
president
he
told
him
the
wags
story
of
the
bugs
i
am
informed
mr
president
he
said
that
the
place
is
full
of
vermin
and
that
they
could
eat
me
up
in
a
weeks
time
well
young
man
replied
lincoln
if
thats
true
all
ive
got
to
say
is
that
if
such
a
thing
happened
they
would
leave
a
mighty
good
suit
of
clothes
behind
some
ugly
old
lawyer
a
w
swan
of
albuquerque
new
mexico
told
this
story
on
lincoln
being
an
eyewitness
of
the
scene
one
day
president
lincoln
was
met
in
the
park
between
the
white
house
and
the
war
department
by
an
irate
private
soldier
who
was
swearing
in
a
high
key
cursing
the
government
from
the
president
down
mr
lincoln
paused
and
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
matter
enough
was
the
reply
i
want
my
money
i
have
been
discharged
here
and
cant
get
my
pay
mr
lincoln
asked
if
he
had
his
papers
saying
that
he
used
to
practice
law
in
a
small
way
and
possibly
could
help
him
my
friend
and
i
stepped
behind
some
convenient
shrubbery
where
we
could
watch
the
result
mr
lincoln
took
the
papers
from
the
hands
of
the
crippled
soldier
and
sat
down
with
him
at
the
foot
of
a
convenient
tree
where
he
examined
them
carefully
and
writing
a
line
on
the
back
told
the
soldier
to
take
them
to
mr
potts
chief
clerk
of
the
war
department
who
would
doubtless
attend
to
the
matter
at
once
after
mr
lincoln
had
left
the
soldier
we
stepped
out
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
whom
he
had
been
talking
with
some
ugly
old
fellow
who
pretends
to
be
a
lawyer
was
the
reply
my
companion
asked
to
see
the
papers
and
on
their
being
handed
to
him
pointed
to
the
indorsement
they
had
received
this
indorsement
read
mr
potts
attend
to
this
mans
case
at
once
and
see
that
he
gets
his
pay
a
l
good
memory
of
names
the
following
story
illustrates
the
power
of
mr
lincolns
memory
of
names
and
faces
when
he
was
a
comparatively
young
man
and
a
candidate
for
the
illinois
legislature
he
made
a
personal
canvass
of
the
district
while
swinging
around
the
circle
he
stopped
one
day
and
took
dinner
with
a
farmer
in
sangamon
county
years
afterward
when
mr
lincoln
had
become
president
a
soldier
came
to
call
on
him
at
the
white
house
at
the
first
glance
the
chief
executive
said
yes
i
remember
you
used
to
live
on
the
danville
road
i
took
dinner
with
you
when
i
was
running
for
the
legislature
i
recollect
that
we
stood
talking
out
at
the
barnyard
gate
while
i
sharpened
my
jackknife
yaas
drawled
the
soldier
you
did
but
say
wherever
did
you
put
that
whetstone
i
looked
for
it
a
dozen
times
but
i
never
could
find
it
after
the
day
you
used
it
we
allowed
as
how
mabby
you
took
it
long
with
you
no
said
lincoln
looking
serious
and
pushing
away
a
lot
of
documents
of
state
from
the
desk
in
front
of
him
no
i
put
it
on
top
of
that
gatepostthat
high
one
well
exclaimed
the
visitor
mabby
you
did
couldnt
anybody
else
have
put
it
there
and
none
of
us
ever
thought
of
looking
there
for
it
the
soldier
was
then
on
his
way
home
and
when
he
got
there
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
look
for
the
whetstone
and
sure
enough
there
it
was
just
where
lincoln
had
laid
it
fifteen
years
before
the
honest
fellow
wrote
a
letter
to
the
chief
magistrate
telling
him
that
the
whetstone
had
been
found
and
would
never
be
lost
again
settled
out
of
court
when
abe
lincoln
used
to
be
drifting
around
the
country
practicing
law
in
fulton
and
menard
counties
illinois
an
old
fellow
met
him
going
to
lewiston
riding
a
horse
which
while
it
was
a
serviceable
enough
animal
was
not
of
the
kind
to
be
truthfully
called
a
fine
saddler
it
was
a
weatherbeaten
nag
patient
and
plodding
and
it
toiled
along
with
abeand
abes
books
tucked
away
in
saddlebags
lay
heavy
on
the
horses
flank
hello

lincoln
with
a
smile
on
his
gaunt
face
rode
on
toward
lewiston
the
five
points
sunday
school
when
mr
lincoln
visited
new
york
in
he
felt
a
great
interest
in
many
of
the
institutions
for
reforming
criminals
and
saving
the
young
from
a
life
of
crime
among
others
he
visited
unattended
the
five
points
house
of
industry
and
the
superintendent
of
the
sabbath
school
there
gave
the
following
account
of
the
event
one
sunday
morning
i
saw
a
tall
remarkablelooking
man
enter
the
room
and
take
a
seat
among
us
he
listened
with
fixed
attention
to
our
exercises
and
his
countenance
expressed
such
genuine
interest
that
i
approached
him
and
suggested
that
he
might
be
willing
to
say
something
to
the
children
he
accepted
the
invitation
with
evident
pleasure
and
coming
forward
began
a
simple
address
which
at
once
fascinated
every
little
hearer
and
hushed
the
room
into
silence
his
language
was
strikingly
beautiful
and
his
tones
musical
with
intense
feeling
the
little
faces
would
droop
into
sad
conviction
when
he
uttered
sentences
of
warning
and
would
brighten
into
sunshine
as
he
spoke
cheerful
words
of
promise
once
or
twice
he
attempted
to
close
his
remarks
but
the
imperative
shout
of
go
on
oh
do
go
on
would
compel
him
to
resume
as
i
looked
upon
the
gaunt
and
sinewy
frame
of
the
stranger
and
marked
his
powerful
head
and
determined
features
now
touched
into
softness
by
the
impressions
of
the
moment
i
felt
an
irrepressible
curiosity
to
learn
something
more
about
him
and
while
he
was
quietly
leaving
the
room
i
begged
to
know
his
name
he
courteously
replied
it
is
abraham
lincoln
from
illinois
sentinel
obeyed
orders
a
slight
variation
of
the
traditional
sentry
story
is
related
by
c
c
buel
it
was
a
cold
blusterous
winter
night
says
mr
buel
mr
lincoln
emerged
from
the
front
door
his
lank
figure
bent
over
as
he
drew
tightly
about
his
shoulders
the
shawl
which
he
employed
for
such
protection
for
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
war
department
at
the
west
corner
of
the
grounds
where
in
times
of
battle
he
was
wont
to
get
the
midnight
dispatches
from
the
field
as
the
blast
struck
him
he
thought
of
the
numbness
of
the
pacing
sentry
and
turning
to
him
said
young
man
youve
got
a
cold
job
tonight
step
inside
and
stand
guard
there
my
orders
keep
me
out
here
the
soldier
replied
yes
said
the
president
in
his
argumentative
tone
but
your
duty
can
be
performed
just
as
well
inside
as
out
here
and
youll
oblige
me
by
going
in
i
have
been
stationed
outside
the
soldier
answered
and
resumed
his
beat
hold
on
there
said
mr
lincoln
as
he
turned
back
again
it
occurs
to
me
that
i
am
commanderinchief
of
the
army
and
i
order
you
to
go
inside
why
lincoln
growed
whiskers
perhaps
the
majority
of
people
in
the
united
states
dont
know
why
lincoln
growed
whiskers
after
his
first
nomination
for
the
presidency
before
that
time
his
face
was
clean
shaven
in
the
beautiful
village
of
westfield
chautauqua
county
new
york
there
lived
in
little
grace
bedell
during
the
campaign
of
that
year
she
saw
a
portrait
of
lincoln
for
whom
she
felt
the
love
and
reverence
that
was
common
in
republican
families
and
his
smooth
homely
face
rather
disappointed
her
she
said
to
her
mother
i
think
mother
that
mr
lincoln
would
look
better
if
he
wore
whiskers
and
i
mean
to
write
and
tell
him
so
the
mother
gave
her
permission
graces
father
was
a
republican
her
two
brothers
were
democrats
grace
wrote
at
once
to
the
hon
abraham
lincoln
esq
springfield
illinois
in
which
she
told
him
how
old
she
was
and
where
she
lived
that
she
was
a
republican
that
she
thought
he
would
make
a
good
president
but
would
look
better
if
he
would
let
his
whiskers
grow
if
he
would
do
so
she
would
try
to
coax
her
brothers
to
vote
for
him
she
thought
the
rail
fence
around
the
picture
of
his
cabin
was
very
pretty
if
you
have
not
time
to
answer
my
letter
will
you
allow
your
little
girl
to
reply
for
you
lincoln
was
much
pleased
with
the
letter
and
decided
to
answer
it
which
he
did
at
once
as
follows
springfield
illinois
october
miss
grace
bedell
my
dear
little
miss
your
very
agreeable
letter
of
the
fifteenth
is
received
i
regret
the
necessity
of
saying
i
have
no
daughter
i
have
three
sons
one
seventeen
one
nine
and
one
seven
years
of
age
they
with
their
mother
constitute
my
whole
family
as
to
the
whiskers
having
never
worn
any
do
you
not
think
people
would
call
it
a
piece
of
silly
affectation
if
i
should
begin
it
now
your
very
sincere
wellwisher
a
lincoln
when
on
the
journey
to
washington
to
be
inaugurated
lincolns
train
stopped
at
westfield
he
recollected
his
little
correspondent
and
spoke
of
her
to
exlieutenant
governor
george
w
patterson
who
called
out
and
asked
if
grace
bedell
was
present
there
was
a
large
surging
mass
of
people
gathered
about
the
train
but
grace
was
discovered
at
a
distance
the
crowd
opened
a
pathway
to
the
coach
and
she
came
timidly
but
gladly
to
the
presidentelect
who
told
her
that
she
might
see
that
he
had
allowed
his
whiskers
to
grow
at
her
request
then
reaching
out
his
long
arms
he
drew
her
up
to
him
and
kissed
her
the
act
drew
an
enthusiastic
demonstration
of
approval
from
the
multitude
grace

a
kansas

and

billings
lincoln
as
a
dancer
lincoln
made
his
first
appearance
in
society
when
he
was
first
sent
to
springfield
ill
as
a
member
of
the
state
legislature
it
was
not
an
imposing
figure
which
he
cut
in
a
ballroom
but
still
he
was
occasionally
to
be
found
there
miss
mary
todd
who
afterward
became
his
wife
was
the
magnet
which
drew
the
tall
awkward
young
man
from
his
den
one
evening
lincoln
approached
miss
todd
and
said
in
his
peculiar
idiom
miss
todd
i
should
like
to
dance
with
you
the
worst
way
the
young
woman
accepted
the
inevitable
and
hobbled
around
the
room
with
him
when
she
returned
to
her
seat
one
of
her
companions
asked
mischievously
well
mary
did
he
dance
with
you
the
worst
way
yes
she
answered
the
very
worst
simply
practical
humanity
an
instance
of
young
lincolns
practical
humanity
at
an
early
period
of
his
life
is
recorded
in
this
way
one
evening
while
returning
from
a
raising
in
his
wide
neighborhood
with
a
number
of
companions
he
discovered
a
stray
horse
with
saddle
and
bridle
upon
him
the
horse
was
recognized
as
belonging
to
a
man
who
was
accustomed
to
get
drunk
and
it
was
suspected
at
once
that
he
was
not
far
off
a
short
search
only
was
necessary
to
confirm
the
belief
the
poor
drunkard
was
found
in
a
perfectly
helpless
condition
upon
the
chilly
ground
abrahams
companions
urged
the
cowardly
policy
of
leaving
him
to
his
fate
but
young
lincoln
would
not
hear
to
the
proposition
at
his
request
the
miserable
sot
was
lifted
on
his
shoulders
and
he
actually
carried
him
eighty
rods
to
the
nearest
house
sending
word
to
his
father
that
he
should
not
be
back
that
night
with
the
reason
for
his
absence
he
attended
and
nursed
the
man
until
the
morning
and
had
the
pleasure
of
believing
that
he
had
saved
his
life
happy
figures
of
speech
on
one
occasion
exasperated
at
the
discrepancy
between
the
aggregate
of
troops
forwarded
to
mcclellan
and
the
number
that
same
general
reported
as
having
received
lincoln
exclaimed
sending
men
to
that
army
is
like
shoveling
fleas
across
a
barnyardhalf
of
them
never
get
there
to
a
politician
who
had
criticised
his
course
he
wrote
would
you
have
me
drop
the
war
where
it
is
or
would
you
prosecute
it
in
future
with
elder
stalk
squirts
charged
with
rosewater
when
on
his
first
arrival
in
washington
as
president
he
found
himself
besieged
by
officeseekers
while
the
war
was
breaking
out
he
said
i
feel
like
a
man
letting
lodgings
at
one
end
of
his
house
while
the
other
end
is
on
fire

marshal
of

of

during

time

washington
accompanied
the
president
everywhere
he
was
a
good
singer
and
when
lincoln
was
in
one
of
his
melancholy
moods
would
fire
a
few
rhythmic
shots
at
the
president
to
cheer
the
latter
lincoln
keenly
relished
nonsense
in
the
shape
of
witty
or
comic
ditties
a
parody
of
a
life
on
the
ocean
wave
was
always
pleasing
to
him
oh
a
life
on
the
ocean
wave
and
a
home
on
the
rolling
deep
with
ratlins
fried
three
times
a
day
and

thoughts
of
kind
intent
and
the
raving
bedbug
comes
the
road
the
cockroach
went
lincoln
could
not
control
his
laughter
when
he
heard
songs
of
this
sort
he
was
fond
of
negro
melodies
too
and
the
bluetailed
fly
was
a
great
favorite
with
him
he
often
called
for
that
buzzing
ballad
when
he
and
lamon
were
alone
and
he
wanted
to
throw
off
the
weight
of
public
and
private
cares
the
ballad
of
the
bluetailed
fly
contained
two
verses
which
ran
when
i
was
young
i
used
to
wait
at
massas
table
n
hand
de
plate
an
pass
de
bottle
when
he
was
dry
an
brush
away
de
bluetailed
fly
ol
massas
dead
oh
let
him
rest
dey
say
all
things
am
for
de
best
but
i
cant
forget
until
i
die
ol
massa
an
de
bluetailed
fly
while
humorous
songs
delighted
the
president
he
also
loved
to
listen
to
patriotic
airs
and
ballads
containing
sentiment
he
was
fond
of
hearing
the
sword
of
bunker
hill
ben
bolt
and
the
lament
of
the
irish
emigrant
his
preference
of
the
verses
in
the
latter
was
this
im
lonely
now
mary
for
the
poor
make
no
new
friends
but
oh
they
love
the
better
still
the
few
our
father
sends
and
you
were
all
i
had
mary
my
blessing
and
my
pride
theres
nothing
left
to
care
for
now
since
my
poor
mary
died
those
who
knew
lincoln
were
well
aware
he
was
incapable
of
so
monstrous
an
act
as
that
of
wantonly
insulting
the
dead
as
was
charged
in
the
infamous
libel
which
asserted
that
he
listened
to
a
comic
song
on
the
field
of
antietam
before
the
dead
were
buried
old
man
glenns
religion
mr
lincoln
once
remarked
to
a
friend
that
his
religion
was
like
that
of
an
old
man
named
glenn
in
indiana
whom
he
heard
speak
at
a
church
meeting
and
who
said
when
i
do
good
i
feel
good
when
i
do
bad
i
feel
bad
and
thats
my
religion
mrs
lincoln
herself
has
said
that
mr
lincoln
had
no
faithno
faith
in
the
usual
acceptance
of
those
words
he
never
joined
a
church
but
still
as
i
believe
he
was
a
religious
man
by
nature
he
first
seemed
to
think
about
the
subject
when
our
boy
willie
died
and
then
more
than
ever
about
the
time
he
went
to
gettysburg
but
it
was
a
kind
of
poetry
in
his
nature
and
he
never
was
a
technical
christian
last
acts
of
mercy
during
the
afternoon
preceding
his
assassination
the
president
signed
a
pardon
for
a
soldier
sentenced
to
be
shot
for
desertion
remarking
as
he
did
so
well
i
think
the
boy
can
do
us
more
good
above
ground
than
under
ground
he
also
approved
an
application
for
the
discharge
on
taking
the
oath
of
allegiance
of
a
rebel
prisoner
in
whose
petition
he
wrote
let
it
be
done
this
act
of
mercy
was
his
last
official
order
just
like
seward
the
first
corps
of
the
army
commanded
by
general
reynolds
was
once
reviewed
by
the
president
on
a
beautiful
plain
at
the
north
of
potomac
creek
about
eight
miles
from
hookers
headquarters
the
party
rode
thither
in
an
ambulance
over
a
rough
corduroy
road
and
as
they
passed
over
some
of
the
more
difficult
portions
of
the
jolting
way
the
ambulance
driver
who
sat
well
in
front
occasionally
let
fly
a
volley
of
suppressed
oaths
at
his
wild
team
of
six
mules
finally
mr
lincoln
leaning
forward
touched
the
man
on
the
shoulder
and
said
excuse
me
my
friend
are
you
an
episcopalian
the
man
greatly
startled
looked
around
and
replied
no
mr
president
i
am
a
methodist
well
said
lincoln
i
thought
you
must
be
an
episcopalian
because
you
swear
just
like
governor
seward
who
is
a
church
warder
a
cheerful
prospect
the
first
night
after
the
departure
of
presidentelect
lincoln
from
springfield
on
his
way
to
washington
was
spent
in
indianapolis
governor
yates
o
h
browning
jesse
k
dubois
o
m
hatch
josiah
allen
of
indiana
and
others
after
taking
leave
of
mr
lincoln
to
return
to
their
respective
homes
took
ward
lamon
into
a
room
locked
the
door
and
proceeded
in
the
most
solemn
and
impressive
manner
to
instruct
him
as
to
his
duties
as
the
special
guardian
of
mr
lincolns
person
during
the
rest
of
his
journey
to
washington
lamon
tells
the
story
as
follows
the
lesson
was
concluded
by
uncle
jesse
as
mr
dubois
was
commonly
called
who
said
now
lamon
we
have
regarded
you
as
the
tom
hyer
of
illinois
with
morrissey
attachment
we
intrust
the
sacred
life
of
mr
lincoln
to
your
keeping
and
if
you
dont
protect
it
never
return
to
illinois
for
we
will
murder
you
on
sight
thought
god
would
have
told
him
professor
jonathan
baldwin
turner
was
one
of
the
few
men
to
whom
mr
lincoln
confided
his
intention
to
issue
the
proclamation
of
emancipation
mr
lincoln
told
his
illinois
friend
of
the
visit
of
a
delegation
to
him
who
claimed
to
have
a
message
from
god
that
the
war
would
not
be
successful
without
the
freeing
of
the
negroes
to
whom
mr
lincoln
replied
is
it
not
a
little
strange
that
he
should
tell
this
to
you
who
have
so
little
to
do
with
it
and
should
not
have
told
me
who
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
at
the
same
time
he
informed
professor
turner
he
had
his
proclamation
in
his
pocket
lincoln
and
a
bible
hero
a
writer
who
heard
mr
lincolns
famous
speech
delivered
in
new
york
after
his
nomination
for
president
has
left
this
record
of
the
event
when
lincoln
rose
to
speak
i
was
greatly
disappointed
he
was
tall
tall
oh
so
tall
and
so
angular
and
awkward
that
i
had
for
an
instant
a
feeling
of
pity
for
so
ungainly
a
man
he
began
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
as
if
he
were
used
to
speaking
out
of
doors
and
was
afraid
of
speaking
too
loud
he
said
mr
cheerman
instead
of
mr
chairman
and
employed
many
other
words
with
an
oldfashioned
pronunciation
i
said
to
myself
old
fellow
you
wont
do
it
is
all
very
well
for
the
wild
west
but
this
will
never
go
down
in
new
york
but
pretty
soon
he
began
to
get
into
the
subject
he
straightened
up
made
regular
and
graceful
gestures
his
face
lighted
as
with
an
inward
fire
the
whole
man
was
transfigured
i
forgot
the
clothing
his
personal
appearance
and
his
individual
peculiarities
presently
forgetting
myself
i
was
on
my
feet
with
the
rest
yelling
like
a
wild
indian
cheering
the
wonderful
man
in
the
close
parts
of
his
argument
you
could
hear
the
gentle
sizzling
of
the
gas
burners
when
he
reached
a
climax
the
thunders
of
applause
were
terrific
it
was
a
great
speech
when
i
came
out
of
the
hall
my
face
was
glowing
with
excitement
and
my
frame
all
aquiver
a
friend
with
his
eyes
aglow
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
abe
lincoln
the
railsplitter
i
said
hes
the
greatest
man
since
st
paul
and
i
think
so
yet
boy
was
cared
for
president
lincoln
one
day
noticed
a
small
pale
delicatelooking
boy
about
thirteen
years
old
among
the
number
in
the
white
house
antechamber
the
president
saw
him
standing
there
looking
so
feeble
and
faint
and
said
come
here
my
boy
and
tell
me
what
you
want
the
boy
advanced
placed
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
presidents
chair
and
with
a
bowed
head
and
timid
accents
said
mr
president
i
have
been
a
drummer
boy
in
a
regiment
for
two
years
and
my
colonel
got
angry
with
me
and
turned
me
off
i
was
taken
sick
and
have
been
a
long
time
in
the
hospital
the
president
discovered
that
the
boy
had
no
home
no
fatherhe
had
died
in
the
armyno
mother
i
have
no
father
no
mother
no
brothers
no
sisters
and
bursting
into
tears
no
friendsnobody
cares
for
me
lincolns
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
the
boys
heart
was
soon
made
glad
by
a
request
to
certain
officials
to
care
for
this
poor
boy
the
jury
acquitted
him
one
of
the
most
noted
murder
cases
in
which
lincoln
defended
the
accused
was
tried
in
august
the
victim
crafton
was
a
student
in
his
own
law
office
the
defendant
peachy
harrison
was
a
grandson
of
rev
peter
cartwright
both
were
connected
with
the
best
families
in
the
county
they
were
brothersinlaw
and
had
always
been
friends
senator
john
m
palmer
and
general
john
a
mcclelland
were
on
the
side
of
the
prosecution
among
those
who
represented
the
defendant
were
lincoln
and
senator
shelby
m
cullom
the
two
young
men
had
engaged
in
a
political
quarrel
and
crafton
was
stabbed
to
death
by
harrison
the
tragic
pathos
of
a
case
which
involved
the
deepest
affections
of
almost
an
entire
community
reached
its
climax
in
the
appearance
in
court
of
the
venerable
peter
cartwright
lincoln
had
beaten
him
for
congress
in
eccentric
and
aggressive
as
he
was
he
was
honored
far
and
wide
and
when
he
arose
to
take
the
witness
stand
his
white
hair
crowned
with
this
cruel
sorrow
the
most
indifferent
spectator
felt
that
his
examination
would
be
unbearable
it
fell
to
lincoln
to
question
cartwright
with
the
rarest
gentleness
he
began
to
put
his
questions
how
long
have
you
known
the
prisoner
cartwrights
head
dropped
on
his
breast
for
a
moment
then
straightening
himself
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
and
answered
in
a
deep
quavering
voice
i
have
known
him
since
a
babe
he
laughed
and
cried
on
my
knee
the
examination
ended
by
lincoln
drawing
from
the
witness
the
story
of
how
crafton
had
said
to
him
just
before
his
death
i
am
dying
i
will
soon
part
with
all
i
love
on
earth
and
i
want
you
to
say
to
my
slayer
that
i
forgive
him
i
want
to
leave
this
earth
with
a
forgiveness
of
all
who
have
in
any
way
injured
me
this
examination
made
a
profound
impression
on
the
jury
lincoln
closed
his
argument
by
picturing
the
scene
anew
appealing
to
the
jury
to
practice
the
same
forgiving
spirit
that
the
murdered
man
had
shown
on
his
deathbed
it
was
undoubtedly
to
his
handling
of
the
grandfathers
evidence
that
harrisons
acquittal
was
due
took
nothing
but
money
during
the
war
congress
appropriated
to
be
expended
by
the
president
in
defending
united
states
marshals
in
cases
of
arrests
and
seizures
where
the
legality
of
their
actions
was
tested
in
the
courts
previously
the
marshals
sought
the
assistance
of
the
attorneygeneral
in
defending
them
but
when
they
found
that
the
president
had
a
fund
for
that
purpose
they
sought
to
control
the
money
in
speaking
of
these
marshals
one
day
mr
lincoln
said
they
are
like
a
man
in
illinois
whose
cabin
was
burned
down
and
according
to
the
kindly
custom
of
early
days
in
the
west
his
neighbors
all
contributed
something
to
start
him
again
in
his
case
they
had
been
so
liberal
that
he
soon
found
himself
better
off
than
before
the
fire
and
he
got
proud
one
day
a
neighbor
brought
him
a
bag
of
oats
but
the
fellow
refused
it
with
scorn
no
said
he
im
not
taking
oats
now
i
take
nothing
but
money
naughty
boy
had
to
take
his
medicine
the
resistance
to
the
military
draft
of
by
the
city
of
new
york
the
result
of
which
was
the
killing
of
several
thousand
persons
was
illustrated
on
august
th
by
frank
leslies
illustrated
newspaper
over
the
title
of
the
naughty
boy
gotham
who
would
not
take
the

was
also
the
text
mammy

there
now
you
bad

way
when
your
little
sister

takes
hers
like

then
governor
of

and
a
prominent

is
a
failure
advocate
he
was
in
albany
the
state
capital
when
the
riots
broke
out
in
the
city
of
new
york
july
th
and
after
the
mob
had
burned
the
colored
orphan
asylum
and
killed
several
hundred
negroes
came
to
the
city
he
had
only
soft
words
for
the
rioters
promising
them
that
the
draft
should
be
suspended
then
the
government
sent
several
regiments
of
veterans
fresh
from
the
field
of
gettysburg
where
they
had
assisted
in
defeating
lee
these
troops
made
short
work
of
the
brutal
ruffians
shooting
down
three
thousand
or
so
of
them
and
the
rioting
was
subdued
the
naughty
boy
gotham
had
to
take
his
medicine
after
all
but
as
the
spirit
of
opposition
to
the
war
was
still
rampant
the
president
issued
a
proclamation
suspending
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
all
the
states
of
the
union
where
the
government
had
control
this
had
a
quieting
effect
upon
those
who
were
doing
what
they
could
in
obstructing
the
government
would
blow
them
to
h
mr
lincoln
had
advised
lieutenantgeneral

commanding
the
united
states
army
of
the
threats
of
violence
on
inauguration
day
general
scott
was
sick
in

at
washington
when
adjutantgeneral
thomas
mather
of
illinois
called
upon
him
in
presidentelect
lincolns
behalf
and
the
veteran
commander
was
much
wrought
up

if
any
of
them
show
their
heads
or
raise
a
finger
ill
blow
them
to
h
yankee
goodness
of
heart
one
day
when
the
president
was
with
the
troops
who
were
fighting
at
the
front
the
wounded
both
union
and
confederate
began
to
pour
in
as
one
stretcher
was
passing
lincoln
he
heard
the
voice
of
a
lad
calling
to
his
mother
in
agonizing
tones
his
great
heart
filled
he
forgot
the
crisis
of
the
hour
stopping
the
carriers
he
knelt
and
bending
over
him
asked
what
can
i
do
for
you
my
poor
child
oh
you
will
do
nothing
for
me
he
replied
you
are
a
yankee
i
cannot
hope
that
my
message
to
my
mother
will
ever
reach
her
lincoln
in
tears
his
voice
full
of
tenderest
love
convinced
the
boy
of
his
sincerity
and
he
gave
his
goodbye
words
without
reserve
the
president
directed
them
copied
and
ordered
that
they
be
sent
that
night
with
a
flag
of
truce
into
the
enemys
lines
walked
as
he
talked
when
mr
lincoln
made
his
famous
humorous
speech
in
congress
ridiculing
general
cass
he
began
to
speak
from
notes
but
as
he
warmed
up
he
left
his
desk
and
his
notes
to
stride
down
the
alley
toward
the
speakers
chair
occasionally
as
he
would
complete
a
sentence
amid
shouts
of
laughter
he
would
return
up
the
alley
to
his
desk
consult
his
notes
take
a
sip
of
water
and
start
off
again
mr
lincoln
received
many
congratulations
at
the
close
democrats
joining
the
whigs
in
their
complimentary
comments

cornjuice
from
old
abe
when
he
lived
at
salem
it
was
here
that
anne
rutledge
dwelt
and
in
whose
grave
lincoln
wrote
that
his
heart
was
buried
as
the
story
runs
the
fair
and
gentle
anne
was
originally
john
mcnamers
sweetheart
but
abe
took
a
shine
to
the
young
lady
and
succeeded
in
heading
off
mcnamer
and
won
her
affections
but
anne
rutledge
died
and
lincoln
went
to
springfield
where
he
some
time
afterwards
married
it
is
related
that
during
the
war
a
lady
belonging
to
a
prominent
kentucky
family
visited
washington
to
beg
for
her
sons
pardon
who
was
then
in
prison
under
sentence
of
death
for
belonging
to
a
band
of
guerrillas
who
had
committed
many
murders
and
outrages
with
the
mother
was
her
daughter
a
beautiful
young
lady
who
was
an
accomplished
musician
mr
lincoln
received
the
visitors
in
his
usual
kind
manner
and
the
mother
made
known
the
object
of
her
visit
accompanying
her
plea
with
tears
and
sobs
and
all
the
customary
romantic
incidents
there
were
probably
extenuating
circumstances
in
favor
of
the
young
rebel
prisoner
and
while
the
president
seemed
to
be
deeply
pondering
the
young
lady
moved
to
a
piano
near
by
and
taking
a
seat
commenced
to
sing
gentle
annie
a
very
sweet
and
pathetic
ballad
which
before
the
war
was
a
familiar
song
in
almost
every
household
in
the
union
and
is
not
yet
entirely
forgotten
for
that
matter
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
young
lady
sang
the
song
with
more
plaintiveness
and
effect
than
old
abe
had
ever
heard
it
in
springfield
during
its
rendition
he
arose
from
his
seat
crossed
the
room
to
a
window
in
the
westward
through
which
he
gazed
for
several
minutes
with
a
sad
faraway
look
which
has
so
often
been
noted
as
one
of
his
peculiarities
his
memory
no
doubt
went
back
to
the
days
of
his
humble
life
on
the
sangamon
and
with
visions
of
old
salem
and
its
rustic
people
who
once
gathered
in
his
primitive
store
came
a
picture
of
the
gentle
annie
of
his
youth
whose
ashes
had
rested
for
many
long
years
under
the
wild
flowers
and
brambles
of
the
old
rural
buryingground
but
whose
spirit
then
perhaps
guided
him
to
the
side
of
mercy
be
that
as
it
may
president
lincoln
drew
a
large
red
silk
handkerchief
from
his
coatpocket
with
which
he
wiped
his
face
vigorously
then
he
turned
advanced
quickly
to
his
desk
wrote
a
brief
note
which
he
handed
to
the
lady
and
informed
her
that
it
was
the
pardon
she
sought
the
scene
was
no
doubt
touching
in
a
great
degree
and
proves
that
a
nice
song
well
sung
has
often
a
powerful
influence
in
recalling
tender
recollections
it
proves
also
that
abraham
lincoln
was
a
man
of
fine
feelings
and
that
if
the
occurrence
was
a
putup
job
on
the
ladys
part
it
accomplished
the
purpose
all
the
same
a
free
for
all
lincoln
made
a
political
speech
at
pappsville
illinois
when
a
candidate
for
the
legislature
the
first
time
a
freeforall
fight
began
soon
after
the
opening
of
the
meeting
and
lincoln
noticing
one
of
his
friends
about
to
succumb
to
the
energetic
attack
of
an
infuriated
ruffian
edged
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
seizing
the
bully
by
the
neck
and
the
seat
of
his
trousers
threw
him
by
means
of
his
strength
and
long
arms
as
one
witness
stoutly
insists
twelve
feet
away
returning
to
the
stand
and
throwing
aside
his
hat
he
inaugurated
his
campaign
with
the
following
brief
but
pertinent
declaration
fellowcitizens
i
presume
you
all
know
who
i
am
i
am
humble
abraham
lincoln
i
have
been
solicited
by
many
friends
to
become
a
candidate
for
the
legislature
my
politics
are
short
and
sweet
like
the
old
womans
dance
i
am
in
favor
of
the
national
bank
i
am
in
favor
of
the
internal
improvement
system
and
a
high
protective
tariff
these
are
my
sentiments
if
elected
i
shall
be
thankful
if
not
it
will
be
all
the
same
three
infernal
bores
one
day
when
president
lincoln
was
alone
and
busily
engaged
on
an
important
subject
involving
vexation
and
anxiety
he
was
disturbed
by
the
unwarranted
intrusion
of
three
men
who
without
apology
proceeded
to
lay
their
claim
before
him
the
spokesman
of
the
three
reminded
the
president
that
they
were
the
owners
of
some
torpedo
or
other
warlike
invention
which
if
the
government
would
only
adopt
it
would
soon
crush
the
rebellion
now
said
the
spokesman
we
have
been
here
to
see
you
time
and
again
you
have
referred
us
to
the
secretary
of
war
the
chief
of
ordnance
and
the
general
of
the
army
and
they
give
us
no
satisfaction
we
have
been
kept
here
waiting
till
money
and
patience
are
exhausted
and
we
now
come
to
demand
of
you
a
final
reply
to
our
application
mr
lincoln
listened
to
this
insolent
tirade
and
at
its
close
the
old
twinkle
came
into
his
eye
you
three
gentlemen
remind
me
of
a
story
i
once
heard
said
he
of
a
poor
little
boy
out
west
who
had
lost
his
mother
his
father
wanted
to
give
him
a
religious
education
and
so
placed
him
in
the
family
of
a
clergyman
whom
he
directed
to
instruct
the
little
fellow
carefully
in
the
scriptures
every
day
the
boy
had
to
commit
to
memory
and
recite
one
chapter
of
the
bible
things
proceeded
smoothly
until
they
reached
that
chapter
which
details
the
story
of
the
trial
of
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
in
the
fiery
furnace
when
asked
to
repeat
these
three
names
the
boy
said
he
had
forgotten
them
his
teacher
told
him
that
he
must
learn
them
and
gave
him
another
day
to
do
so
the
next
day
the
boy
again
forgot
them
now
said
the
teacher
you
have
again
failed
to
remember
those
names
and
you
can
go
no
farther
until
you
have
learned
them
i
will
give
you
another
day
on
this
lesson
and
if
you
dont
repeat
the
names
i
will
punish
you
a
third
time
the
boy
came
to
recite
and
got
down
to
the
stumbling
block
when
the
clergyman
said
now
tell
me
the
names
of
the
men
in
the
fiery
furnace
oh
said
the
boy
here
come
those
three
infernal
bores
i
wish
the
devil
had
them
having
received
their
final
answer
the
three
patriots
retired
and
at
the
cabinet
meeting
which
followed
the
president
in
high
good
humor
related
how
he
had
dismissed
his
unwelcome
visitors
lincolns
men
were
hustlers
in
the
chicago
convention
of
the
fight
for
seward
was
maintained
with
desperate
resolve
until
the
final
ballot
was
taken
thurlow
weed
was
the
seward
leader
and
he
was
simply
incomparable
as
a
master
in
handling
a
convention
with
him
were
governor
morgan
henry
j
raymond
of
the
new
york
times
with
william
m
evarts
as
chairman
of
the
new
york
delegation
whose
speech
nominating
seward
was
the
most
impressive
utterance
of
his
life
the
bates
men
bates
was
afterwards
lincolns
attorneygeneral
were
led
by
frank
blair
the
only
republican
congressman
from
a
slave
state
who
was
nothing
if
not
heroic
aided
by
his
brother
montgomery
afterwards
lincolns
postmaster
general
who
was
a
politician
of
uncommon
cunning
with
them
was
horace
greeley
who
was
chairman
of
the
delegation
from
the
then
almost
inaccessible
state
of
oregon
it
was
lincolns
friends
however
who
were
the
hustlers
of
that
battle
they
had
men
for
sober
counsel
like
david
davis
men
of
supreme
sagacity
like
leonard
swett
men
of
tireless
effort
like
norman
b
judd
and
they
had
what
was
more
important
than
alla
seething
multitude
wild
with
enthusiasm
for
old
abe
a
slow
horse
on
one
occasion
when
mr
lincoln
was
going
to
attend
a
political
convention
one
of
his
rivals
a
liveryman
provided
him
with
a
slow
horse
hoping
that
he
would
not
reach
his
destination
in
time
mr
lincoln
got
there
however
and
when
he
returned
with
the
horse
he
said
you
keep
this
horse
for
funerals
dont
you
oh
no
replied
the
liveryman
well
im
glad
of
that
for
if
you
did
youd
never
get
a
corpse
to
the
grave
in
time
for
the
resurrection
dodging
browsing
presidents
general
mcclellan
after
being
put
in
command
of
the
army
resented
any
interference
by
the
president
lincoln
in
his
anxiety
to
know
the
details
of
the
work
in
the
army
went
frequently
to
mcclellans
headquarters
that
the
president
had
a
serious
purpose
in
these
visits
mcclellan
did
not
see
i
enclose
a
card
just
received
from
a
lincoln
he
wrote
to
his
wife
one
day
it
shows
too
much
deference
to
be
seen
outside
in
another
letter
to
mrs
mcclellan
he
spoke
of
being
interrupted
by
the
president
and
secretary
seward
who
had
nothing
in
particular
to
say
and
again
of
concealing
himself
to
dodge
all
enemies
in
shape
of
browsing
presidents
etc
i
am
becoming
daily
more
disgusted
with
this
administrationperfectly
sick
of
it
he
wrote
early
in
october
and
a
few
days
later
i
was
obliged
to
attend
a
meeting
of
the
cabinet
at
p
m
and
was
bored
and
annoyed
there
are
some
of
the
greatest
geese
in
the
cabinet
i
have
ever
seenenough
to
tax
the
patience
of
job
a
greenback
legend
at
a
cabinet
meeting
once
the
advisability
of
putting
a
legend
on
greenbacks
similar
to
the
in
god
we
trust
legend
on
the
silver
coins
was
discussed
and
the
president
was
asked
what
his
view
was
he
replied
if
you
are
going
to
put
a
legend
on
the
greenback
i
would
suggest
that
of
peter
and
paul
silver
and
gold
we
have
not
but
what
we
have
well
give
you
gods
best
gift
to
man
one
of
mr
lincolns
notable
religious
utterances
was
his
reply
to
a
deputation
of
colored
people
at
baltimore
who
presented
him
a
bible
he
said
in
regard
to
the
great
book
i
have
only
to
say
it
is
the
best
gift
which
god
has
ever
given
man
all
the
good
from
the
savior
of
the
world
is
communicated
to
us
through
this
book
but
for
this
book
we
could
not
know
right
from
wrong
all
those
things
desirable
to
man
are
contained
in
it
scalping
in
the
black
hawk
war
when
lincoln
was
president
he
told
this
story
of
the
black
hawk
war
the
only
time
he
ever
saw
blood
in
this
campaign
was
one
morning
when
marching
up
a
little
valley
that
makes
into
the
rock
river
bottom
to
reinforce
a
squad
of
outposts
that
were
thought
to
be
in
danger
they
came
upon
the
tent
occupied
by
the
other
party
just
at
sunrise
the
men
had
neglected
to
place
any
guard
at
night
and
had
been
slaughtered
in
their
sleep
as
the
reinforcing
party
came
up
the
slope
on
which
the
camp
had
been
made
lincoln
saw
them
all
lying
with
their
heads
towards
the
rising
sun
and
the
round
red
spot
that
marked
where
they
had
been
scalped
gleamed
more
redly
yet
in
the
ruddy
light
of
the
sun
this
scene
years
afterwards
he
recalled
with
a
shudder
matrimonial
advice
for
a
while
during
the
civil
war
general
fremont
was
without
a
command
one
day
in
discussing
fremonts
case
with
george
w
julian
president
lincoln
said
he
did
not
know
where
to
place
him
and
that
it
reminds
him
of
the
old
man
who
advised
his
son
to
take
a
wife
to
which
the
young
man
responded
all
right
whose
wife
shall
i
take
owed
lots
of
money
on
april
a
few
hours
previous
to
his
assassination
president
lincoln
sent
a
message
by
congressman
schuyler
colfax
vicepresident
during
general
grants
first
term
to
the
miners
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
regions
bounded
by
the
pacific
ocean
in
which
he
said
now
that
the
rebellion
is
overthrown
and
we
know
pretty
nearly
the
amount
of
our
national
debt
the
more
gold
and
silver
we
mine
we
make
the
payment
of
that
debt
so
much
easier
now
i
am
going
to
encourage
that
in
every
possible
way
we
shall
have
hundreds
of
thousands
of
disbanded
soldiers
and
many
have
feared
that
their
return
home
in
such
great
numbers
might
paralyze
industry
by
furnishing
suddenly
a
greater
supply
of
labor
than
there
will
be
demand
for
i
am
going
to
try
to
attract
them
to
the
hidden
wealth
of
our
mountain
ranges
where
there
is
room
enough
for
all
immigration
which
even
the
war
has
not
stopped
will
land
upon
our
shores
hundreds
of
thousands
more
per
year
from
overcrowded
europe
i
intend
to
point
them
to
the
gold
and
silver
that
wait
for
them
in
the
west
tell
the
miners
for
me
that
i
shall
promote
their
interests
to
the
utmost
of
my
ability
because
their
prosperity
as
the
prosperity
of
the
nation
and
said
he
his
eye
kindling
with
enthusiasm
we
shall
prove
in
a
very
few
years
that
we
are
indeed
the
treasury
of
the
world
on
the
lords
side
president
lincoln
made
a
significant
remark
to
a
clergyman
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
let
us
have
faith
mr
president
said
the
minister
that
the
lord
is
on
our
side
in
this
great
struggle
mr
lincoln
quietly
answered
i
am
not
at
all
concerned
about
that
for
i
know
that
the
lord
is
always
on
the
side
of
the
right
but
it
is
my
constant
anxiety
and
prayer
that
i
and
this
nation
may
be
on
the
lords
side
wanted
to
be
near
abe
it
was
lincolns
custom
to
hold
an
informal
reception
once
a
week
each
caller
taking
his
turn
upon
one
of
these
eventful
days
an
old
friend
from
illinois
stood
in
line
for
almost
an
hour
at
last
he
was
so
near
the
president
his
voice
could
reach
him
and
calling
out
to
his
old
associate
he
startled
every
one
by
exclaiming
hallo
abe
how
are
ye
im
in
line
and
hev
come
for
an
orfice
too
lincoln
singled
out
the
man
with
the
stentorian
voice
and
recognizing
a
particularly
old
friend
one
whose
wife
had
befriended
him
at
a
peculiarly
trying
time
the
president
responded
to
his
greeting
in
a
cordial
manner
and
told
him
to
hang
onto
himself
and
not
kick
the
traces
keep
in
line
and
youll
soon
get
here
they
met
and
shook
hands
with
the
old
fervor
and
renewed
their
friendship
the
informal
reception
over
lincoln
sent
for
his
old
friend
and
the
latter
began
to
urge
his
claims
after
having
given
him
some
good
advice
lincoln
kindly
told
him
he
was
incapable
of
holding
any
such
position
as
he
asked
for
the
disappointment
of
the
illinois
friend
was
plainly
shown
and
with
a
perceptible
tremor
in
his
voice
he
said
marthas
dead
the
gal
is
married
and
ive
guv
jim
the
forty
then
looking
at
lincoln
he
came
a
little
nearer
and
almost
whispered
i
knowed
i
wasnt
eddicated
enough
to
git
the
place
but
i
kinder
want
to
stay
where
i
ken
see
abe
lincoln
he
was
given
employment
in
the
white
house
grounds
afterwards
the
president
said
these
brief
interviews
stripped
of
even
the
semblance
of
ceremony
give
me
a
better
insight
into
the
real
character
of
the
person

his
true
reason
for
seeking

six
months
after

had
made
his
divided
house
speech
delivered
an
address
at
rochester
new
york
containing
this
famous
sentence
it
is
an
irrepressible
conflict
between
opposing
and
enduring
forces
and
it
means
that
the
united
states
must
and
will
sooner
or
later
become
either

a

nation
or
entirely
a
freelabor
nation
seward

had
simply
followed

lincolns
steps
was
defeated
for
the
presidential
nomination
at
the
republican

he
was
too
radical

was
still
radicaler

whig
the
world
knows
the
result
lincoln
was
elected
it
is
not
so
much
his
election
as
the
manner
in
which
he
secured
his
nomination
with
which
we
have
to
deal
before
that
evermemorable
spring
lincoln
vacillated
between
the
courts
of
springfield
rated
as
a
plain
honest
logical
whig
with
no
ambition
higher
politically
than
to
occupy
some
good
home
office
late
in
the
fall
of
his
name
began
to
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
congressional
aspirations
which
fact
greatly
annoyed
the
leaders
of
his
political
party
who
had
already
selected
as
the
whig
candidate
e
d
baker
afterward
the
gallant
colonel
who
fell
so
bravely
and
died
such
an
honorable
death
on
the
battlefield
of
balls
bluff
despite
all
efforts
of
his
opponents
within
his
party
the
name
of
the
gaunt
railsplitter
was
hailed
with
acclaim
by
the
masses
to
whom
he
had
endeared
himself
by
his
witticisms
honest
tongue
and
quaint
philosophy
when
on
the
stump
or
mingling
with
them
in
their
homes
the
convention
which
met
in
early
spring
in
the
city
of
springfield
was
to
be
composed
of
the
usual
number
of
delegates
the
contest
for
the
nomination
was
spirited
and
exciting
a
few
weeks
before
the
meeting
of
the
convention
the
fact
was
found
by
the
leaders
that
the
advantage
lay
with
lincoln
and
that
unless
they
pulled
some
very
fine
wires
nothing
could
save
baker
they
attempted
to
play
the
game
that
has
so
often
won
by
convincing
delegates
under
instructions
for
lincoln
to
violate
them
and
vote
for
baker
they
had
apparently
succeeded
the
best
laid
plans
of
mice
and
men
gang
aft
agley
so
it
was
in
this
case
two
days
before
the
convention
lincoln
received
an
intimation
of
this
and
late
at
night
wrote
the
following
letter
the
letter
was
addressed
to
martin
morris
who
resided
at
petersburg
an
intimate
friend
of
his
and
by
him
circulated
among
those
who
were
instructed
for
him
at
the
county
convention
it
had
the
desired
effect
the
convention
met
the
scheme
of
the
conspirators
miscarried
lincoln
was
nominated
made
a
vigorous
canvass
and
was
triumphantly
elected
thus
paving
the
way
for
his
more
extended
and
brilliant
conquests
this
letter
lincoln
had
often
told
his
friends
gave
him
ultimately
the
chief
magistracy
of
the
nation
he
has
also
said
that
had
he
been
beaten
before
the
convention
he
would
have
been
forever
obscured
the
following
is
a
verbatim
copy
of
the
epistle
april
friend
morris
i
have
heard
it
intimated
that
baker
is
trying
to
get
you
or
miles
or
both
of
you
to
violate
the
instructions
of
the
meeting
that
appointed
you
and
to
go
for
him
i
have
insisted
and
still
insist
that
this
cannot
be
true
sure
baker
would
not
do
the
like
as
well
might
hardin
ask
me
to
vote
for
him
in
the
convention
again
it
is
said
there
will
be
an
attempt
to
get
instructions
in
your
county
requiring
you
to
go
for
baker
this
is
all
wrong
upon
the
same
rule
why
might
i
not
fly
from
the
decision
against
me
at
sangamon
and
get
up
instructions
to
their
delegates
to
go
for
me
there
are
at
least
whigs
in
the
county
that
took
no
part
and
yet
i
would
as
soon
stick
my
head
in
the
fire
as
attempt
it
besides
if
any
one
should
get
the
nomination
by
such
extraordinary
means
all
harmony
in
the
district
would
inevitably
be
lost
honest
whigs
and
very
nearly
all
of
them
are
honest
would
not
quietly
abide
such
enormities
i
repeat
such
an
attempt
on
bakers
part
cannot
be
true

springfield

the

a
lincoln
mr
morris
did
show
the
letter
and
mr
lincoln
always
thanked
his
stars
that
he
did
his
favorite
poem
mr
lincolns
favorite
poem
was
oh
why
should
the

of

written
by
william
knox
a
scotchman
although
mr
lincoln
never
knew
the
authors

he
once
said
to
a
friend
this
poem
has
been
a
great
favorite
with
me
for
years
it
was
first
shown
to
me
when
a
young
man
by
a
friend
i
afterward
saw
it
and
cut
it
from
a
newspaper
and
learned
it
by
heart
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
know
who
wrote
it
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
oh
why
should
the
spirit
of

be

president
lincoln
had
great
doubt
as
to
his
right
to
emancipate
the
slaves
under
the
war
power
in
discussing
the
question
he
used
to
like
the
case
to
that
of
the
boy
who
when
asked
how
many
legs
his
calf
would
have
if
he
called

the

a
stagecoach
story
the
following
is
told
by
thomas
h
nelson
of
terre
haute
indiana
who
was
appointed
minister
to
chili
by
lincoln
judge
abram
hammond
afterwards
governor
of
indiana
and
myself
arranged
to
go
from
terre
haute
to
indianapolis
in
a
stagecoach
as
we
stepped
in
we
discovered
that
the
entire
back
seat
was
occupied
by
a
long
lank
individual
whose
head
seemed
to
protrude
from
one
end
of
the
coach
and
his
feet
from
the
other
he
was
the
sole
occupant
and
was
sleeping
soundly
hammond
slapped
him
familiarly
on
the
shoulder
and
asked
him
if
he
had
chartered
the
coach
that
day
certainly
not
and
he
at
once
took
the
front
seat
politely
giving
us
the
place
of
honor
and
comfort
an
oddlooking
fellow
he
was
with
a
twentyfive
cent
hat
without
vest
or
cravat
regarding
him
as
a
good
subject
for
merriment
we
perpetrated
several
jokes
he
took
them
all
with
utmost
innocence
and
good
nature
and
joined
in
the
laugh
although
at
his
own
expense
after
an
astounding
display
of
wordy
pyrotechnics
the
dazed
and
bewildered
stranger
asked
what
will
be
the
upshot
of
this
comet
business
late
in
the
evening
we
reached
indianapolis
and
hurried
to
brownings
hotel
losing
sight
of
the
stranger
altogether
we
retired
to
our
room
to
brush
our
clothes
in
a
few
minutes
i
descended
to
the
portico
and
there
descried
our
long
gloomy
fellow
traveler
in
the
center
of
an
admiring
group
of
lawyers
among
whom
were
judges
mclean
and
huntington
albert
s
white
and
richard
w
thompson
who
seemed
to
be
amused
and
interested
in
a
story
he
was
telling
i
inquired
of
browning
the
landlord
who
he
was
abraham
lincoln
of
illinois
a
member
of
congress
was
his
response
i
was
thunderstruck
at
the
announcement
i
hastened
upstairs
and
told
hammond
the
startling
news
and
together
we
emerged
from
the
hotel
by
a
back
door
and
went
down
an
alley
to
another
house
thus
avoiding
further
contact
with
our
distinguished
fellow
traveler
years
afterward
when
the
presidentelect
was
on
his
way
to
washington
i
was
in
the
same
hotel
looking
over
the
distinguished
party
when
a
long
arm
reached
to
my
shoulder
and
a
shrill
voice
exclaimed
hello
nelson
do
you
think
after
all
the
whole
world
is
going
to
follow
the
darned
thing
off
the
words
were
my
own
in
answer
to
his
question
in
the
stagecoach
the
speaker
was
abraham
lincoln
the
gathered
there
lincoln
had
periods
while
clerking
in
the
new
salem
grocery
store
during
which
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
and
was
therefore
in
circumstances
that
made
laziness
almost
inevitable
had
people
come
to
him
for
goods
they
would
have
found
him
willing
to
sell
them
he
sold
all
that
he
could
doubtless
the
store
soon
became
the
social
center
of
the
village
if
the
people
did
not
care
or
were
unable
to
buy
goods
they
liked
to
go
where
they
could
talk
with
their
neighbors
and
listen
to
stories
these
lincoln
gave
them
in
abundance
and
of
a
rare
sort
it
was
in
these
gatherings
of
the
four
hundred
at
the
village
store
that
lincoln
got
his
training
as
a
debater
public
questions
were
discussed
there
daily
and
nightly
and
lincoln
always
took
a
prominent
part
in
the
discussions
many
of
the
debaters
came
to
consider
abe
linkin
as
about
the
smartest
man
in
the
village
only
levelheaded
men
wanted
lincoln
wanted
men
of
level
heads
for
important
commands
not
infrequently
he
gave
his
generals
advice
he
appreciated
hookers
bravery
dash
and
activity
but
was
fearful
of
the
results
of
what
he
denominated
swashing
around
this
was
one
of
his
telegrams
to
hooker
and
now
beware
of
rashness
beware
of
rashness
but
with
energy
and
sleepless
vigilance
go
forward
and
give
us
victories
his
faith
in
the
monitor
when
the
confederate
ironclad
merrimac
was
sent
against
the
union
vessels
in
hampton
roads
president
lincoln
expressed
his
belief
in
the
monitor
to
captain
fox
the
adviser
of
captain
ericsson
who
constructed
the
monitor
we
have
three
of
the
most
effective
vessels
in
hampton
roads
and
any
number
of
small
craft
that
will
hang
on
the
stern
of
the
merrimac
like
small
dogs
on
the
haunches
of
a
bear
they
may
not
be
able
to
tear
her
down
but
they
will
interfere
with
the
comfort
of
her
voyage
her
trial
trip
will
not
be
a
pleasure
trip
i
am
certain
we
have
had
a
big
share
of
bad
luck
already
but
i
do
not
believe
the
future
has
any
such
misfortunes
in
store
for
us
as
you
anticipate
said
captain
fox
if
the
merrimac
does
not
sink
our
ships
who
is
to
prevent
her
from
dropping
her
anchor
in
the
potomac
where
that
steamer
lies
pointing
to
a
steamer
at
anchor
below
the
long
bridge
and
throwing
her
hundredpound
shells
into
this
room
or
battering
down
the
walls
of
the
capitol
the
almighty
captain
answered
the
president
excitedly
but
without
the
least
affectation
i
expect
setbacks
defeats
we
have
had
them
and
shall
have
them
they
are
common
to
all
wars
but
i
have
not
the
slightest
fear
of
any
result
which
shall
fatally
impair
our
military
and
naval
strength
or
give
other
powers
any
right
to
interfere
in
our
quarrel
the
destruction
of
the
capitol
would
do
both
i
do
not
fear
it
for
this
is
gods
fight
and
he
will
win
it
in
his
own
good
time
he
will
take
care
that
our
enemies
will
not
push
us
too
far
speaking
of
ironclads
said
the
president
you
do
not
seem
to
take
the
little
monitor
into
account
i
believe
in
the
monitor
and
her
commander
if
captain
worden
does
not
give
a
good
account
of
the
monitor
and
of
himself
i
shall
have
made
a
mistake
in
following
my
judgment
for
the
first
time
since
i
have
been
here
captain
i
have
not
made
a
mistake
in
following
my
clear
judgment
of
men
since
this
war
began
i
followed
that
judgment
when
i
gave
worden
the
command
of
the
monitor
i
would
make
the
appointment
over
again
today
the
monitor
should
be
in
hampton
roads
now
she
left
new
york
eight
days
ago
after
the
captain
had
again
presented
what
he
considered
the
possibilities
of
failure
the
president
replied
no
no
captain
i
respect
your
judgments
as
you
have
reason
to
know
but
this
time
you
are
all
wrong
the
monitor
was
one
of
my
inspirations
i
believed
in
her
firmly
when
that
energetic
contractor
first
showed
me
ericssons
plans
captain
ericssons
plain
but
rather
enthusiastic
demonstration
made
my
conversion
permanent
it
was
called
a
floating
battery
then
i
called
it
a
raft
i
caught
some
of
the
inventors
enthusiasm
and
it
has
been
growing
upon
me
i
thought
then
and
i
am
confident
now
it
is
just
what
we
want
i
am
sure
that
the
monitor
is
still
afloat
and
that
she
will
yet
give
a
good
account
of
herself
sometimes
i
think
she
may
be
the
veritable
sling
with
a
stone
that
will
yet
smite
the
merrimac
philistine
in
the
forehead
soon
was
the
presidents
judgment
verified
for
the
fight
of
the
monitor
and
merrimac
changed
all
the
conditions
of
naval
warfare
after
the
victory
was
gained
the
presiding
captain
fox
and
others
went
on
board
the
monitor
and
captain
worden
was
requested
by
the
president
to
narrate
the
history
of
the
encounter
captain
worden
did
so
in
a
modest
manner
and
apologized
for
not
being
able
better
to
provide
for
his
guests
the
president
smilingly
responded
some
charitable
people
say
that
old
bourbon
is
an
indispensable
element
in
the
fighting
qualities
of
some
of
our
generals
in
the
field
but
captain
after
the
account
that
we
have
heard
today
no
one
will
say
that
any
dutch
courage
is
needed
on
board
the
monitor
it
never
has
been
sir
modestly
observed
the
captain
captain
fox
then
gave
a
description
of
what
he
saw
of
the
engagement
and
described
it
as
indescribably
grand
then
turning
to
the
president
he
continued
now
standing
here
on
the
deck
of
this
battlescarred
vessel
the

and

justice

in
armored
vessels
until
i
saw
this
battle
i
know
all
the
facts
which
united
to
give
us
the
monitor
i
withhold
no
credit
from
captain
ericsson
her
inventor
but
i
know
that
the
country
is
principally
indebted
for
the
construction
of
the
vessel
to
president
lincoln
and
for
the
success
of
her
trial
to
captain
worden
her
commander
her
only
imperfection
at
one
time
a
certain
major
hill
charged
lincoln
with
making
defamatory
remarks
regarding
mrs
hill
hill
was
insulting
in
his
language
to
lincoln
who
never
lost
his
temper
when
he
saw
his
chance
to
edge
a
word
in
lincoln
denied
emphatically
using
the
language
or
anything
like
that
attributed
to
him
he
entertained
he
insisted
a
high
regard
for
mrs
hill
and
the
only
thing
he
knew
to
her
discredit
was
the
fact
that
she
was
major
hills
wife
the
old
ladys
prophecy
among
those
who
called
to
congratulate
mr
lincoln
upon
his
nomination
for
president
was
an
old
lady
very
plainly
dressed
she
knew
mr
lincoln
but
mr
lincoln
did
not
at
first
recognize
her
then
she
undertook
to
recall
to
his
memory
certain
incidents
connected
with
his
ride
upon
the
circuitespecially
his
dining
at
her
house
upon
the
road
at
different
times
then
he
remembered
her
and
her
home
having
fixed
her
own
place
in
his
recollection
she
tried
to
recall
to
him
a
certain
scanty
dinner
of
bread
and
milk
that
he
once
ate
at
her
house
he
could
not
remember
iton
the
contrary
he
only
remembered
that
he
had
always
fared
well
at
her
house
well
she
said
one
day
you
came
along
after
we
had
got
through
dinner
and
we
had
eaten
up
everything
and
i
could
give
you
nothing
but
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
and
you
ate
it
and
when
you
got
up
you
said
it
was
good
enough
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
good
woman
had
come
in
from
the
country
making
a
journey
of
eight
or
ten
miles
to
relate
to
mr
lincoln
this
incident
which
in
her
mind
had
doubtless
taken
the
form
of
a
prophecy
mr
lincoln
placed
the
honest
creature
at
her
ease
chatted
with
her
of
old
times
and
dismissed
her
in
the
most
happy
frame
of
mind
how
the
town
of
lincoln
ill
was
named
the
story
of
naming
the
town
of
lincoln
the
county
seat
of
logan
county
illinois
is
thus
given
on
good
authority
the
first
railroad
had
been
built
through
the
county
and
a
station
was
about
to
be
located
there
lincoln
virgil
hitchcock
colonel
r
b
latham
and
several
others
were
sitting
on
a
pile
of
ties
and
talking
about
moving
a
county
seat
from
mount
pulaski
mr
lincoln
rose
and
started
to
walk
away
when
colonel
latham
said
lincoln
if
you
will
help
us
to
get
the
county
seat
here
we
will
call
the
place
lincoln
all
right
latham
he
replied
colonel
latham
then
deeded
him
a
lot
on
the
west
side
of
the
courthouse
and
he
owned
it
at
the
time
he
was
elected
president
old
jeffs
big
nightmare
jeff
davis
had
a
large
and
threatening
nightmare
in
november
and
what
he
saw
in
his
troubled
dreams
was
the
long
and
lanky
figure
of
abraham
lincoln
who
had
just
been
endorsed
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
for
another
term
in
the
white
house
at
washington
the
cartoon
reproduced
here
is
from
the
issue
of
frank
leslies
illustrated
newspaper
of
december
rd
it
being
entitled
jeff
davis
november
nightmare
davis
had
been
told
that
mcclellan
the
war
is
a
failure
candidate
for
the
presidency
would
have
no
difficulty
whatever
in
defeating
lincoln
that
negotiations
with
the
confederate
officials
for
the
cessation
of
hostilities
would
be
entered
into
as
soon
as
mcclellan
was
seated
in
the
chief
executives
chair
that
the
confederacy
would
in
all
probability
be
recognized
as
an
independent
government
by
the
washington
administration
that
the
sacred
institution
of
slavery
would
continue
to
do
business
at
the
old
stand
that
the
confederacy
would
be
one
of
the
great
nations
of
the
world
and
have
all
the
state
rights
and
other
things
it
wanted
with
absolutely
no
interference
whatever
upon
the
part
of
the
north
therefore
lincolns
reelection
was
a
rough
rude
shock
to
davis
who
had
not
prepared
himself
for
such
an
event
six
months
from
the
date
of
that
nightmaredream
he
was
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
union
forces
and
the
confederacy
was
a
thing
of
the
past
lincolns
last
official
act
probably
the
last
official
act
of
president
lincolns
life
was
the
signing
of
the
commission
reappointing
alvin
saunders
governor
of
nebraska
i
saw
mr
lincoln
regarding
the
matter
said
governor
saunders
and
he
told
me
to
go
home
that
he
would
attend
to
it
all
right
i
left
washington
on
the
morning
of
the
th
and
while
en
route
the
news
of
the
assassination
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
reached
me
i
immediately
wired
back
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
my
commission
and
was
told
that
the
room
had
not
been
opened
when
it
was
opened
the
document
was
found
lying
on
the
desk
mr
lincoln
signed
it
just
before
leaving
for
the
theater
that
fatal
evening
and
left
it
lying
there
unfolded
a
note
was
found
below
the
document
as
follows
rather
a
lengthy
commission
bestowing
upon
mr
alvin
saunders
the
official
authority
of
governor
of
the
territory
of
nebraska
then
came
lincolns
signature
which
with
one
exception
that
of
a
penciled
message
on
the
back
of
a
card
sent
up
by
a
friend
as
mr
lincoln
was
dressing
for
the
theater
was
the
very
last
signature
of
the
martyred
president
the
lad
needed
the
sleep
a
personal
friend
of
president
lincoln
is
authority
for
this
i
called
on
him
one
day
in
the
early
part
of
the
war
he
had
just
written
a
pardon
for
a
young
man
who
had
been
sentenced
to
be
shot
for
sleeping
at
his
post
he
remarked
as
he
read
it
to
me
i
could
not
think
of
going
into
eternity
with
the
blood
of
the
poor
young
man
on
my
skirts
then
he
added
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
a
boy
raised
on
a
farm
probably
in
the
habit
of
going
to
bed
at
dark
should
when
required
to
watch
fall
asleep
and
i
cannot
consent
to
shoot
him
for
such
an
act
massa
linkum
like
de
lord
by
the
act
of
emancipation
president
lincoln
built
for
himself
forever
the
first
place
in
the
affections
of
the
african
race
in
this
country
the
love
and
reverence
manifested
for
him
by
many
of
these
people
has
on
some
occasions
almost
reached
adoration
one
day
colonel
mckaye
of
new
york
who
had
been
one
of
a
committee
to
investigate
the
condition
of
the
freedmen
upon
his
return
from
hilton
head
and
beaufort
called
upon
the
president
and
in
the
course
of
the
interview
said
that
up
to
the
time
of
the
arrival
among
them
in
the
south
of
the
union
forces
they
had
no
knowledge
of
any
other
power
their
masters
fled
upon
the
approach
of
our
soldiers
and
this
gave
the
slaves
the
conception
of
a
power
greater
than
their
masters
exercised
this
power
they
called
massa
linkum
colonel
mckaye
said
their
place
of
worship
was
a
large
building
they
called
the
praise
house
and
the
leader
of
the
meeting
a
venerable
black
man
was
known
as
the
praise
man
on
a
certain
day
when
there
was
quite
a
large
gathering
of
the
people
considerable
confusion
was
created
by
different
persons
attempting
to
tell
who
and
what
massa
linkum
was
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
the
whiteheaded
leader
commanded
silence
brederen
said
he
you
dont
know

what
youse
talkin
bout
now
you
just
listen
to
me
massa
linkum
he
ebery
whar

then
solemnly
looking
up
he
added
he
walk
de
earf
like
de
lord
how
lincoln
took
the
news
one
of
lincolns
most
dearly
loved
friends
united
states
senator
edward
d
baker
of
oregon
colonel
of
the
seventyfirst
pennsylvania
a
former
townsman
of
mr
lincoln
was
killed
at
the
battle
of
balls
bluff
in
october
the
president
went
to
general
mcclellans
headquarters
to
hear
the
news
and
a
friend
thus
described
the
effect
it
had
upon
him
we
could
hear
the
click
of
the
telegraph
in
the
adjoining
room
and
low
conversation
between
the
president
and
general
mcclellan
succeeded
by
silence
excepting
the
click
click
of
the
instrument
which
went
on
with
its
tale
of
disaster
five
minutes
passed
and
then
mr
lincoln
unattended
with
bowed
head
and
tears
rolling
down
his
furrowed
cheeks
his
face
pale
and
wan
his
breast
heaving
with
emotion
passed
through
the
room
he
almost
fell
as
he
stepped
into
the
street
we
sprang
involuntarily
from
our
seats
to
render
assistance
but
he
did
not
fall
with
both
hands
pressed
upon
his
heart
he
walked
down
the
street
not
returning
the
salute
of
the
sentinel
pacing
his
beat
before
the
door
profanity
as
a
safetyvalve
lincoln
never
indulged
in
profanity
but
confessed
that
when
lee
was
beaten
at
malvern
hill
after
seven
days
of
fighting
and
richmond
but
twelve
miles
away
was
at
mcclellans
mercy
he
felt
very
much
like
swearing
when
he
learned
that
the
union
general
had
retired
to
harrisons
landing
lee
was
so
confident
his
opponent
would
not
go
to
richmond
that
he
took
his
army
into
marylanda
move
he
would
not
have
made
had
an
energetic
fighting
man
been
in
mcclellans
place
it
is
true
mcclellan
followed
and
defeated
lee
in
the
bloodiest
battle
of
the
warantietamafterwards
following
him
into
virginia
but
lincoln
could
not
bring
himself
to
forgive
the
generals
inaction
before
richmond
why
we
won
at
gettysburg
president
lincoln
said
to
general
sickles
just
after
the
victory
of
gettysburg
the
fact
is
general
in
the
stress
and
pinch
of
the
campaign
there
i
went
to
my
room
and
got
down
on
my
knees
and
prayed
god
almighty
for
victory
at
gettysburg
i
told
him
that
this
was
his
country
and
the
war
was
his
war
but
that
we
really
couldnt
stand
another
fredericksburg
or
chancellorsville
and
then
and
there
i
made
a
solemn
vow
with
my
maker
that
if
he
would
stand
by
you
boys
at
gettysburg
i
would
stand
by
him
and
he
did
and
i
will
and
after
this
i
felt
that
god
almighty
had
taken
the
whole
thing
into
his
hands
had
to
wait
for
him
president
lincoln
having
arranged
to
go
to
new
york
was
late
for
his
train
much
to
the
disgust
of
those
who
were
to
accompany
him
and
all
were
compelled
to
wait
several
hours
until
the
next
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
president
lincoln
was
much
amused
at
the
dissatisfaction
displayed
and
then
ventured
the
remark
that
the
situation
reminded
him
of
a
little
story
said
he
out
in
illinois
a
convict
who
had
murdered
his
cellmate
was
sentenced
to
be
hanged
on
the
day
set
for
the
execution
crowds
lined
the
roads
leading
to
the
spot
where
the
scaffold
had
been
erected
and
there
was
much
jostling
and
excitement
the
condemned
man
took
matters
coolly
and
as
one
batch
of
perspiring
anxious
men
rushed
past
the
cart
in
which
he
was
riding
he
called
out
dont
be
in
a
hurry
boys
youve
got
plenty
of
time
there
wont
be
any
fun
until
i
get
there
thats
the
condition
of
things
now
concluded
the
president
there
wont
be
any
fun
at
new
york
until
i
get
there
president
and
cabinet
joined
in
prayer
on
the
day
the
news
of
general
lees
surrender
at
appomattox
courthouse
was
received
so
an
intimate
friend
of
president
lincoln
relates
the
cabinet
meeting
was
held
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
neither
the
president
nor
any
member
of
the
cabinet
was
able
for
a
time
to
give
utterance
to
his
feelings
at
the
suggestion
of
mr
lincoln
all
dropped
on
their
knees
and
offered
in
silence
and
in
tears
their
humble
and
heartfelt
acknowledgments
to
the
almighty
for
the
triumph
he
had
granted
to
the
national
cause
believed
he
was
a
christian
mr
lincoln
was
much
impressed
with
the
devotion
and
earnestness
of
purpose
manifested
by
a
certain
lady
of
the
christian
commission
during
the
war
and
on
one
occasion
after
she
had
discharged
the
object
of
her
visit
said
to
her
madam
i
have
formed
a
high
opinion
of
your
christian
character
and
now
as
we
are
alone
i
have
a
mind
to
ask
you
to
give
me
in
brief
your
idea
of
what
constitutes
a
true
religious
experience
the
lady
replied
at
some
length
stating
that
in
her
judgment
it
consisted
of
a
conviction
of
ones
own
sinfulness
and
weakness
and
a
personal
need
of
the
saviour
for
strength
and
support
that
views
of
mere
doctrine
might
and
would
differ
but
when
one
was
really
brought
to
feel
his
need
of
divine
help
and
to
seek
the
aid
of
the
holy
spirit
for
strength
and
guidance
it
was
satisfactory
evidence
of
his
having
been
born
again
this
was
the
substance
of
her
reply
when
she
had
concluded
mr
lincoln
was
very
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
he
at
length
said
very
earnestly
if
what
you
have
told
me
is
really
a
correct
view
of
this
great
subject
i
think
i
can
say
with
sincerity
that
i
hope
i
am
a
christian
i
had
lived
he
continued
until
my
boy
willie
died
without
fully
realizing
these
things
that
blow
overwhelmed
me
it
showed
me
my
weakness
as
i
had
never
felt
it
before
and
if
i
can
take
what
you
have
stated
as
a
test
i
think
i
can
safely
say
that
i
know
something
of
that
change
of
which
you
speak
and
i
will
further
add
that
it
has
been
my
intention
for
some
time
at
a
suitable
opportunity
to
make
a
public
religious
profession
with
the
help
of
god
mr
lincoln
once
remarked
to
mr
noah
brooks
one
of
his
most
intimate
personal
friends
i
should
be
the
most
presumptuous
blockhead
upon
this
footstool
if
i
for
one
day
thought
that
i
could
discharge
the
duties
which
have
come
upon
me
since
i
came
to
this
place
without
the
aid
and
enlightenment
of
one
who
is
stronger
and
wiser
than
all
others
he
said
on
another
occasion
i
am
very
sure
that
if
i
do
not
go
away
from
here
a
wiser
man
i
shall
go
away
a
better
man
from
having
learned
here
what
a
very
poor
sort
of
a
man
i
am
turned
tears
to
smiles
one
night
schuyler
colfax
left
all
other
business
to
go
to
the
white
house
to
ask
the
president
to
respite
the
son
of
a
constituent
who
was
sentenced
to
be
shot
at
davenport
for
desertion
mr
lincoln
heard
the
story
with
his
usual
patience
though
he
was
wearied
out
with
incessant
calls
and
anxious
for
rest
and
then
replied
some
of
our
generals
complain
that
i
impair
discipline
and
subordination
in
the
army
by
my
pardons
and
respites
but
it
makes
me
rested
after
a
hard
days
work
if
i
can
find
some
good
excuse
for
saving
a
mans
life
and
i
go
to
bed
happy
as
i
think
how
joyous
the
signing
of
my
name
will
make
him
and
his
family
and
his
friends
and
with
a
happy
smile
beaming
over
that
carefurrowed
face
he
signed
that
name
that
saved
that
life
lincolns
last
written
words
as
the
president
and
mrs
lincoln
were
leaving
the
white
house
a
few
minutes
before
eight
oclock
on
the
evening
of
april
th
lincoln
wrote
this
note
allow
mr
ashmun
and
friend
to
come
to
see
me
at
oclock
a
m
tomorrow
april
th
women
plead
for
pardons
one
day
during
the
war
an
attractively
and
handsomely
dressed
woman
called
on
president
lincoln
to
procure
the
release
from
prison
of
a
relation
in
whom
she
professed
the
deepest
interest
she
was
a
good
talker
and
her
winning
ways
seemed
to
make
a
deep
impression
on
the
president
after
listening
to
her
story
he
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
card
this
woman
dear
stanton
is
a
little
smarter
than
she
looks
to
be
enclosed
it
in
an
envelope
and
directed
her
to
take
it
to
the
secretary
of
war
on
the
same
day
another
woman
called
more
humble
in
appearance
more
plainly
clad
it
was
the
old
story
father
and
son
both
in
the
army
the
former
in
prison
could
not
the
latter
be
discharged
from
the
army
and
sent
home
to
help
his
mother
a
few
strokes
of
the
pen
a
gentle
nod
of
the
head
and
the
little
woman
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
and
expressing
a
grateful
acknowledgment
her
tongue
could
not
utter
passed
out
a
lady
so
thankful
for
the
release
of
her
husband
was
in
the
act
of
kneeling
in
thankfulness
get
up
he
said
dont
kneel
to
me
but
thank
god
and
go
an
old
lady
for
the
same
reason
came
forward
with
tears
in
her
eyes
to
express
her
gratitude
goodbye
mr
lincoln
said
she
i
shall
probably
never
see
you
again
till
we
meet
in
heaven
she
had
the
presidents
hand
in
hers
and
he
was
deeply
moved
he
instantly
took
her
right
hand
in
both
of
his
and
following
her
to
the
door
said
i
am
afraid
with
all
my
troubles
i
shall
never
get
to
the
restingplace
you
speak
of
but
if
i
do
i
am
sure
i
shall
find
you
that
you
wish
me
to
get
there
is
i
believe
the
best
wish
you
could
make
for
me
goodbye
then
the
president
remarked
to
a
friend
it
is
more
than
many
can
often
say
that
in
doing
right
one
has
made
two
people
happy
in
one
day
speed
die
when
i
may
i
want
it
said
of
me
by
those
who
know
me
best
that
i
have
always
plucked
a
thistle
and
planted
a
flower
when
i
thought
a
flower
would
grow
lincoln
wished
to
see
richmond
the
president
remarked
to
admiral
david
d
porter
while
on
board
the
flagship
malvern
on
the
james
river
in
front
of
richmond
the
day
the
city
surrendered
thank
god
that
i
have
lived
to
see
this
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
been
dreaming
a
horrid
dream
for
four
years
and
now
the
nightmare
is
gone
i
wish
to
see
richmond
spoken
like
a
christian
frederick
douglass
told
in
these
words
of
his
first
interview
with
president
lincoln
i
approached
him
with
trepidation
as
to
how
this
great
man
might
receive
me
but
one
word
and
look
from
him
banished
all
my
fears
and
set
me
perfectly
at
ease
i
have
often
said
since
that
meeting
that
it
was
much
easier
to
see
and
converse
with
a
great
man
than
it
was
with
a
small
man
on
that
occasion
he
said
douglass
you
need
not
tell
me
who
you
are
mr
seward
has
told
me
all
about
you
i
then
saw
that
there
was
no
reason
to
tell
him
my
personal
story
however
interesting
it
might
be
to
myself
or
others
so
i
told
him
at
once
the
object
of
my
visit
it
was
to
get
some
expression
from
him
upon
three
points
equal
pay
to
colored
soldiers
their
promotion
when
they
had
earned
it
on
the
battlefield
should
they
be
taken
prisoners
and
enslaved
or
hanged
as
jefferson
davis
had
threatened
an
equal
number
of
confederate
prisoners
should
be
executed
within
our
lines
a
declaration
to
that
effect
i
thought
would
prevent
the
execution
of
the
rebel
threat
to
all
but
the
last
president
lincoln
assented
he
argued
however
that
neither
equal
pay
nor
promotion
could
be
granted
at
once
he
said
that
in
view
of
existing
prejudices
it
was
a
great
step
forward
to
employ
colored
troops
at
all
that
it
was
necessary
to
avoid
everything
that
would
offend
this
prejudice
and
increase
opposition
to
the
measure
he
detailed
the
steps
by
which
white
soldiers
were
reconciled
to
the
employment
of
colored
troops
how
these
were
first
employed
as
laborers
how
it
was
thought
they
should
not
be
armed
or
uniformed
like
white
soldiers
how
they
should
only
be
made
to
wear
a
peculiar
uniform
how
they
should
be
employed
to
hold
forts
and
arsenals
in
sickly
locations
and
not
enter
the
field
like
other
soldiers
with
all
these
restrictions
and
limitations
he
easily
made
me
see
that
much
would
be
gained
when
the
colored
man
loomed
before
the
country
as
a
fullfledged
united
states
soldier
to
fight
flourish
or
fall
in
defense
of
the
united
republic
the
great
soul
of
lincoln
halted
only
when
he
came
to
the
point
of
retaliation
the
thought
of
hanging
men
in
cold
blood
even
though
the
rebels
should
murder
a
few
of
the
colored
prisoners
was
a
horror
from
which
he
shrank
oh
douglass
i
cannot
do
that
if
i
could
get
hold
of
the
actual
murderers
of
colored
prisoners
i
would
retaliate
but
to
hang
those
who
have
no
hand
in
such
murders
i
cannot
the
contemplation
of
such
an
act
brought
to
his
countenance
such
an
expression
of
sadness
and
pity
that
it
made
it
hard
for
me
to
press
my
point
though
i
told
him
it
would
tend
to
save
rather
than
destroy
life
he
however
insisted
that
this
work
of
blood
once
begun
would
be
hard
to
stopthat
such
violence
would
beget
violence
he
argued
more
like
a
disciple
of
christ
than
a
commanderinchief
of
the
army
and
navy
of
a
warlike
nation
already
involved
in
a
terrible
war
how
sad
and
strange
the
fate
of
this
great
and
good
man
the
saviour
of
his
country
the
embodiment
of
human
charity
whose
heart
though
strong
was
as
tender
as
a
heart
of
childhood
who
always
tempered
justice
with
mercy
who
sought
to
supplant
the
sword
with
counsel
of
reason
to
suppress
passion
by
kindness
and
moderation
who
had
a
sigh
for
every
human
grief
and
a
tear
for
every
human
woe
should
at
last
perish
by
the
hand
of
a
desperate
assassin
against
whom
no
thought
of
malice
had
ever
entered
his
heart
lincoln
goes
in
when
the
quakers
are
out
one
of
the
campaign
songs
of
which
will
never
be
forgotten
was
whittiers
the
quakers
are
out
give
the
flags
to
the
winds
set
the
hills
all
aflame
make
way
for
the
man
with
the
patriarchs
name
away
with
misgivingsaway
with
all
doubt
for
lincoln
goes
in
when
the
quakers
are
out
speaking
of
this
song
with
which
he
was
greatly
pleased
one
day
at
the
white
house
the
president
said
it
reminds
me
of
a
little
story
i
heard
years
ago
out
in
illinois
a
political
campaign
was
on
and
the
atmosphere
was
kept
at
a
high
temperature
several
fights
had
already
occurred
many
men
having
been
seriously
hurt
and
the
prospects
were
that
the
result
would
be
close
one
of
the
candidates
was
a
professional
politician
with
a
huge
wart
on
his
nose
this
disfigurement
having
earned
for
him
the
nickname
of
warty
his
opponent
was
a
young
lawyer
who
wore
biled
shirts
was
shaved
by
a
barber
and
had
his
clothes
made
to
fit
him
now
warty
was
of
quaker
stock
and
around
election
time
made
a
great
parade
of
the
fact
when
there
were
no
campaigns
in
progress
he
was
anything
but
quakerish
in
his
language
or
actions
the
young
lawyer
didnt
know
what
the
inside
of
a
meeting
house
looked
like
well
the
night
before
electionday
the
two
candidates
came
together
at
a
joint
debate
both
being
on
the
speakers
platform
the
young
lawyer
had
to
speak
after
warty
and
his
reputation
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
quaker
who
told
the
many
friends
present
what
a
wicked
fellow
the
young
man
wasnever
went
to
church
swore
drank
smoked
and
gambled
after
warty
had
finished
the
other
arose
and
faced
the
audience
im
not
a
good
man
said
he
and
what
my
opponent
has
said
about
me
is
true
enough
but
im
always
the
same
i
dont
profess
religion
when
i
run
for
office
and
then
turn
around
and
associate
with
bad
people
when
the
campaigns
over
im
no
hypocrite
i
dont
sing
many
psalms
neither
does
my
opponent
and
talking
about
singing
id
just
like
to
hear
my
friend
who
is
running
against
me
sing
the
songfor
the
benefit
of
this
audiencei
heard
him
sing
the
night
after
he
was
nominated
i
yield
the
floor
to
him
of
course
warty
refused
his
quaker
supporters
grew
suspicious
and
when
they
turned
out
at
the
polls
the
following
day
they
voted
for
the
wicked
young
lawyer
so
its
true
that
when
the
quakers
are
out
the
man
they
support
is
apt
to
go
in
had
confidence
in
himbut
general
blank
asks
for
more
men
said
secretary
of
war
stanton
to
the
president
one
day
showing
the
latter
a
telegram
from
the
commander
named
appealing
for
reenforcements
i
guess
hes
killed
off
enough
men
hasnt
he
queried
the
president
i
dont
mean
confederatesour
own
men
whats
the
use
in
sending
volunteers
down
to
him
if
theyre
only
used
to
fill
graves
his
dispatch
seems
to
imply
that
in
his
opinion
you
have
not
the
confidence
in
him
he
thinks
he
deserves
the
war
secretary
went
on
to
say
as
he
looked
over
the
telegram
again
oh
was
the
presidents
reply
he
neednt
lose
any
of
his
sleep
on
that
account
just
telegraph
him
to
that
effect
also
that
i
dont
propose
to
send
him
any
more
men
how
hominy
was
originated
during
the
progress
of
a
cabinet
meeting
the
subject
of
food
for
the
men
in
the
army
happened
to
come
up
from
that
the
conversation
changed
to
the
study
of
the
latin
language
i
studied
latin
once
said
mr
lincoln
in
a
casual
way
were
you
interested
in
it
asked
mr
seward
the
secretary
of
state
well
yes
i
saw
some
very
curious
things
was
the
presidents
rejoinder
what
asked
secretary
seward
well
theres
the
word
hominy
for
instance
we
have
just
ordered
a
lot
of
that
stuff
for
the
troops
i
see
how
the
word
originated
i
notice
it
came
from
the
latin
word
homoa
man
when
we
decline
homo
it
is
homoa
man
hominisof
man
hominifor
man
so
you
see
hominy
being
for
man
comes
from
the
latin
i
guess
those
soldiers
who
dont
know
latin
will
get
along
with
it
all
rightthough
i
wont
rest
real
easy
until
i
hear
from
the
commissary
department
on
it
his
ideas
old
after
all
one
day
while
listening
to
one
of
the
wise
men
who
had
called
at
the
white
house
to
unload
a
large
cargo
of
advice
the
president
interjected
a
remark
to
the
effect
that
he
had
a
great
reverence
for
learning
this
is
not
president
lincoln
explained
because
i
am
not
an
educated
man
i
feel
the
need
of
reading
it
is
a
loss
to
a
man
not
to
have
grown
up
among
books
men
of
force
the
visitor
answered
can
get
on
pretty
well
without
books
they
do
their
own
thinking
instead
of
adopting
what
other
men
think
yes
said
mr
lincoln
but
books
serve
to
show
a
man
that
those
original
thoughts
of
his
arent
very
new
after
all
this
was
a
point
the
caller
was
not
willing
to
debate
and
so
he
cut
his
call
short
lincolns
first
speech
lincoln
made
his
first
speech
when
he
was
a
mere
boy
going
barefoot
his
trousers
held
up
by
one
suspender
and
his
shock
of
hair
sticking
through
a
hole
in
the
crown
of
his
cheap
straw
hat
abe
in
company
with
dennis
hanks
attended
a
political
meeting
which
was
addressed
by
a
typical
stump
speakerone
of
those
loudvoiced
fellows
who
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
waved
his
arms
wildly
at
the
conclusion
of
the
speech
which
did
not
meet
the
views
either
of
abe
or
dennis
the
latter
declared
that
abe
could
make
a
better
speech
than
that
whereupon
he
got
a
drygoods
box
and
called
on
abe
to
reply
to
the
campaign
orator
lincoln
threw
his
old
straw
hat
on
the
ground
and
mounting
the
drygoods
box
delivered
a
speech
which
held
the
attention
of
the
crowd
and
won
him
considerable
applause
even
the
campaign
orator
admitted
that
it
was
a
fine
speech
and
answered
every
point
in
his
own
oration
dennis
hanks
who
thought
abe
was
about
the
greatest
man
that
ever
lived
was
delighted
and
he
often
told
how
young
abe
got
the
better
of
the
trained
campaign
speaker
abe
wanted
no
sneakin
round
it
was
in
when
abe
was
just
twentyone
years
of
age
that
the
lincoln
family
moved
from
gentryville
indiana
to
near
decatur
illinois
their
household
goods
being
packed
in
a
wagon
drawn
by
four
oxen
driven
by
abe
the
winter
previous
the
latter
had
worked
in
a
country
store
in
gentryville
and
before
undertaking
the
journey
he
invested
all
the
money
he
hadsome
thirty
dollarsin
notions
such
as
needles
pins
thread
buttons
and
other
domestic
necessities
these
he
sold
to
families
along
the
route
and
made
a
profit
of
about
one
hundred
per
cent
this
mercantile
adventure
of
his
youth
reminded
the
president
of
a
very
clever
story
while
the
members
of
the
cabinet
were
one
day
solemnly
debating
a
rather
serious
international
problem
the
president
was
in
the
minority
as
was
frequently
the
case
and
he
was
in
a
hole
as
he
afterwards
expressed
it
he
didnt
want
to
argue
the
points
raised
preferring
to
settle
the
matter
in
a
hurry
and
an
apt
story
was
his
only
salvation
suddenly
the
presidents
fact
brightened
gentlemen
said
he
addressing
those
seated
at
the
cabinet
table
the
situation
just
now
reminds
me
of
a
fix
i
got
into
some
thirty
years
or
so
ago
when
i
was
peddling
notions
on
the
way
from
indiana
to
illinois
i
didnt
have
a
large
stock
but
i
charged
large
prices
and
i
made
money
perhaps
you
dont
see
what
i
am
driving
at
secretary
of
state
seward
was
wearing
a
most
gloomy
expression
of
countenance
secretary
of
war
stanton
was
savage
and
inclined
to
be
morose
secretary
of
the
treasury
chase
was
indifferent
and
cynical
while
the
others
of
the
presidential
advisers
resigned
themselves
to
the
hearing
of
the
inevitable
story
i
dont
propose
to
argue
this
matter
the
president
went
on
to
say
because
arguments
have
no
effect
upon
men
whose
opinions
are
fixed
and
whose
minds
are
made
up
but
this
little
story
of
mine
will
make
some
things
which
now
are
in
the
dark
show
up
more
clearly
there
was
another
pause
and
the
cabinet
officers
maintaining
their
previous
silence
began
wondering
if
the
president
himself
really
knew
what
he
was
driving
at
just
before
we
left
indiana
and
crossed
into
illinois
continued
mr
lincoln
solemnly
speaking
in
a
grave
tone
of
voice
we
came
across
a
small
farmhouse
full
of
nothing
but
children
these
ranged
in
years
from
seventeen
years
to
seventeen
months
and
all
were
in
tears
the
mother
of
the
family
was
redheaded
and
redfaced
and
the
whip
she
held
in
her
right
hand
led
to
the
inference
that
she
had
been
chastising
her
brood
the
father
of
the
family
a
meeklooking
mildmannered
towheaded
chap
was
standing
in
the
front
doorway
awaitingto
all
appearanceshis
turn
to
feel
the
thong
i
thought
there
wasnt
much
use
in
asking
the
head
of
that
house
if
she
wanted
any
notions
she
was
too
busy
it
was
evident
an
insurrection
had
been
in
progress
but
it
was
pretty
well
quelled
when
i
got
there
the
mother
had
about
suppressed
it
with
an
iron
hand
but
she
was
not
running
any
risks
she
kept
a
keen
and
wary
eye
upon
all
the
children
not
forgetting
an
occasional
glance
at
the
old
man
in
the
doorway
she
saw
me
as
i
came
up
and
from
her
look
i
thought
she
was
of
the
opinion
that
i
intended
to
interfere
advancing
to
the
doorway
and
roughly
pushing
her
husband
aside
she
demanded
my
business
nothing
madame
i
answered
as
gently
as
possible
i
merely
dropped
in
as
i
came
along
to
see
how
things
were
going
well
you
neednt
wait
was
the
reply
in
an
irritated
way
theres
trouble
here
an
lots
of
it
too
but
i
kin
manage
my
own
affairs
without
the
help
of
outsiders
this
is
jest
a
family
row
but
ill
teach
these
brats
their
places
ef
i
hev
to
lick
the
hide
off
evry
one
of
them
i
dont
do
much
talkin
but
i
run
this
house
an
i
dont
want
no
one
sneakin
round
tryin
to
find
out
how
i
do
it
either
thats
the
case
here
with
us
the
president
said
in
conclusion
we
must
let
the
other
nations
know
that
we
propose
to
settle
our
family
row
in
our
own
way
and
teach
these
brats
their
places
the
seceding
states
if
we
have
to
lick
the
hide
off
of
each
and
every
one
of
them
and
like
the
old
woman
we
dont
want
any
sneakin
round
by
other
countries
who
would
like
to
find
out
how
we
are
to
do
it
either
now
seward
you
write
some
diplomatic
notes
to
that
effect
and
the
cabinet
session
closed
didnt
even
need
stilts
as
the
president
considered
it
his
duty
to
keep
in
touch
with
all
the
improvements
in
the
armament
of
the
vessels
belonging
to
the
united
states
navy
he
was
necessarily
interested
in
the
various
types
of
these
floating
fortresses
not
only
was
it
required
of
the
navy
department
to
furnish
seagoing
warships
deepdraught
vessels
for
the
great
rivers
and
the
lakes
but
this
department
also
found
use
for
little
gunboats
which
could
creep
along
in
the
shallowest
of
water
and
attack
the
confederates
in
byplaces
and
swamps
the
consequence
of
the
interest
taken
by
mr
lincoln
in
the
navy
was
that
he
was
besieged
day
and
night
by
steamboat
contractors
each
one
eager
to
sell
his
product
to
the
washington
government
all
sorts
of
experiments
were
tried
some
being
dire
failures
while
others
were
more
than
fairly
successful
more
than
once
had
these
tiny
war
vessels
proved
themselves
of
great
service
and
the
united
states
government
had
a
large
number
of
them
built
there
was
one
particular
contractor
who
bothered
the
president
more
than
all
the
others
put
together
he
was
constantly
impressing
upon
mr
lincoln
the
great
superiority
of
his
boats
because
they
would
run
in
such
shallow
water
oh
yes
replied
the
president
ive
no
doubt
theyll
run
anywhere
where
the
ground
is
a
little
moist
how
do
you
get
out
of
this
place
it
seems
to
me
remarked
the
president
one
day
while
reading
over
some
of
the
appealing
telegrams
sent
to
the
war
department
by
general
mcclellan
that
mcclellan
has
been
wandering
around
and
has
sort
of
got
lost
hes
been
hollering
for
help
ever
since
he
went
southwants
somebody
to
come
to
his
deliverance
and
get
him
out
of
the
place
hes
got
into
he
reminds
me
of
the
story
of
a
man
out
in
illinois
who
in
company
with
a
number
of
friends
visited
the
state
penitentiary
they
wandered
all
through
the
institution
and
saw
everything
but
just
about
the
time
to
depart
this
particular
man
became
separated
from
his
friends
and
couldnt
find
his
way
out
he
roamed
up
and
down
one
corridor
after
another
becoming
more
desperate
all
the
time
when
at
last
he
came
across
a
convict
who
was
looking
out
from
between
the
bars
of
his
celldoor
here
was
salvation
at
last
hurrying
up
to
the
prisoner
he
hastily
asked
say
how
do
you
get
out
of
this
place
tad
introduces
our
friends
president
lincoln
often
avoided
interviews
with
delegations
representing
various
states
especially
when
he
knew
the
objects
of
their
errands
and
was
aware
he
could
not
grant
their
requests
this
was
the
case
with
several
commissioners
from
kentucky
who
were
put
off
from
day
to
day
they
were
about
to
give
up
in
despair
and
were
leaving
the
white
house
lobby
their
speech
being
interspersed
with
vehement
and
uncomplimentary
terms
concerning
old
abe
when
tad
happened
along
he
caught
at
these
words
and
asked
one
of
them
if
they
wanted
to
see
old
abe
laughing
at
the
same
time
yes
he
replied
wait
a
minute
said
tad
and
rushed
into
his
fathers
office
said
he
papa
may
i
introduce
some
friends
to
you
his
father
always
indulgent
and
ready
to
make
him
happy
kindly
said
yes
my
son
i
will
see
your
friends
tad
went
to
the
kentuckians
again
and
asked
a
very
dignified
looking
gentleman
of
the
party
his
name
he
was
told
his
name
he
then
said
come
gentlemen
and
they
followed
him
leading
them
up
to
the
president
tad
with
much
dignity
said
papa
let
me
introduce
to
you
judge
of
kentucky
and
quickly
added
now
judge
you
introduce
the
other
gentlemen
the
introductions
were
gone
through
with
and
they
turned
out
to
be
the
gentlemen
mr
lincoln
had
been
avoiding
for
a
week
mr
lincoln
reached
for
the
boy
took
him
in
his
lap
kissed
him
and
told
him
it
was
all
right
and
that
he
had
introduced
his
friend
like
a
little
gentleman
as
he
was
tad
was
eleven
years
old
at
this
time
the
president
was
pleased
with
tads
diplomacy
and
often
laughed
at
the
incident
as
he
told
others
of
it
one
day
while
caressing
the
boy
he
asked
him
why
he
called
those
gentlemen
his
friends
well
said
tad
i
had
seen
them
so
often
and
they
looked
so
good
and
sorry
and
said
they
were
from
kentucky
that
i
thought
they
must
be
our
friends
that
is
right
my
son
said
mr
lincoln
i
would
have
the
whole
human
race
your
friends
and
mine
if
it
were
possible
mixed
up
worse
than
before
the
president
told
a
story
which
most
beautifully
illustrated
the
muddled
situation
of
affairs
at
the
time
mcclellans
fate
was
hanging
in
the
balance
mcclellans
s
work
was
not
satisfactory
but
the
president
hesitated
to
remove
him
the
general
was
so
slow
that
the
confederates
marched
all
around
him
and
to
add
to
the
dilemma
the
president
could
not
find
a
suitable
man
to
take
mcclellans
place
the
latter
was
a
political
as
well
as
a
military
factor
his
friends
threatened
that
if
he
was
removed
many
war
democrats
would
cast
their
influence
with
the
south
etc
it
was
altogether
a
sad
mixup
and
the
president
for
a
time
was
at
his
wits
end
he
was
assailed
on
all
sides
with
advice
but
none
of
it
was
worth
acting
upon
this
situation
reminds
me
said
the
president
at
a
cabinet
meeting
one
day
not
long
before
the
appointment
of
general
halleck
as
mcclellans
successor
in
command
of
the
union
forces
of
a
union
man
in
kentucky
whose
two
sons
enlisted
in
the
federal
army
his
wife
was
of
confederate
sympathies
his
nearest
neighbor
was
a
confederate
in
feeling
and
his
two
sons
were
fighting
under
lee
this
neighbors
wife
was
a
union
woman
and
it
nearly
broke
her
heart
to
know
that
her
sons
were
arrayed
against
the
union
finally
the
two
men
after
each
had
talked
the
matter
over
with
his
wife
agreed
to
obtain
divorces
this
they
did
and
the
union
man
and
union
woman
were
wedded
as
were
the
confederate
man
and
the
confederate
womanthe
men
swapped
wives
in
short
but
this
didnt
seem
to
help
matters
any
for
the
sons
of
the
union
woman
were
still
fighting
for
the
south
and
the
sons
of
the
confederate
woman
continued
in
the
federal
army
the
union
husband
couldnt
get
along
with
his
union
wife
and
the
confederate
husband
and
his
confederate
wife
couldnt
agree
upon
anything
being
forever
fussing
and
quarreling
its
the
same
thing
with
the
army
it
doesnt
seem
worth
while
to
secure
divorces
and
then
marry
the
army
and
mcclellan
to
others
for
they
wont
get
along
any
better
than
they
do
now
and
therell
only
be
a
new
set
of
heartaches
started
i
think
wed
better
wait
perhaps
a
real
fighting
general
will
come
along
some
of
these
days
and
then
well
all
be
happy
if
you
go
to
mixing
in
a
mixup
you
only
make
the
muddle
worse
long
abes
feet
protruded
over
george
m
pullman
the
great
sleepingcar
builder
once
told
a
joke
in
which
lincoln
was
the
prominent
figure
in
fact
there
wouldnt
have
been
any
joke
had
it
not
been
for
long
abe
at
the
time
of
the
occurrence
which
was
the
foundation
for
the
jokeand
pullman
admitted
that
the
latter
was
on
himpullman
was
the
conductor
of
his
only
sleepingcar
the
latter
was
an
experiment
and
pullman
was
doing
everything
possible
to
get
the
railroads
to
take
hold
of
it
one
night
said
pullman
in
telling
the
story
as
we
were
about
going
out
of
chicagothis
was
long
before
lincoln
was
what
you
might
call
a
renowned
mana
long
lean
ugly
man
with
a
wart
on
his
cheek
came
into
the
depot
he
paid
me
fifty
cents
and
half
a
berth
was
assigned
him
then
he
took
off
his
coat
and
vest
and
hung
them
up
and
they
fitted
the
peg
about
as
well
as
they
fitted
him
then
he
kicked
off
his
boots
which
were
of
surprising
length
turned
into
the
berth
and
undoubtedly
having
an
easy
conscience
was
sleeping
like
a
healthy
baby
before
the
car
left
the
depot
pretty
soon
along
came
another
passenger
and
paid
his
fifty
cents
in
two
minutes
he
was
back
at
me
angry
as
a
wet
hen
theres
a
man
in
that
berth
of
mine
said
he
hotly
and
hes
about
ten
feet
high
how
am
i
going
to
sleep
there
id
like
to
know
go
and
look
at
him
in
i
wentmad
too
the
tall
lank
mans
knees
were
under
his
chin
his
arms
were
stretched
across
the
bed
and
his
feet
were
stored
comfortablyfor
him
i
shook
him
until
he
awoke
and
then
told
him
if
he
wanted
the
whole
berth
he
would
have
to
pay
my
dear
sir
said
the
tall
man
a
contract
is
a
contract
i
have
paid
you
fifty
cents
for
half
this
berth
and
as
you
see
im
occupying
it
theres
the
other
half
pointing
to
a
strip
about
six
inches
wide
sell
that
and
dont
disturb
me
again
and
so
saying
the
man
with
a
wart
on
his
face
went
to
sleep
again
he
was
abraham
lincoln
and
he
never
grew
any
shorter
afterward
we
became
great
friends
and
often
laughed
over
the
incident
could
lick
any
man
in
the
crowd
when
the
enemies
of
general
grant
were
bothering
the
president
with
emphatic
and
repeated
demands
that
the
silent
man
be
removed
from
command
mr
lincoln
remained
firm
he
would
not
consent
to
lose
the
services
of
so
valuable
a
soldier
grant
fights
said
he
in
response
to
the
charges
made
that
grant
was
a
butcher
a
drunkard
an
incompetent
and
a
general
who
did
not
know
his
business
that
reminds
me
of
a
story
president
lincoln
said
one
day
to
a
delegation
of
the
grantisnogood
style
out
in
my
state
of
illinois
there
was
a
man
nominated
for
sheriff
of
the
county
he
was
a
good
man
for
the
office
brave
determined
and
honest
but
not
much
of
an
orator
in
fact
he
couldnt
talk
at
all
he
couldnt
make
a
speech
to
save
his
life
his
friends
knew
he
was
a
man
who
would
preserve
the
peace
of
the
county
and
perform
the
duties
devolving
upon
him
all
right
but
the
people
of
the
county
didnt
know
it
they
wanted
him
to
come
out
boldly
on
the
platform
at
political
meetings
and
state
his
convictions
and
principles
they
had
been
used
to
speeches
from
candidates
and
were
somewhat
suspicious
of
a
man
who
was
afraid
to
open
his
mouth
at
last
the
candidate
consented
to
make
a
speech
and
his
friends
were
delighted
the
candidate
was
on
hand
and
when
he
was
called
upon
advanced
to
the
front
and
faced
the
crowd
there
was
a
glitter
in
his
eye
that
wasnt
pleasing
and
the
way
he
walked
out
to
the
front
of
the
stand
showed
that
he
knew
just
what
he
wanted
to
say
feller
citizens
was
his
beginning
the
words
spoken
quietly
im
not
a
speakin
man
i
aint
no
orator
an
i
never
stood
up
before
a
lot
of
people
in
my
life
before
im
not
goin
to
make
no
speech
xcept
to
say
that
i
can
lick
any
man
in
the
crowd
his
way
to
a
childs
heart
charles
e
anthonys
one
meeting
with
mr
lincoln
presents
an
interesting
contrast
to
those
of
the
men
who
shared
the
emancipators
interest
in
public
affairs
it
was
in
the
latter
part
of
the
winter
of
a
short
time
before
mr
lincoln
left
for
his
inauguration
at
washington
judge
anthony
went
to
the
sherman
house
where
the
presidentelect
was
stopping
and
took
with
him
his
son
charles
then
but
a
little
boy
charles
played
about
the
room
as
a
child
will
looking
at
whatever
interested
him
for
the
time
and
when
the
interview
with
his
father
was
over
he
was
ready
to
go
but
mr
lincoln
ever
interested
in
little
children
called
the
lad
to
him
and
took
him
upon
his
great
knee
my
impression
of
him
all
the
time
i
had
been
playing
about
the
room
said
mr
anthony
was
that
he
was
a
terribly
homely
man
i
was
rather
repelled
but
no
sooner
did
he
speak
to
me
than
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
completely
or
rather
my
view
of
it
changed
it
at
once
became
kindly
and
attractive
he
asked
me
some
questions
seeming
instantly
to
find
in
the
turmoil
of
all
the
great
questions
that
must
have
been
heavy
upon
him
the
very
ones
that
would
go
to
the
thought
of
a
child
i
answered
him
without
hesitation
and
after
a
moment
he
patted
my
shoulder
and
said
well
youll
be
a
man
before
your
mother
yet
and
put
me
down
i
had
never
before
heard
the
homely
old
expression
and
it
puzzled
me
for
a
time
after
a
moment
i
understood
it
but
he
looked
at
me
while
i
was
puzzling
over
it
and
seemed
to
be
amused
as
no
doubt
he
was
the
incident
simply
illustrates
the
ease
and
readiness
with
which
lincoln
could
turn
from
the
mighty
questions
before
the
nation
give
a
moments
interested
attention
to
a
child
and
return
at
once
to
matters
of
state
left
it
the
women
to
howl
about
me
donn
piatt
one
of
the
brightest
newspaper
writers
in
the
country
told
a
good
story
on
the
president
in
regard
to
the
refusal
of
the
latter
to
sanction
the
death
penalty
in
cases
of
desertion
from
the
union
army
there
was
far
more
policy
in
this
course
said
piatt
than
kind
feeling
to
assert
the
contrary
is
to
detract
from
lincolns
force
of
character
as
well
as
intellect
our
war
president
was
not
lost
in
his
high
admiration
of
brigadiers
and
majorgenerals
and
had
a
positive
dislike
for
their
methods
and
the
despotism
upon
which
an
army
is
based
he
knew
that
he
was
dependent
upon
volunteers
for
soldiers
and
to
force
upon
such
men
as
those
the
stern
discipline
of
the
regular
army
was
to
render
the
service
unpopular
and
it
pleased
him
to
be
the
source
of
mercy
as
well
as
the
fountain
of
honor
in
this
direction
i
was
sitting
with
general
dan
tyler
of
connecticut
in
the
antechamber
of
the
war
department
shortly
after
the
adjournment
of
the
buell
court
of
inquiry
of
which
we
had
been
members
when
president
lincoln
came
in
from
the
room
of
secretary
stanton
seeing
us
he
said
well
gentlemen
have
you
any
matter
worth
reporting
i
think
so
mr
president
replied
general
tyler
we
had
it
proven
that
bragg
with
less
than
ten
thousand
men
drove
your
eightythree
thousand
men
under
buell
back
from
before
chattanooga
down
to
the
ohio
at
louisville
marched
around
us
twice
then
doubled
us
up
at
perryville
and
finally
got
out
of
the
state
of
kentucky
with
all
his
plunder
now
tyler
returned
the
president
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
what
is
the
lesson
dont
our
men
march
as
well
and
fight
as
well
as
these
rebels
if
not
there
is
a
fault
somewhere
we
are
all
of
the
same
familysame
sort
yes
there
is
a
lesson
replied
general
tyler
we
are
of
the
same
sort
but
subject
to
different
handling
braggs
little
force
was
superior
to
our
larger
number
because
he
had
it
under
control
if
a
man
left
his
ranks
he
was
punished
if
he
deserted
he
was
shot
we
had
nothing
of
that
sort
if
we
attempt
to
shoot
a
deserter
you
pardon
him
and
our
army
is
without
discipline
the
president
looked
perplexed
why
do
you
interfere
continued
general
tyler
congress
has
taken
from
you
all
responsibility
yes
answered
the
president
impatiently
congress
has
taken
the
responsibility
and
left
the
women
to
howl
all
about
me
and
so
he
strode
away
hed
ruin
all
the
other
convicts
one
of
the
droll
stories
brought
into
play
by
the
president
as
an
ally
in
support
of
his
contention
proved
most
effective
politics
was
rife
among
the
generals
of
the
union
army
and
there
was
more
wirepulling
to
prevent
the
advancement
of
fellow
commanders
than
the
laying
of
plans
to
defeat
the
confederates
in
battle
however
when
it
so
happened
that
the
name
of
a
particularly
unpopular
general
was
sent
to
the
senate
for
confirmation
the
protest
against
his
promotion
was
almost
unanimous
the
nomination
didnt
seem
to
please
anyone
generals
who
were
enemies
before
conferred
together
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
every
possible
influence
to
bear
upon
the
senate
and
securing
the
rejection
of
the
hated
leaders
name
the
president
was
surprised
he
had
never
known
such
unanimity
before
you
remind
me
said
the
president
to
a
delegation
of
officers
which
called
upon
him
one
day
to
present
a
fresh
protest
to
him
regarding
the
nomination
of
a
visit
a
certain
governor
paid
to
the
penitentiary
of
his
state
it
had
been
announced
that
the
governor
would
hear
the
story
of
every
inmate
of
the
institution
and
was
prepared
to
rectify
either
by
commutation
or
pardon
any
wrongs
that
had
been
done
to
any
prisoner
one
by
one
the
convicts
appeared
before
his
excellency
and
each
one
maintained
that
he
was
an
innocent
man
who
had
been
sent
to
prison
because
the
police
didnt
like
him
or
his
friends
and
relatives
wanted
his
property
or
he
was
too
popular
etc
etc
the
last
prisoner
to
appear
was
an
individual
who
was
not
all
prepossessing
his
face
was
against
him
his
eyes
were
shifty
he
didnt
have
the
appearance
of
an
honest
man
and
he
didnt
act
like
one
well
asked
the
governor
impatiently
i
suppose
youre
innocent
like
the
rest
of
these
fellows
no
governor
was
the
unexpected
answer
i
was
guilty
of
the
crime
they
charged
against
me
and
i
got
just
what
i
deserved
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
astonishment
the
governor
looking
the
fellow
squarely
in
the
face
remarked
with
emphasis
ill
have
to
pardon
you
because
i
dont
want
to
leave
so
bad
a
man
as
you
are
in
the
company
of
such
innocent
sufferers
as
i
have
discovered
your
fellowconvicts
to
be
you
might
corrupt
them
and
teach
them
wicked
tricks
as
soon
as
i
get
back
to
the
capital
ill
have
the
papers
made
out
you
gentlemen
continued
the
president
ought
to
be
glad
that
so
bad
a
man
as
you
represent
this
officer
to
be
is
to
get
his
promotion
for
then
you
wont
be
forced
to
associate
with
him
and
suffer
the
contamination
of
his
presence
and
influence
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
have
the
senate
confirm
him
and
he
was
confirmed
in
a
hopeless
minority
the
president
was
often
in
opposition
to
the
general
public
sentiment
of
the
north
upon
certain
questions
of
policy
but
he
bided
his
time
and
things
usually
came
out
as
he
wanted
them
it
was
lincolns
opinion
from
the
first
that
apology
and
reparation
to
england
must
be
made
by
the
united
states
because
of
the
arrest
upon
the
high
seas
of
the
confederate
commissioners
mason
and
slidell
the
country
however
the
northern
states
was
wild
for
a
conflict
with
england
one
war
at
a
time
quietly
remarked
the
president
at
a
cabinet
meeting
where
he
found
the
majority
of
his
advisers
unfavorably
disposed
to
backing
down
but
one
member
of
the
cabinet
was
a
really
strong
supporter
of
the
president
in
his
attitude
i
am
reminded
the
president
said
after
the
various
arguments
had
been
put
forward
by
the
members
of
the
cabinet
of
a
fellow
out
in
my
state
of
illinois
who
happened
to
stray
into
a
church
while
a
revival
meeting
was
in
progress
to
be
truthful
this
individual
was
not
entirely
sober
and
with
that
instinct
which
seems
to
impel
all
men
in
his
condition
to
assume
a
prominent
part
in
proceedings
he
walked
up
the
aisle
to
the
very
front
pew
all
noticed
him
but
he
did
not
care
for
awhile
he
joined
audibly
in
the
singing
said
amen
at
the
close
of
the
prayers
but
drowsiness
overcoming
him
he
went
to
sleep
before
the
meeting
closed
the
pastor
asked
the
usual
questionwho
are
on
the
lords
sideand
the
congregation
arose
en
masse
when
he
asked
who
are
on
the
side
of
the
devil
the
sleeper
was
about
waking
up
he
heard
a
portion
of
the
interrogatory
and
seeing
the
minister
on
his
feet
arose
i
dont
exactly
understand
the
question
he
said
but
ill
stand
by
you
parson
to
the
last
but
it
seems
to
me
he
added
that
were
in
a
hopeless
minority
im
in
a
hopeless
minority
now
said
the
president
and
ill
have
to
admit
it
did
ye
ask
morrissey
yet
john
morrissey
the
noted
prize
fighter
was
the
boss
of
tammany
hall
during
the
civil
war
period
it
pleased
his
fancy
to
go
to
congress
and
his
obedient
constituents
sent
him
there
morrissey
was
such
an
absolute
despot
that
the
new
york
city
democracy
could
not
make
a
move
without
his
consent
and
many
of
the
tammanyites
were
so
afraid
of
him
that
they
would
not
even
enter
into
business
ventures
without
consulting
the
autocrat
president
lincoln
had
been
seriously
annoyed
by
some
of
his
generals
who
were
afraid
to
make
the
slightest
move
before
asking
advice
from
washington
one
commander
in
particular
was
so
cautious
that
he
telegraphed
the
war
department
upon
the
slightest
pretext
the
result
being
that
his
troops
were
lying
in
camp
doing
nothing
when
they
should
have
been
in
the
field
this
general
reminds
me
the
president
said
one
day
while
talking
to
secretary
stanton
at
the
war
department
of
a
story
i
once
heard
about
a
tammany
man
he
happened
to
meet
a
friend
also
a
member
of
tammany
on
the
street
and
in
the
course
of
the
talk
the
friend
who
was
beaming
with
smiles
and
good
nature
told
the
other
tammanyite
that
he
was
going
to
be
married
this
first
tammany
man
looked
more
serious
than
men
usually
do
upon
hearing
of
the
impending
happiness
of
a
friend
in
fact
his
face
seemed
to
take
on
a
look
of
anxiety
and
worry
aint
you
glad
to
know
that
im
to
get
married
demanded
the
second
tammanyite
somewhat
in
a
huff
of
course
i
am
was
the
reply
but
putting
his
mouth
close
to
the
ear
of
the
other
have
ye
asked
morrissey
yet
now
this
general
of
whom
we
are
speaking
wouldnt
dare
order
out
the
guard
without
asking
morrissey
concluded
the
president
got
the
laugh
on
douglas
at
one
time
when
lincoln
and
douglas
were
stumping
illinois
they
met
at
a
certain
town
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
would
have
a
joint
debate
douglas
was
the
first
speaker
and
in
the
course
of
his
talk
remarked
that
in
early
life
his
father
who
he
said
was
an
excellent
cooper
by
trade
apprenticed
him
out
to
learn
the
cabinet
business
this
was
too
good
for
lincoln
to
let
pass
so
when
his
turn
came
to
reply
he
said
i
had
understood
before
that
mr
douglas
had
been
bound
out
to
learn
the
cabinetmaking
business
which
is
all
well
enough
but
i
was
not
aware
until
now
that
his
father
was
a
cooper
i
have
no
doubt
however
that
he
was
one
and
i
am
certain
also
that
he
was
a
very
good
one
for
here
lincoln
gently
bowed
toward
douglas
he
has
made
one
of
the
best
whiskey
casks
i
have
ever
seen
as
douglas
was
a
short
heavyset
man
and
occasionally
imbibed
the
pith
of
the
joke
was
at
once
apparent
and
most
heartily
enjoyed
by
all
on
another
occasion
douglas
made
a
point
against
lincoln
by
telling
the
crowd
that
when
he
first
knew
lincoln
he
was
a
grocerykeeper
and
sold
whiskey
cigars
etc
mr
l
he
said
was
a
very
good
bartender
this
brought
the
laugh
on
lincoln
whose
reply
however
soon
came
and
then
the
laugh
was
on
the
other
side
what
mr
douglas
has
said
gentlemen
replied
lincoln
is
true
enough
i
did
keep
a
grocery
and
i
did
sell
cotton
candles
and
cigars
and
sometimes
whiskey
but
i
remember
in
those
days
that
mr
douglas
was
one
of
my
best
customers
i
can
also
say
this
that
i
have
since
left
my
side
of
the
counter
while
mr
douglas
still
sticks
to
his
this
brought
such
a
storm
of
cheers
and
laughter
that
douglas
was
unable
to
reply
fixed
up
a
bit
for
the
city
folks
mrs
lincoln
knew
her
husband
was
not
pretty
but
she
liked
to
have
him
presentable
when
he
appeared
before
the
public
stephen
fiske
in
when
lincoln
was
first
inaugurated
tells
of
mrs
lincolns
anxiety
to
have
the
presidentelect
smoothed
down
a
little
when
receiving
a
delegation
that
was
to
greet
them
upon
reaching
new
york
city
the
train
stopped
writes
mr
fiske
and
through
the
windows
immense
crowds
could
be
seen
the
cheering
drowning
the
blowing
off
of
steam
of
the
locomotive
then
mrs
lincoln
opened
her
handbag
and
said
abraham
i
must
fix
you
up
a
bit
for
these
city
folks
mr
lincoln
gently
lifted
her
upon
the
seat
before
him
she
parted
combed
and
brushed
his
hair
and
arranged
his
black
necktie
do
i
look
nice
now
mother
he
affectionately
asked
well
youll
do
abraham
replied
mrs
lincoln
critically
so
he
kissed
her
and
lifted
her
down
from
the
seat
and
turned
to
meet
mayor
wood
courtly
and
suave
and
to
have
his
hand
shaken
by
the
other
new
york
officials
even
rebels
ought
to
be
saved
the
rev
mr
shrigley
of
philadelphia
a
universalist
had
been
nominated
for
hospital
chaplain
and
a
protesting
delegation
went
to
washington
to
see
president
lincoln
on
the
subject
we
have
called
mr
president
to
confer
with
you
in
regard
to
the
appointment
of
mr
shrigley
of
philadelphia
as
hospital
chaplain
the
president
responded
oh
yes
gentlemen
i
have
sent
his
name
to
the
senate
and
he
will
no
doubt
be
confirmed
at
an
early
date
one
of
the
young
men
replied
we
have
not
come
to
ask
for
the
appointment
but
to
solicit
you
to
withdraw
the
nomination
ah
said
lincoln
that
alters
the
case
but
on
what
grounds
do
you
wish
the
nomination
withdrawn
the
answer
was
mr
shrigley
is
not
sound
in
his
theological
opinions
the
president
inquired
on
what
question
is
the
gentleman
unsound
response
he
does
not
believe
in
endless
punishment
not
only
so
sir
but
he
believes
that
even
the
rebels
themselves
will
be
finally
saved
is
that
so
inquired
the
president
the
members
of
the
committee
responded
yes
yes
well
gentlemen
if
that
be
so
and
there
is
any
way
under
heaven
whereby
the
rebels
can
be
saved
then
for
gods
sake
and
their
sakes
let
the
man
be
appointed
the
rev
mr
shrigley
was
appointed
and
served
until
the
close
of
the
war
tried
to
do
what
seemed
best
john
m
palmer
majorgeneral
in
the
volunteer
army
governor
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
united
states
senator
from
the
sucker
state
became
acquainted
with
lincoln
in
and
the
last
time
he
saw
the
president
was
at
the
white
house
in
february
senator
palmer
told
the
story
of
his
interview
as
follows
i
had
come
to
washington
at
the
request
of
the
governor
to
complain
that
illinois
had
been
credited
with
too
few
troops
i
saw
mr
lincoln
one
afternoon
and
he
asked
me
to
come
again
in
the
morning
next
morning
i
sat
in
the
anteroom
while
several
officers
were
relieved
at
length
i
was
told
to
enter
the
presidents
room
mr
lincoln
was
in
the
hands
of
the
barber
come
in
palmer
he
called
out
come
in
youre
home
folks
i
can
shave
before
you
i
couldnt
before
those
others
and
i
have
to
do
it
some
time
we
chatted
about
various
matters
and
at
length
i
said
well
mr
lincoln
if
anybody
had
told
me
that
in
a
great
crisis
like
this
the
people
were
going
out
to
a
little
onehorse
town
and
pick
out
a
onehorse
lawyer
for
president
i
wouldnt
have
believed
it
mr
lincoln
whirled
about
in
his
chair
his
face
white
with
lather
a
towel
under
his
chin
at
first
i
thought
he
was
angry
sweeping
the
barber
away
he
leaned
forward
and
placing
one
hand
on
my
knee
said
neither
would
i
but
it
was
time
when
a
man
with
a
policy
would
have
been
fatal
to
the
country
i
have
never
had
a
policy
i
have
simply
tried
to
do
what
seemed
best
each
day
as
each
day
came
holding
a
candle
to
the
czar
england
was
anything
but
pleased
when
the
czar
alexander
of
russia
showed
his
friendship
for
the
united
states
by
sending
a
strong
fleet
to
this
country
with
the
accompanying
suggestion
that
uncle
sam
through
his
representative
president
lincoln
could
do
whatever
he
saw
fit
with
the
ironclads
and
the
munitions
of
war
they
had
stowed
away
in
their
holds
london
punch
on
november
th
printed
the
cartoon
shown
on
this
page
the
text
under
the
picture
reading
in
this
way
holding
a
candle
to
the
much
the
same
thing
of
course
this
was
a
covert
sneer
intended
to
convey
the
impression
that
president
lincoln
in
order
to
secure
the
support
and
friendship
of
the
emperor
of
russia
as
long
as
the
war
of
the
rebellion
lasted
was
willing
to
do
all
sorts
of
menial
offices
even
to
the
extent
of
holding
the
candle
and
lighting
his
most
gracious
majesty
the
white
czar
to
his
imperial
bedchamber
it
is
a
somewhat
remarkable
fact
that
the
emperor
alexander
who
tendered
inestimable
aid
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
the
lincoln
of
russia
having
given
freedom
to
millions
of
serfs
in
his
empire
and
further
than
that
he
was
like
lincoln
the
victim
of
assassination
he
was
literally
blown
to
pieces
by
a
bomb
thrown
under
his
carriage
while
riding
through
the
streets
near
the
winter
palace
at
st
petersburg
nashville
was
not
surrendered
i
was
told
a
mighty
good
story
said
the
president
one
day
at
a
cabinet
meeting
by
colonel
granville
moody
the
fighting
methodist
parson
as
they
used
to
call
him
in
tennessee
i
happened
to
meet
moody
in
philadelphia
where
he
was
attending
a
conference
the
story
was
about
andy
johnson
and
general
buell
colonel
moody
happened
to
be
in
nashville
the
day
it
was
reported
that
buell
had
decided
to
evacuate
the
city
the
rebels
strongly
reenforced
were
said
to
be
within
two
days
march
of
the
capital
of
course
the
city
was
greatly
excited
moody
said
he
went
in
search
of
johnson
at
the
edge
of
the
evening
and
found
him
at
his
office
closeted
with
two
gentlemen
who
were
walking
the
floor
with
him
one
on
each
side
as
he
entered
they
retired
leaving
him
alone
with
johnson
who
came
up
to
him
manifesting
intense
feeling
and
said
moody
we
are
sold
out
buell
is
a
traitor
he
is
going
to
evacuate
the
city
and
in
fortyeight
hours
we
will
all
be
in
the
hands
of
the
rebels
then
he
commenced
pacing
the
floor
again
twisting
his
hands
and
chafing
like
a
caged
tiger
utterly
insensible
to
his
friends
entreaties
to
become
calm
suddenly
he
turned
and
said
moody
can
you
pray
that
is
my
business
sir
as
a
minister
of
the
gospel
returned
the
colonel
well
moody
i
wish
you
would
pray
said
johnson
and
instantly
both
went
down
upon
their
knees
at
opposite
sides
of
the
room
as
the
prayer
waxed
fervent
johnson
began
to
respond
in
true
methodist
style
presently
he
crawled
over
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
moodys
side
and
put
his
arms
over
him
manifesting
the
deepest
emotion
closing
the
prayer
with
a
hearty
amen
from
each
they
arose
johnson
took
a
long
breath
and
said
with
emphasis
moody
i
feel
better
shortly
afterward
he
asked
will
you
stand
by
me
certainly
i
will
was
the
answer
well
moody
i
can
depend
upon
you
you
are
one
in
a
hundred
thousand
he
then
commenced
pacing
the
floor
again
suddenly
he
wheeled
the
current
of
his
thought
having
changed
and
said
oh
moody
i
dont
want
you
to
think
i
have
become
a
religious
man
because
i
asked
you
to
pray
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
i
am
not
and
never
pretended
to
be
religious
no
one
knows
this
better
than
you
but
moody
there
is
one
thing
about
it
i
do
believe
in
almighty
god
and
i
believe
also
in
the
bible
and
i
say
dn
me
if
nashville
shall
be
surrendered
and
nashville
was
not
surrendered
he
couldnt
wait
for
the
colonel
general
fisk
attending
a
reception
at
the
white
house
saw
waiting
in
the
anteroom
a
poor
old
man
from
tennessee
and
learned
that
he
had
been
waiting
three
or
four
days
to
get
an
audience
on
which
probably
depended
the
life
of
his
son
under
sentence
of
death
for
some
military
offense
general
fisk
wrote
his
case
in
outline
on
a
card
and
sent
it
in
with
a
a
special
request
that
the
president
would
see
the
man
in
a
moment
the
order
came
and
past
impatient
senators
governors
and
generals
the
old
man
went
he
showed
his
papers
to
mr
lincoln
who
said
he
would
look
into
the
case
and
give
him
the
result
next
day
the
old
man
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
looked
up
into
the
presidents
sympathetic
face
and
actually
cried
out
tomorrow
may
be
too
late
my
son
is
under
sentence
of
death
it
ought
to
be
decided
now
his
streaming
tears
told
how
much
he
was
moved
come
said
mr
lincoln
wait
a
bit
and
ill
tell
you
a
story
and
then
he
told
the
old
man
general
fisks
story
about
the
swearing
driver
as
follows
the
general
had
begun
his
military
life
as
a
colonel
and
when
he
raised
his
regiment
in
missouri
he
proposed
to
his
men
that
he
should
do
all
the
swearing
of
the
regiment
they
assented
and
for
months
no
instance
was
known
of
the
violation
of
the
promise
the
colonel
had
a
teamster
named
john
todd
who
as
roads
were
not
always
the
best
had
some
difficulty
in
commanding
his
temper
and
his
tongue
john
happened
to
be
driving
a
mule
team
through
a
series
of
mudholes
a
little
worse
than
usual
when
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
he
burst
forth
into
a
volley
of
energetic
oaths
the
colonel
took
notice
of
the
offense
and
brought
john
to
account
john
said
he
didnt
you
promise
to
let
me
do
all
the
swearing
of
the
regiment
yes
i
did
colonel
he
replied
but
the
fact
was
the
swearing
had
to
be
done
then
or
not
at
all
and
you
werent
there
to
do
it
as
he
told
the
story
the
old
man
forgot
his
boy
and
both
the
president
and
his
listener
had
a
hearty
laugh
together
at
its
conclusion
then
he
wrote
a
few
words
which
the
old
man
read
and
in
which
he
found
new
occasion
for
tears
but
the
tears
were
tears
of
joy
for
the
words
saved
the
life
of
his
son
lincoln
pronounced
this
story
funny
the
president
was
heard
to
declare
one
day
that
the
story
given
below
was
one
of
the
funniest
he
ever
heard
one
of
general
fremonts
batteries
of
eight
parrott
guns
supported
by
a
squadron
of
horse
commanded
by
major
richards
was
in
sharp
conflict
with
a
battery
of
the
enemy
near
at
hand
shells
and
shot
were
flying
thick
and
fast
when
the
commander
of
the
battery
a
german
one
of
fremonts
staff
rode
suddenly
up
to
the
cavalry
exclaiming
in
loud
and
excited
terms
pring
up
de
shackasses
pring
up
de
shackasses
for
cots
sake
hurry
up
de
shackasses
immediately
the
necessity
of
this
order
though
not
quite
apparent
will
be
more
obvious
when
it
is
remembered
that
shackasses
are
mules
carry
mountain
howitzers
which
are
fired
from
the
backs
of
that
muchabused
but
valuable
animal
and
the
immediate
occasion
for
the
shackasses
was
that
two
regiments
of
rebel
infantry
were
at
that
moment
discovered
ascending
a
hill
immediately
behind
our
batteries
the
shackasses
with
the
howitzers
loaded
with
grape
and
canister
were
soon
on
the
ground
the
mules
squared
themselves
as
they
well
knew
how
for
the
shock
a
terrific
volley
was
poured
into
the
advancing
column
which
immediately
broke
and
retreated
two
hundred
and
seventyeight
dead
bodies
were
found
in
the
ravine
next
day
piled
closely
together
as
they
fell
the
effects
of
that
volley
from
the
backs
of
the
shackasses
joke
was
on
lincoln
mr
lincoln
enjoyed
a
joke
at
his
own
expense
said
he
in
the
days
when
i
used
to
be
in
the
circuit
i
was
accosted
in
the
cars
by
a
stranger
who
said
excuse
me
sir
but
i
have
an
article
in
my
possession
which
belongs
to
you
how
is
that
i
asked
considerably
astonished
the
stranger
took
a
jackknife
from
his
pocket
this
knife
said
he
was
placed
in
my
hands
some
years
ago
with
the
injunction
that
i
was
to
keep
it
until
i
had
found
a
man
uglier
than
myself
i
have
carried
it
from
that
time
to
this
allow
me
to
say
sir
that
i
think
you
are
fairly
entitled
to
the
property
the
other
one
was
worse
it
so
happened
that
an
official
of
the
war
department
had
escaped
serious
punishment
for
a
rather
flagrant
offense
by
showing
where
grosser
irregularities
existed
in
the
management
of
a
certain
bureau
of
the
department
so
valuable
was
the
information
furnished
that
the
culprit
who
gave
the
snap
away
was
not
even
discharged
that
reminds
me
the
president
said
when
the
case
was
laid
before
him
of
a
story
about
daniel
webster
when
the
latter
was
a
boy
when
quite
young
at
school
daniel
was
one
day
guilty
of
a
gross
violation
of
the
rules
he
was
detected
in
the
act
and
called
up
by
the
teacher
for
punishment
this
was
to
be
the
oldfashioned
feruling
of
the
hand
his
hands
happened
to
be
very
dirty
knowing
this
on
the
way
to
the
teachers
desk
he
spit
upon
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
wiping
it
off
upon
the
side
of
his
pantaloons
give
me
your
hand
sir
said
the
teacher
very
sternly
out
went
the
right
hand
partly
cleansed
the
teacher
looked
at
it
a
moment
and
said
daniel
if
you
will
find
another
hand
in
this
schoolroom
as
filthy
as
that
i
will
let
you
off
this
time
instantly
from
behind
the
back
came
the
left
hand
here
it
is
sir
was
the
ready
reply
that
will
do
said
the
teacher
for
this
time
you
can
take
your
seat
sir
id
a
been
missed
by
mysef
the
president
did
not
consider
that
every
soldier
who
ran
away
in
battle
or
did
not
stand
firmly
to
receive
a
bayonet
charge
was
a
coward
he
was
of
opinion
that
selfpreservation
was
the
first
law
of
nature
but
he
didnt
want
this
statute
construed
too
liberally
by
the
troops
at
the
same
time
he
took
occasion
to
illustrate
a
point
he
wished
to
make
by
a
story
in
connection
with
a
darky
who
was
a
member
of
the
ninth
illinois
infantry
regiment
this
regiment
was
one
of
those
engaged
at
the
capture
of
fort
donelson
it
behaved
gallantly
and
lost
as
heavily
as
any
upon
the
hurricanedeck
of
one
of
our
gunboats
said
the
president
in
telling
the
story
i
saw
an
elderly
darky
with
a
very
philosophical
and
retrospective
cast
of
countenance
squatted
upon
his
bundle
toasting
his
shins
against
the
chimney
and
apparently
plunged
into
a
state
of
profound
meditation
as
the
negro
rather
interested
me
i
made
some
inquiries
and
found
that
he
had
really
been
with
the
ninth
illinois
infantry
at
donelson
and
began
to
ask
him
some
questions
about
the
capture
of
the
place
were
you
in
the
fight
had
a
little
taste
of
it
sa
stood
your
ground
did
you
no
sa
i
runs

fire
did
you
yes

and
would
hab
run

had
i
knowd
it

comin
why
that
wasnt
very
creditable
to
your
courage
dat
isnt
my

sacookins
my
profeshun
well
but
have
you
no
regard
for
your
reputation
reputations
nuffin
to
me
by
de
side
ob

do
you
consider
your
life
worth
more
than
other
peoples
its
worth
more
to
me
sa
then
you
must
value
it
very
highly
yes

and
dat
was
de
pint
wid
me
i
only
tell
this
story
concluded
the
president
in
order
to
illustrate
the
result
of
the
tactics
of
some
of
the
union
generals
who
would
be
sadly
missed
by
themselves
if
no
one
else
if
they
ever
got
out
of
the
army
it
all
depended
upon
the
effect
president
lincoln
and
some
members
of
his
cabinet
were
with
a
part
of
the
army
some
distance
south
of
the
national
capital
at
one
time
when
secretary
of
war
stanton
remarked
that
just
before
he
left
washington
he
had
received
a
telegram
from
general
mitchell
in
alabama
general
mitchell
asked
instructions
in
regard
to
a
certain
emergency
that
had
arisen
the
secretary
said
he
did
not
precisely
understand
the
emergency
as
explained
by
general
mitchell
but
had
answered
back
all
right
go
ahead
now
he
said
as
he
turned
to
mr
lincoln
mr
president
if
i
have
made
an
error
in
not
understanding
him
correctly
i
will
have
to
get
you
to
countermand
the
order
well
exclaimed
president
lincoln
that
is
very
much
like
the
happening
on
the
occasion
of
a
certain
horse
sale
i
remember
that
took
place
at
the
crossroads
down
in
kentucky
when
i
was
a
boy
a
particularly
fine
horse
was
to
be
sold
and
the
people
in
large
numbers
had
gathered
together
they
had
a
small
boy
to
ride
the
horse
up
and
down
while
the
spectators
examined
the
horses
points
at
last
one
man
whispered
to
the
boy
as
he
went
by
look
here
boy
haint
that
horse
got
the
splints
the
boy
replied
mister
i
dont
know
what
the
splints
is
but
if
its
good
for
him
he
has
got
it
if
it
aint
good
for
him
he
aint
got
it
now
said
president
lincoln
if
this
was
good
for
mitchell
it
was
all
right
but
if
it
was
not
i
have
got
to
countermand
it
too
swift
to
stay
in
the
army
there
were
strange
queer
odd
things
and
happenings
in
the
army
at
times
but
as
a
rule
the
president
did
not
allow
them
to
worry
him
he
had
enough
to
bother
about
a
quartermaster
having
neglected
to
present
his
accounts
in
proper
shape
and
the
matter
being
deemed
of
sufficient
importance
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
president
the
latter
remarked
now
this
instance
reminds
me
of
a
little
story
i
heard
only
a
short
time
ago
a
certain
generals
purse
was
getting
low
and
he
said
it
was
probable
he
might
be
obliged
to
draw
on
his
banker
for
some
money
how
much
do
you
want
father
asked
his
son
who
had
been
with
him
a
few
days
i
think
i
shall
send
for
a
couple
of
hundred
replied
the
general
why
father
said
his
son
very
quietly
i
can
let
you
have
it
you
can
let
me
have
it
where
did
you
get
so
much
money
i
won
it
playing
drawpoker
with
your
staff
sir
replied
the
youth
the
earliest
morning
train
bore
the
young
man
toward
his
home
and
ive
been
wondering
if
that
boy
and
that
quartermaster
had
happened
to
meet
at
the
same
table
admired
the
strong
man
governor
hoyt
of
wisconsin
tells
a
story
of
mr
lincolns
great
admiration
for
physical
strength
mr
lincoln
in
made
a
speech
at
the
wisconsin
state
agricultural
fair
after
the
speech
in
company
with
the
governor
he
strolled
about
the
grounds
looking
at
the
exhibits
they
came
to
a
place
where
a
professional
strong
man
was
tossing
cannon
balls
in
the
air
and
catching
them
on
his
arms
and
juggling
with
them
as
though
they
were
light
as
baseballs
mr
lincoln
had
never
before
seen
such
an
exhibition
and
he
was
greatly
surprised
and
interested
when
the
performance
was
over
governor
hoyt
seeing
mr
lincolns
interest
asked
him
to
go
up
and
be
introduced
to
the
athlete
he
did
so
and
as
he
stood
looking
down
musingly
on
the
man
who
was
very
short
and
evidently
wondering
that
one
so
much
smaller
than
he
could
be
so
much
stronger
he
suddenly
broke
out
with
one
of
his
quaint
speeches
why
he
said
why
i
could
lick
salt
off
the
top
of
your
hat
wished
the
army
charged
like
that
a
prominent
volunteer
officer
who
early
in
the
war
was
on
duty
in
washington
and
often
carried
reports
to
secretary
stanton
at
the
war
department
told
a
characteristic
story
on
president
lincoln
said
he
i
was
with
several
other
young
officers
also
carrying
reports
to
the
war
department
and
one
morning
we
were
late
in
this
instance
we
were
in
a
desperate
hurry
to
deliver
the
papers
in
order
to
be
able
to
catch
the
train
returning
to
camp
on
the
winding
dark
staircase
of
the
old
war
department
which
many
will
remember
it
was
our
misfortune
while
taking
about
three
stairs
at
a
time
to
run
a
certain
head
like
a
catapult
into
the
body
of
the
president
striking
him
in
the
region
of
the
right
lower
vest
pocket
the
usual
surprised
and
relaxed
grunt
of
a
man
thus
assailed
came
promptly
we
quickly
sent
an
apology
in
the
direction
of
the
dimly
seen
form
feeling
that
the
ungracious
shock
was
expensive
even
to
the
humblest
clerk
in
the
department
a
second
glance
revealed
to
us
the
president
as
the
victim
of
the
collision
then
followed
a
special
tender
of
ten
thousand
pardons
and
the
presidents
reply
ones
enough
i
wish
the
whole
army
would
charge
like
that
uncle
abraham
had
everything
ready
you
cant
do
anything
with
them
southern
fellows
the
old
man
at
the
table
was
saying
if
they
get
whipped
theyll
retreat
to
them
southern
swamps
and
bayous
along
with
the
fishes
and
crocodiles
you
havent
got
the
fishnets
made
thatll
catch
em
look
here
old
gentleman
remarked
president
lincoln
who
was
sitting
alongside
weve
got
just
the
nets
for
traitors
in
the
bayous
or
anywhere
hey
what
nets
bayounets
and
uncle
abraham
pointed
his
joke
with
his
fork
spearing
a
fishball
savagely
not
as
smooth
as
he
looked
mr
lincolns
skill
in
parrying
troublesome
questions
was
wonderful
once
he
received
a
call
from
congressman
john
ganson
of
buffalo
one
of
the
ablest
lawyers
in
new
york
who
although
a
democrat
supported
all
of
mr
lincolns
war
measures
mr
ganson
wanted
explanations
mr
ganson
was
very
bald
with
a
perfectly
smooth
face
he
had
a
most
direct
and
aggressive
way
of
stating
his
views
or
of
demanding
what
he
thought
he
was
entitled
to
he
said
mr
lincoln
i
have
supported
all
of
your
measures
and
think
i
am
entitled
to
your
confidence
we
are
voting
and
acting
in
the
dark
in
congress
and
i
demand
to
knowthink
i
have
the
right
to
ask
and
to
knowwhat
is
the
present
situation
and
what
are
the
prospects
and
conditions
of
the
several
campaigns
and
armies
mr
lincoln
looked
at
him
critically
for
a
moment
and
then
said
ganson
how
clean
you
shave
most
men
would
have
been
offended
but
ganson
was
too
broad
and
intelligent
a
man
not
to
see
the
point
and
retire
at
once
satisfied
from
the
field
a
small
crop
chauncey
m
depew
says
that
mr
lincoln
told
him
the
following
story
which
he
claimed
was
one
of
the
best
two
things
he
ever
originated
he
was
trying
a
case
in
illinois
where
he
appeared
for
a
prisoner
charged
with
aggravated
assault
and
battery
the
complainant
had
told
a
horrible
story
of
the
attack
which
his
appearance
fully
justified
when
the
district
attorney
handed
the
witness
over
to
mr
lincoln
for
crossexamination
mr
lincoln
said
he
had
no
testimony
and
unless
he
could
break
down
the
complainants
story
he
saw
no
way
out
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
witness
was
a
bumptious
man
who
rather
prided
himself
upon
his
smartness
in
repartee
and
so
after
looking
at
him
for
some
minutes
he
said
well
my
friend
how
much
ground
did
you
and
my
client
here
fight
over
the
fellow
answered
about
six
acres
well
said
mr
lincoln
dont
you
think
that
this
is
an
almighty
small
crop
of
fight
to
gather
from
such
a
big
piece
of
ground
the
jury
laughed
the
court
and
districtattorney
and
complainant
all
joined
in
and
the
case
was
laughed
out
of
court
never
regret
what
you
dont
write
a
simple
remark
one
of
the
party
might
make
would
remind
mr
lincoln
of
an
apropos
story
secretary
of
the
treasury
chase
happened
to
remark
oh
i
am
so
sorry
that
i
did
not
write
a
letter
to
mr
soandso
before
i
left
home
president
lincoln
promptly
responded
chase
never
regret
what
you
dont
write
it
is
what
you
do
write
that
you
are
often
called
upon
to
feel
sorry
for
a
vain
general
in
an
interview
between
president
lincoln
and
petroleum
v
nasby
the
name
came
up
of
a
recently
deceased
politician
of
illinois
whose
merit
was
blemished
by
great
vanity
his
funeral
was
very
largely
attended
if
general
had
known
how
big
a
funeral
he
would
have
had
said
mr
lincoln
he
would
have
died
years
ago
death
bed
repentance
a
senator
who
was
calling
upon
mr
lincoln
mentioned
the
name
of
a
most
virulent
and
dishonest
official
one
who
though
very
brilliant
was
very
bad
its
a
good
thing
for
b
said
mr
lincoln
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
deathbed
repentance
no
cause
for
pride
a
member
of
congress
from
ohio
came
into
mr
lincolns
presence
in
a
state
of
unutterable
intoxication
and
sinking
into
a
chair
exclaimed
in
tones
that
welled
up
fuzzy
through
the
gallon
or
more
of
whiskey
that
he
contained
oh
why
should
hic
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
my
dear
sir
said
the
president
regarding
him
closely
i
see
no
reason
whatever
the
story
of
lincolns
life
when
abraham
lincoln
once
was
asked
to
tell
the
story
of
his
life
he
replied
it
is
contained
in
one
line
of
grays
elegy
in
a
country
churchyard
the
short
and
simple
annals
of
the
poor
that
was
true
at
the
time
he
said
it
as
everything
else
he
said
was
truth
but
he
was
then
only
at
the
beginning
of
a
career
that
was
to
glorify
him
as
one
of
the
heroes
of
the
world
and
place
his
name
forever
beside
the
immortal
name
of
the
mighty
washington
many
great
men
particularly
those
of
america
began
life
in
humbleness
and
poverty
but
none
ever
came
from
such
depths
or
rose
to
such
a
height
as
abraham
lincoln
his
birthplace
in
hardin
county
kentucky
was
but
a
wilderness
and
spencer
county
indiana
to
which
the
lincoln
family
removed
when
abraham
was
in
his
eighth
year
was
a
wilder
and
still
more
uncivilized
region
the
little
red
schoolhouse
which
now
so
thickly
adorns
the
country
hillside
had
not
yet
been
built
there
were
scattered
log
schoolhouses
but
they
were
few
and
far
between
in
several
of
these
mr
lincoln
got
the
rudiments
of
an
educationan
education
that
was
never
finished
for
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
was
a
student
and
a
seeker
after
knowledge
some
records
of
his
schoolboy
days
are
still
left
us
one
is
a
book
made
and
bound
by
lincoln
himself
in
which
he
had
written
the
table
of
weights
and
measures
and
the
sums
to
be
worked
out
therefrom
this
was
his
arithmetic
for
he
was
too
poor
to
own
a
printed
copy
a
youthful
poet
on
one
of
the
pages
of
this
quaint
book
he
had
written
these
four
lines
of
schoolboy
doggerel
abraham
lincoln
his
hand
and
pen
he
will
be
good
but
god
knows
when
the
poetic
spirit
was
strong
in
the
young
scholar
just
then
for
on
another
page
of
the
same
book
he
had
written
these
two
verses
which
are
supposed
to
have
been
original
with
him
time
what
an
empty
vapor
tis
and
days
how
swift
they
are
swift
as
an
indian
arrow
fly
on
like
a
shooting
star
the
present
moment
just
is
here
then
slides
away
in
haste
that
we
can
never
say
theyre
ours
but
only
say
theyre
past
another
specimen
of
the
poetical
or
rhyming
ability
is
found
in
the
following
couplet
written
by
him
for
his
friend
joseph
c
richardson
good
boys
who
to
their
books
apply
will
all
be
great
men
by
and
by
in
all
lincolns
schooling
did
not
amount
to
a
years
time
but
he
was
a
constant
student
outside
of
the
schoolhouse
he
read
all
the
books
he
could
borrow
and
it
was
his
chief
delight
during
the
day
to
lie
under
the
shade
of
some
tree
or
at
night
in
front
of
an
open
fireplace
reading
and
studying
his
favorite
books
were
the
bible
and
aesops
fables
which
he
kept
always
within
reach
and
read
time
and
again
the
first
law
book
he
ever
read
was
the
statutes
of
indiana
and
it
was
from
this
work
that
he
derived
his
ambition
to
be
a
lawyer
made
speeches
when
a
boy
when
he
was
but
a
barefoot
boy
he
would
often
make
political
speeches
to
the
boys
in
the
neighborhood
and
when
he
had
reached
young
manhood
and
was
engaged
in
the
labor
of
chopping
wood
or
splitting
rails
he
continued
this
practice
of
speechmaking
with
only
the
stumps
and
surrounding
trees
for
hearers
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
had
attained
his
full
height
of
six
feet
four
inches
and
it
was
at
this
time
he
engaged
as
a
ferry
boatman
on
the
ohio
river
at
thirtyseven
cents
a
day
that
he
was
seriously
beginning
to
think
of
public
affairs
even
at
this
early
age
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
about
this
time
he
wrote
a
composition
on
the
american
government
urging
the
necessity
for
preserving
the
constitution
and
perpetuating
the
union
a
rockport
lawyer
by
the
name
of
pickert
who
read
this
composition
declared
that
the
world
couldnt
beat
it
when
the
dreaded
disease
known
as
the
milksick
created
such
havoc
in
indiana
in
the
father
of
abraham
lincoln
who
was
of
a
roving
disposition
sought
and
found
a
new
home
in
illinois
locating
near
the
town
of
decatur
in
macon
county
on
a
bluff
overlooking
the
sangamon
river
a
short
time
thereafter
abraham
lincoln
came
of
age
and
having
done
his
duty
to
his
father
began
life
on
his
own
account
his
first
employer
was
a
man
named
denton
offut
who
engaged
lincoln
together
with
his
stepbrother
and
john
hanks
to
take
a
boatload
of
stock
and
provisions
to
new
orleans
offut
was
so
well
pleased
with
the
energy
and
skill
that
lincoln
displayed
on
this
trip
that
he
engaged
him
as
clerk
in
a
store
which
offut
opened
a
few
months
later
at
new
salem
it
was
while
clerking
for
offut
that
lincoln
performed
many
of
those
marvelous
feats
of
strength
for
which
he
was
noted
in
his
youth
and
displayed
his
wonderful
skill
as
a
wrestler
in
addition
to
being
six
feet
four
inches
high
he
now
weighed
two
hundred
and
fourteen
pounds
and
his
strength
and
skill
were
so
great
combined
that
he
could
outwrestle
and
outlift
any
man
in
that
section
of
the
country
during
his
clerkship
in
offuts
store
lincoln
continued
to
read
and
study
and
made
considerable
progress
in
grammar
and
mathematics
offut
failed
in
business
and
disappeared
from
the
village
in
the
language
of
lincoln
he
petered
out
and
his
tall
muscular
clerk
had
to
seek
other
employment
assistant
pilot
on
a
steamboat
in
his
first
public
speech
which
had
already
been
delivered
lincoln
had
contended
that
the
sangamon
river
was
navigable
and
it
now
fell
to
his
lot
to
assist
in
giving
practical
proof
of
his
argument
a
steamboat
had
arrived
at
new
salem
from
cincinnati
and
lincoln
was
hired
as
an
assistant
in
piloting
the
vessel
through
the
uncertain
channel
of
the
sangamon
river
to
the
illinois
river
the
way
was
obstructed
by
a
milldam
lincoln
insisted
to
the
owners
of
the
dam
that
under
the
federal
constitution
and
laws
no
one
had
a
right
to
dam
up
or
obstruct
a
navigable
stream
and
as
he
had
already
proved
that
the
sangamon
was
navigable
a
portion
of
the
dam
was
torn
away
and
the
boat
passed
safely
through
captain
lincoln
pleased
him
at
this
period
in
his
career
the
blackhawk
war
broke
out
and
lincoln
was
one
of
the
first
to
respond
to
governor
reynolds
call
for
a
thousand
mounted
volunteers
to
assist
the
united
states
troops
in
driving
blackhawk
back
across
the
mississippi
lincoln
enlisted
in
the
company
from
sangamon
county
and
was
elected
captain
he
often
remarked
that
this
gave
him
greater
pleasure
than
anything
that
had
happened
in
his
life
up
to
this
time
he
had
however
no
opportunities
in
this
war
to
perform
any
distinguished
service
upon
his
return
from
the
blackhawk
war
in
which
as
he
said
afterward
in
a
humorous
speech
when
in
congress
that
he
fought
bled
and
came
away
he
was
an
unsuccessful
candidate
for
the
legislature
this
was
the
only
time
in
his
life
as
he
himself
has
said
that
he
was
ever
beaten
by
the
people
although
defeated
in
his
own
town
of
new
salem
he
received
all
of
the
two
hundred
and
eight
votes
cast
except
three
failure
as
a
business
man
lincolns
next
business
venture
was
with
william
berry
in
a
general
store
under
the
firm
name
of
lincoln
berry
but
did
not
take
long
to
show
that
he
was
not
adapted
for
a
business
career
the
firm
failed
berry
died
and
the
debts
of
the
firm
fell
entirely
upon
lincoln
many
of
these
debts
he
might
have
escaped
legally
but
he
assumed
them
all
and
it
was
not
until
fifteen
years
later
that
the
last
indebtedness
of
lincoln
berry
was
discharged
during
his
membership
in
this
firm
he
had
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
law
beginning
at
the
beginning
that
is
with
blackstone
now
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
spent
much
of
his
time
lying
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
poring
over
law
books
borrowed
from
a
comrade
in
the
blackhawk
war
who
was
then
a
practicing
lawyer
at
springfield
gains
fame
as
a
story
teller
it
was
about
this
time
too
that
lincolns
fame
as
a
storyteller
began
to
spread
far
and
wide
his
sayings
and
his
jokes
were
repeated
throughout
that
section
of
the
country
and
he
was
famous
as
a
storyteller
before
anyone
ever
heard
of
him
as
a
lawyer
or
a
politician
it
required
no
little
moral
courage
to
resist
the
temptation
that
beset
an
idle
young
man
on
every
hand
at
that
time
for
drinking
and
carousing
were
of
daily
and
nightly
occurrence
lincoln
never
drank
intoxicating
liquors
nor
did
he
at
that
time
use
tobacco
but
in
any
sports
that
called
for
skill
or
muscle
he
took
a
lively
interest
even
in
horse
races
and
cock
fights
surveyor
with
no
strings
on
him
john
calhoun
was
at
that
time
surveyor
of
sangamon
county
he
had
been
a
lawyer
and
had
noticed
the
studious
lincoln
needing
an
assistant
he
offered
the
place
to
lincoln
the
average
young
man
without
any
regular
employment
and
hardpressed
for
means
to
pay
his
board
as
lincoln
was
would
have
jumped
at
the
opportunity
but
a
question
of
principle
was
involved
which
had
to
be
settled
before
lincoln
would
accept
calhoun
was
a
democrat
and
lincoln
was
a
whig
therefore
lincoln
said
i
will
take
the
office
if
i
can
be
perfectly
free
in
my
political
actions
but
if
my
sentiments
or
even
expression
of
them
are
to
be
abridged
in
any
way
i
would
not
have
it
or
any
other
office
with
this
understanding
he
accepted
the
office
and
began
to
study
books
on
surveying
furnished
him
by
his
employer
he
was
not
a
natural
mathematician
and
in
working
out
his
most
difficult
problems
he
sought
the
assistance
of
mentor
graham
a
famous
schoolmaster
in
those
days
who
had
previously
assisted
lincoln
in
his
studies
he
soon
became
a
competent
surveyor
however
and
was
noted
for
the
accurate
way
in
which
he
ran
his
lines
and
located
his
corners
surveying
was
not
as
profitable
then
as
it
has
since
become
and
the
young
surveyor
often
had
to
take
his
pay
in
some
article
other
than
money
one
old
settler
relates
that
for
a
survey
made
for
him
by
lincoln
he
paid
two
buckskins
which
hannah
armstrong
foxed
on
his
pants
so
that
the
briars
would
not
wear
them
out
about
this
time
he
was
made
postmaster
at
new
salem
the
first
federal
office
he
ever
held
although
the
postoffice
was
located
in
a
store
lincoln
usually
carried
the
mail
around
in
his
hat
and
distributed
it
to
people
when
he
met
them
a
member
of
the
legislature
the
following
year
lincoln
again
ran
for
the
legislature
this
time
as
an
avowed
whig
of
the
four
successful
candidates
lincoln
received
the
second
highest
number
of
votes
when
lincoln
went
to
take
his
seat
in
the
legislature
at
vandalia
he
was
so
poor
that
he
was
obliged
to
borrow
to
buy
suitable
clothes
and
uphold
the
dignity
of
his
new
position
he
took
little
part
in
the
proceedings
keeping
in
the
background
but
forming
many
lasting
acquaintances
and
friendships
two
years
later
when
he
was
again
a
candidate
for
the
same
office
there
were
more
political
issues
to
be
met
and
lincoln
met
them
with
characteristic
honesty
and
boldness
during
the
campaign
he
issued
the
following
letter
new
salem
june
to
the
editor
of

very
respectfully
a
lincoln
this
was
just
the
sort
of
letter
to
win
the
support
of
the
plainspoken
voters
of
sangamon
county
lincoln
not
only
received
more
votes
than
any
other
candidate
on
the
legislative
ticket
but
the
county
which
had
always
been
democratic
was
turned
whig
the
famous
long
nine
the
other
candidates
elected
with
lincoln
were
ninian
w
edwards
john
dawson
andrew
mccormick
dan
stone
william
f
elkin
robert
l
wilson
joe
fletcher
and
archer
g
herndon
these
were
known
as
the
long
nine
their
average
height
was
six
feet
and
average
weight
two
hundred
pounds
this
legislature
was
one
of
the
most
famous
that
ever
convened
in
illinois
bonds
to
the
amount
of
were
voted
to
assist
in
building
thirteen
hundred
miles
of
railroad
to
widen
and
deepen
all
the
streams
in
the
state
and
to
dig
a
canal
from
the
illinois
river
to
lake
michigan
lincoln
favored
all
these
plans
but
in
justice
to
him
it
must
be
said
that
the
people
he
represented
were
also
in
favor
of
them
it
was
at
this
session
that
the
state
capital
was
changed
from
vandalia
to
springfield
lincoln
as
the
leader
of
the
long
nine
had
charge
of
the
bill
and
after
a
long
and
bitter
struggle
succeeded
in
passing
it
begins
to
oppose
slavery
at
this
early
stage
in
his
career
abraham
lincoln
began
his
opposition
to
slavery
which
eventually
resulted
in
his
giving
liberty
to
four
million
human
beings
this
legislature
passed
the
following
resolutions
on
slavery
resolved
by
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
we
highly
disapprove
of
the
formation
of
abolition
societies
and
of
the
doctrines
promulgated
by
them
that
the
right
of
property
in
slaves
is
sacred
to
the
slaveholding
states
by
the
federal
constitution
and
that
they
cannot
be
deprived
of
that
right
without
their
consent
that
the
general
government
cannot
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
against
the
consent
of
the
citizens
of
said
district
without
a
manifest
breach
of
good
faith
against
this
resolution
lincoln
entered
a
protest
but
only
succeeded
in
getting
one
man
in
the
legislature
to
sign
the
protest
with
him
the
protest
was
as
follows
resolutions
upon
the
subject
of
domestic
slavery
having
passed
both
branches
of
the
general
assembly
at
its
present
session
the
undersigned
hereby
protest
against
the
passage
of
the
same
they
believe
that
the
institution
of
slavery
is
founded
on
both
injustice
and
bad
policy
but
that
the
promulgation
of
abolition
doctrines
tends
rather
o
increase
than
abate
its
evils
they
believe
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
no
power
under
the
constitution
to
interfere
with
the
institution
of
slavery
in
the
different
states
they
believe
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
the
power
under
the
constitution
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
that
the
power
ought
not
to
be
exercised
unless
at
the
request
of
the
people
of
the
district
the
difference
between
these
opinions
and
those
contained
in
the
above
resolutions
is
their
reason
for
entering
this
protest
dan
stone
a
lincoln
representatives
from
the
county
of
sangamon
begins
to
practice
law
at
the
end
of
this
session
of
the
legislature
mr
lincoln
decided
to
remove
to
springfield
and
practice
law
he
entered
the
office
of
john
t
stuart
a
former
comrade
in
the
blackhawk
war
and
in
march
was
licensed
to
practice
stephen
t
logan
was
judge
of
the
circuit
court
and
stephen
a
douglas
who
was
destined
to
become
lincolns
greatest
political
opponent
was
prosecuting
attorney
when
lincoln
was
not
in
his
law
office
his
headquarters
were
in
the
store
of
his
friend
joshua
f
speed
in
which
gathered
all
the
youthful
orators
and
statesmen
of
that
day
and
where
many
exciting
arguments
and
discussions
were
held
lincoln
and
douglas
both
took
part
in
the
discussion
held
in
speeds
store
douglas
was
the
acknowledged
leader
of
the
democratic
side
and
lincoln
was
rapidly
coming
to
the
front
as
a
leader
among
the
whig
debaters
one
evening
in
the
midst
of
a
heated
argument
douglas
or
the
little
giant
as
he
was
called
exclaimed
this
store
is
no
place
to
talk
politics
his
first
joint
debate
arrangements
were
at
once
made
for
a
joint
debate
between
the
leading
democrats
and
whigs
to
take
place
in
a
local
church
the
democrats
were
represented
by
douglas
calhoun
lamborn
and
thomas
the
whig
speakers
were
judge
logan
colonel
e
d
baker
mr
browning
and
lincoln
this
discussion
was
the
forerunner
of
the
famous
jointdebate
between
lincoln
and
douglas
which
took
place
some
years
later
and
attracted
the
attention
of
the
people
throughout
the
united
states
although
mr
lincoln
was
the
last
speaker
in
the
first
discussion
held
his
speech
attracted
more
attention
than
any
of
the
others
and
added
much
to
his
reputation
as
a
public
debater
mr
lincolns
last
campaign
for
the
legislature
was
in
in
the
same
year
he
was
made
an
elector
on
the
harrison
presidential
ticket
and
in
his
canvass
of
the
state
frequently
met
the
democratic
champion
douglas
in
debate
after
mr
lincoln
declined
reelection
to
the
legislature
but
he
was
a
presidential
elector
on
the
whig
tickets
of
and
and
on
the
republican
ticket
for
the
state
at
large
in
marries
a
springfield
belle
among
the
social
belles
of
springfield
was
mary
todd
a
handsome
and
cultivated
girl
of
the
illustrious
descent
which
could
be
traced
back
to
the
sixth
century
to
whom
mr
lincoln
was
married
in
stephen
a
douglas
was
his
competitor
in
love
as
well
as
in
politics
he
courted
mary
todd
until
it
became
evident
that
she
preferred
mr
lincoln
previous
to
his
marriage
mr
lincoln
had
two
love
affairs
one
of
them
so
serious
that
it
left
an
impression
upon
his
whole
future
life
one
of
the
objects
of
his
affection
was
miss
mary
owen
of
green
county
kentucky
who
decided
that
mr
lincoln
was
deficient
in
those
little
links
which
make
up
the
chain
of
womans
happiness
the
affair
ended
without
any
damage
to
mr
lincolns
heart
or
the
heart
of
the
lady
story
of
anne
rutledge
lincolns
first
love
however
had
a
sad
termination
the
object
of
his
affections
at
that
time
was
anne
rutledge
whose
father
was
one
of
the
founders
of
new
salem
like
miss
owen
miss
rutledge
was
also
born
in
kentucky
and
was
gifted
with
the
beauty
and
graces
that
distinguish
many
southern
women
at
the
time
that
mr
lincoln
and
anne
rutledge
were
engaged
to
be
married
he
thought
himself
too
poor
to
properly
support
a
wife
and
they
decided
to
wait
until
such
time
as
he
could
better
his
financial
condition
a
short
time
thereafter
miss
rutledge
was
attacked
with
a
fatal
illness
and
her
death
was
such
a
blow
to
her
intended
husband
that
for
a
long
time
his
friends
feared
that
he
would
lose
his
mind
his
duel
with
shields
just
previous
to
his
marriage
with
mary
todd
mr
lincoln
was
challenged
to
fight
a
duel
by
james
shields
then
auditor
of
state
the
challenge
grew
out
of
some
humorous
letters
concerning
shields
published
in
a
local
paper
the
first
of
these
letters
was
written
by
mr
lincoln
the
others
by
mary
todd
and
her
sister
mr
lincoln
acknowledged
the
authorship
of
the
letters
without
naming
the
ladies
and
agreed
to
meet
shields
on
the
field
of
honor
as
he
had
the
choice
of
weapons
he
named
broadswords
and
actually
went
to
the
place
selected
for
the
duel
the
duel
was
never
fought
mutual
friends
got
together
and
patched
up
an
understanding
between
mr
lincoln
and
the
hotheaded
irishman
forms
new
partnership
before
this
time
mr
lincoln
had
dissolved
partnership
with
stuart
and
entered
into
a
law
partnership
with
judge
logan
in
both
lincoln
and
logan
were
candidates
for
nomination
for
congress
and
the
personal
illwill
caused
by
their
rivalry
resulted
in
the
dissolution
of
the
firm
and
the
formation
of
a
new
law
firm
of
lincoln
herndon
which
continued
nominally
at
least
until
mr
lincolns
death
the
congressional
nomination
however
went
to
edward
d
baker
who
was
elected
two
years
later
the
principal
candidates
for
the
whig
nomination
for
congress
were
mr
lincoln
and
his
former
law
partner
judge
logan
party
sentiment
was
so
strongly
in
favor
of
lincoln
that
judge
logan
withdrew
and
lincoln
was
nominated
unanimously
the
campaign
that
followed
was
one
of
the
most
memorable
and
interesting
ever
held
in
illinois
defeats
peter
cartwright
for
congress
mr
lincolns
opponent
on
the
democratic
ticket
was
no
less
a
person
than
old
peter
cartwright
the
famous
methodist
preacher
and
circuit
rider
cartwright
had
preached
to
almost
every
congregation
in
the
district
and
had
a
strong
following
in
all
the
churches
mr
lincoln
did
not
underestimate
the
strength
of
his
great
rival
he
abandoned
his
law
business
entirely
and
gave
his
whole
attention
to
the
canvass
this
time
mr
lincoln
was
victorious
and
was
elected
by
a
large
majority
when
lincoln
took
his
seat
in
congress
in
he
was
the
only
whig
member
from
illinois
his
great
political
rival
douglas
was
in
the
senate
the
mexican
war
had
already
broken
out
which
in
common
with
his
party
he
had
opposed
later
in
life
he
was
charged
with
having
opposed
the
voting
of
supplies
to
the
american
troops
in
mexico
but
this
was
a
falsehood
which
he
easily
disproved
he
was
strongly
opposed
to
the
war
but
after
it
was
once
begun
he
urged
its
vigorous
prosecution
and
voted
with
the
democrats
on
all
measures
concerning
the
care
and
pay
of
the
soldiers
his
opposition
to
the
war
however
cost
him
a
reelection
it
cost
his
party
the
congressional
district
which
was
carried
by
the
democrats
in
lincolns
former
law
partner
judge
logan
secured
the
whig
nomination
that
year
and
was
defeated
makes
speeches
for
old
zach
in
the
national
convention
at
philadelphia
in
mr
lincoln
was
a
delegate
and
advocated
the
nomination
of
general
taylor
after
the
nomination
of
general
taylor
or
old
zach
or
rough
and
ready
as
he
was
called
mr
lincoln
made
a
tour
of
new
york
and
several
new
england
states
making
speeches
for
his
candidate
mr
lincoln
went
to
new
england
in
this
campaign
on
account
of
the
great
defection
in
the
whig
party
general
taylors
nomination
was
unsatisfactory
to
the
freesoil
element
and
such
leaders
as
henry
wilson
charles
francis
adams
charles
allen
charles
sumner
stephen
c
phillips
richard
h
dana
jr
and
anson
burlingame
were
in
open
revolt
mr
lincolns
speeches
were
confined
largely
to
a
defense
of
general
taylor
but
at
the
same
time
he
denounced
the
freesoilers
for
helping
to
elect
cass
among
other
things
he
said
that
the
freesoilers
had
but
one
principle
and
that
they
reminded
him
of
the
yankee
peddler
going
to
sell
a
pair
of
pantaloons
and
describing
them
as
large
enough
for
any
man
and
small
enough
for
any
boy
it
is
an
odd
fact
in
history
that
the
prominent
whigs
of
massachusetts
at
that
time
became
the
opponents
of
mr
lincolns
election
to
the
presidency
and
the
policy
of
his
administration
while
the
freesoilers
whom
he
denounced
were
among
his
strongest
supporters
advisers
and
followers
at
the
second
session
of
congress
mr
lincolns
one
act
of
consequence
was
the
introduction
of
a
bill
providing
for
the
gradual
emancipation
of
the
slaves
in
the
district
of
columbia
joshua
r
giddings
the
great
antislavery
agitator
and
one
or
two
lesser
lights
supported
it
but
the
bill
was
laid
on
the
table
after
general
taylors
election
mr
lincoln
had
the
distribution
of
federal
patronage
in
his
own
congressional
district
and
this
added
much
to
his
political
importance
although
it
was
a
ceaseless
source
of
worry
to
him
declines
a
high
office
just
before
the
close
of
his
term
in
congress
mr
lincoln
was
an
applicant
for
the
office
of
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
but
was
unsuccessful
he
had
been
such
a
factor
in
general
taylors
election
that
the
administration
thought
something
was
due
him
and
after
his
return
to
illinois
he
was
called
to
washington
and
offered
the
governorship
of
the
territory
of
oregon
it
is
likely
he
would
have
accepted
this
had
not
mrs
lincoln
put
her
foot
down
with
an
emphatic
no
he
declined
a
partnership
with
a
wellknown
chicago
lawyer
and
returning
to
his
springfield
home
resumed
the
practice
of
law
from
this
time
until
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
which
opened
the
way
for
the
admission
of
slavery
into
the
territories
mr
lincoln
devoted
himself
more
industriously
than
ever
to
the
practice
of
law
and
during
those
five
years
he
was
probably
a
greater
student
than
he
had
ever
been
before
his
partner
w
h
herndon
has
told
of
the
changes
that
took
place
in
the
courts
and
in
the
methods
of
practice
while
mr
lincoln
was
away
lincoln
as
a
lawyer
when
he
returned
to
active
practice
he
saw
at
once
that
the
courts
had
grown
more
learned
and
dignified
and
that
the
bar
relied
more
upon
method
and
system
and
a
knowledge
of
the
statute
law
than
upon
the
stump
speech
method
of
early
days
mr
herndon
tells
us
that
lincoln
would
lie
in
bed
and
read
by
candle
light
sometimes
until
two
oclock
in
the
morning
while
his
famous
colleagues
davis
logan
swett
edwards
and
herndon
were
soundly
and
sometimes
loudly
sleeping
he
read
and
reread
the
statutes
and
books
of
practice
devoured
shakespeare
who
was
always
a
favorite
of
his
and
studied
euclid
so
diligently
that
he
could
easily
demonstrate
all
the
propositions
contained
in
the
six
books
mr
lincoln
detested
office
work
he
left
all
that
to
his
partner
he
disliked
to
draw
up
legal
papers
or
to
write
letters
the
firm
of
which
he
was
a
member
kept
no
books
when
either
lincoln
or
herndon
received
a
fee
they
divided
the
money
then
and
there
if
his
partner
were
not
in
the
office
at
the
time
mr
lincoln
would
wrap
up
half
of
the
fee
in
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
would
write
herndons
half
giving
the
name
of
the
case
and
place
it
in
his
partners
desk
but
in
court
arguing
a
case
pleading
to
the
jury
and
laying
down
the
law
lincoln
was
in
his
element
even
when
he
had
a
weak
case
he
was
a
strong
antagonist
and
when
he
had
right
and
justice
on
his
side
as
he
nearly
always
had
no
one
could
beat
him
he
liked
an
outdoor
life
hence
he
was
fond
of
riding
the
circuit
he
enjoyed
the
company
of
other
men
liked
discussion
and
argument
loved
to
tell
stories
and
to
hear
them
laughing
as
heartily
at
his
own
stories
as
he
did
at
those
that
were
told
to
him
telling
stories
on
the
circuit
the
court
circuit
in
those
days
was
the
scene
of
many
a
storytelling
joust
in
which
lincoln
was
always
the
chief
frequently
he
would
sit
up
until
after
midnight
reeling
off
story
after
story
each
one
followed
by
roars
of
laughter
that
could
be
heard
all
over
the
country
tavern
in
which
the
storytelling
group
was
gathered
every
type
of
character
would
be
represented
in
these
groups
from
the
learned
judge
on
the
bench
down
to
the
village
loafer
lincolns
favorite
attitude
was
to
sit
with
his
long
legs
propped
up
on
the
rail
of
the
stove
or
with
his
feet
against
the
wall
and
thus
he
would
sit
for
hours
entertaining
a
crowd
or
being
entertained
one
circuit
judge
was
so
fond
of
lincolns
stories
that
he
often
would
sit
up
until
midnight
listening
to
them
and
then
declare
that
he
had
laughed
so
much
he
believed
his
ribs
were
shaken
loose
the
great
success
of
abraham
lincoln
as
a
trial
lawyer
was
due
to
a
number
of
facts
he
would
not
take
a
case
if
he
believed
that
the
law
and
justice
were
on
the
other
side
when
he
addressed
a
jury
he
made
them
feel
that
he
only
wanted
fair
play
and
justice
he
did
not
talk
over
their
heads
but
got
right
down
to
a
friendly
tone
such
as
we
use
in
ordinary
conversation
and
talked
at
them
appealing
to
their
honesty
and
common
sense
and
making
his
argument
plain
by
telling
a
story
or
two
that
brought
the
matter
clearly
within
their
understanding
when
he
did
not
know
the
law
in
a
particular
case
he
never
pretended
to
know
it
if
there
were
no
precedents
to
cover
a
case
he
would
state
his
side
plainly
and
fairly
he
would
tell
the
jury
what
he
believed
was
right
for
them
to
do
and
then
conclude
with
his
favorite
expression
it
seems
to
me
that
this
ought
to
be
the
law
some
time
before
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
a
lawyer
friend
said
to
him
lincoln
the
time
is
near
at
hand
when
we
shall
have
to
be
all
abolitionists
or
all
democrats
when
that
time
comes
my
mind
is
made
up
he
replied
for
i
believe
the
slavery
question
never
can
be
compromised
the
lion
is
aroused
to
action
while
lincoln
took
a
mild
interest
in
politics
he
was
not
a
candidate
for
office
except
as
a
presidential
elector
from
the
time
of
leaving
congress
until
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
this
repeal
legislation
was
the
work
of
lincolns
political
antagonist
stephen
a
douglas
and
aroused
mr
lincoln
to
action
as
the
lion
is
roused
by
some
foe
worthy
of
his
great
strength
and
courage
mr
douglas
argued
that
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
the
act
was
not
to
legislate
slavery
into
any
territory
or
state
nor
to
exclude
it
therefrom
but
to
leave
the
people
perfectly
free
to
form
and
regulate
their
domestic
institutions
in
their
own
way
douglas
argument
amounts
to
this
said
mr
lincoln
that
if
any
one
man
chooses
to
enslave
another
no
third
man
shall
be
allowed
to
object
after
the
adjournment
of
congress
mr
douglas
returned
to
illinois
and
began
to
defend
his
action
in
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
his
most
important
speech
was
made
at
springfield
and
mr
lincoln
was
selected
to
answer
it
that
speech
alone
was
sufficient
to
make
mr
lincoln
the
leader
of
antislavery
sentiment
in
the
west
and
some
of
the
men
who
heard
it
declared
that
it
was
the
greatest
speech
he
ever
made
with
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
the
whig
party
began
to
break
up
the
majority
of
its
members
who
were
pronounced
abolitionists
began
to
form
the
nucleus
of
the
republican
party
before
this
party
was
formed
however
mr
lincoln
was
induced
to
follow
douglas
around
the
state
and
reply
to
him
but
after
one
meeting
at
peoria
where
they
both
spoke
they
entered
into
an
agreement
to
return
to
their
homes
and
make
no
more
speeches
during
the
campaign
seeks
a
seat
in
the
senate
mr
lincoln
made
no
secret
at
this
time
of
his
ambition
to
represent
illinois
in
the
united
states
senate
against
his
protest
he
was
nominated
and
elected
to
the
legislature
but
resigned
his
seat
his
old
rival
james
shields
with
whom
he
was
once
near
to
a
duel
was
then
senator
and
his
term
was
to
expire
the
following
year
a
letter
written
by
mr
lincoln
to
a
friend
in
paris
illinois
at
this
time
is
interesting
and
significant
he
wrote
i
have
a
suspicion
that
a
whig
has
been
elected
to
the
legislature
from
eagar
if
this
is
not
so
why
then
nix
cum
arous
but
if
it
is
so
then
could
you
not
make
a
mark
with
him
for
me
for
united
states
senator
i
really
have
some
chance
another
candidate
besides
mr
lincoln
was
seeking
the
seat
in
the
united
states
senate
soon
to
be
vacated
by
mr
shields
this
was
lyman
trumbull
an
antislavery
democrat
when
the
legislature
met
it
was
found
that
mr
lincoln
lacked
five
votes
of
an
election
while
mr
trumbull
had
but
five
supporters
after
several
ballots
mr
lincoln
feared
that
trumbulls
votes
would
be
given
to
a
democratic
candidate
and
he
determined
to
sacrifice
himself
for
the
principle
at
stake
accordingly
he
instructed
his
friends
in
the
legislature
to
vote
for
judge
trumbull
which
they
did
resulting
in
trumbulls
election
the
abolitionists
in
the
west
had
become
very
radical
in
their
views
and
did
not
hesitate
to
talk
of
opposing
the
extension
of
slavery
by
the
use
of
force
if
necessary
mr
lincoln
on
the
other
hand
was
conservative
and
counseled
moderation
in
the
meantime
many
outrages
growing
out
of
the
extension
of
slavery
were
being
perpetrated
on
the
borders
of
kansas
and
missouri
and
they
no
doubt
influenced
mr
lincoln
to
take
a
more
radical
stand
against
the
slavery
question
an
incident
occurred
at
this
time
which
had
great
effect
in
this
direction
the
negro
son
of
a
colored
woman
in
springfield
had
gone
south
to
work
he
was
born
free
but
did
not
have
his
free
papers
with
him
he
was
arrested
and
would
have
been
sold
into
slavery
to
pay
his
prison
expenses
had
not
mr
lincoln
and
some
friends
purchased
his
liberty
previous
to
this
mr
lincoln
had
tried
to
secure
the
boys
release
through
the
governor
of
illinois
but
the
governor
informed
him
that
nothing
could
be
done
then
it
was
that
mr
lincoln
rose
to
his
full
height
and
exclaimed
governor
ill
make
the
ground
in
this
country
too
hot
for
the
foot
of
a
slave
whether
you
have
the
legal
power
to
secure
the
release
of
this
boy
or
not
helps
to
organize
the
republican
party
the
year
after
mr
trumbulls
election
to
the
senate
the
republican
party
was
formally
organized
a
state
convention
of
that
party
was
called
to
meet
at
bloomington
may
the
call
for
this
convention
was
signed
by
many
springfield
whigs
and
among
the
names
was
that
of
abraham
lincoln
mr
lincolns
name
had
been
signed
to
the
call
by
his
law
partner
but
when
he
was
informed
of
this
action
he
endorsed
it
fully
among
the
famous
men
who
took
part
in
this
convention
were
abraham
lincoln
lyman
trumbull
david
davis
leonard
swett
richard
yates
norman
b
judd
and
owen
lovejoy
the
alton
editor
whose
life
like
lincolns
finally
paid
the
penalty
for
his
abolition
views
the
party
nominated
for
governor
wm
h
bissell
a
veteran
of
the
mexican
war
and
adopted
a
platform
ringing
with
antislavery
sentiment
mr
lincoln
was
the
greatest
power
in
the
campaign
that
followed
he
was
one
of
the
fremont
presidential
electors
and
he
went
to
work
with
all
his
might
to
spread
the
new
party
gospel
and
make
votes
for
the
old
pathfinder
of
the
rocky
mountains
an
amusing
incident
followed
close
after
the
bloomington
convention
a
meeting
was
called
at
springfield
to
ratify
the
action
at
bloomington
only
three
persons
attendedmr
lincoln
his
law
partner
and
a
man
named
john
paine
mr
lincoln
made
a
speech
to
his
colleagues
in
which
among
other
things
he
said
while
all
seems
dead
the
age
itself
is
not
it
liveth
as
sure
as
our
maker
liveth
in
this
campaign
mr
lincoln
was
in
general
demand
not
only
in
his
own
state
but
in
indiana
iowa
and
wisconsin
as
well
the
result
of
that
presidential
campaign
was
the
election
of
buchanan
as
president
bissell
as
governor
leaving
mr
lincoln
the
undisputed
leader
of
the
new
party
hence
it
was
that
two
years
later
he
was
the
inevitable
man
to
oppose
judge
douglas
in
the
campaign
for
united
states
senator
the
rail
splitter
vs
the
little
giant
no
record
of
abraham
lincolns
career
would
be
complete
without
the
story
of
the
memorable
joint
debates
between
the
railsplitter
of
the
sangamon
valley
and
the
little
giant
the
opening
lines
in
mr
lincolns
speech
to
the
republican
convention
were
not
only
prophetic
of
the
coming
rebellion
but
they
clearly
made
the
issue
between
the
republican
and
democratic
parties
for
two
presidential
campaigns
to
follow
the
memorable
sentences
were
as
follows
a
house
divided
against
itself
cannot
stand
i
believe
this
government
cannot
endure
permanently
half
slave
and
half
free
i
do
not
expect
the
union
to
be
dissolved
i
do
not
expect
the
house
to
fall
but
i
do
expect
it
will
cease
to
be
divided
it
will
become
all
the
one
thing
or
the
other
either
the
opponents
of
slavery
will
arrest
the
further
spread
of
it
and
place
it
where
the
public
mind
shall
rest
in
the
belief
that
it
is
in
the
course
of
ultimate
extinction
or
its
advocates
will
push
it
forward
till
it
becomes
alike
lawful
in
all
the
states
old
as
well
as
new
north
as
well
as
south
it
is
universally
conceded
that
this
speech
contained
the
most
important
utterances
of
mr
lincolns
life
previous
to
its
delivery
the
democratic
convention
had
endorsed
mr
douglas
for
reelection
to
the
senate
and
the
republican
convention
had
resolved
that
abraham
lincoln
is
our
first
and
only
choice
for
united
states
senator
to
fill
the
vacancy
about
to
be
created
by
the
expiration
of
mr
douglas
term
of
office
before
judge
douglas
had
made
many
speeches
in
this
senatorial
campaign
mr
lincoln
challenged
him
to
a
joint
debate
which
was
accepted
and
seven
memorable
meetings
between
these
two
great
leaders
followed
the
places
and
dates
were
ottawa
august
st
freeport
august
th
jonesboro
september
th
charleston
september
th
galesburg
october
th
quincy
october
th
and
alton
october
th
the
debates
not
only
attracted
the
attention
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
illinois
but
aroused
an
interest
throughout
the
whole
country
equal
to
that
of
a
presidential
election
were
like
crowds
at
a
circus
all
the
meetings
of
the
joint
debate
were
attended
by
immense
crowds
of
people
they
came
in
all
sorts
of
vehicles
on
horseback
and
many
walked
weary
miles
on
foot
to
hear
these
two
great
leaders
discuss
the
issues
of
the
campaign
there
had
never
been
political
meetings
held
under
such
unusual
conditions
as
these
and
there
probably
never
will
be
again
at
every
place
the
speakers
were
met
by
great
crowds
of
their
friends
and
escorted
to
the
platforms
in
the
open
air
where
the
debates
were
held
the
processions
that
escorted
the
speakers
were
most
unique
they
carried
flags
and
banners
and
were
preceded
by
bands
of
music
the
people
discharged
cannons
when
they
had
them
and
when
they
did
not
blacksmiths
anvils
were
made
to
take
their
places
oftentimes
a
part
of
the
escort
would
be
mounted
and
in
most
of
the
processions
were
chariots
containing
young
ladies
representing
the
different
states
of
the
union
designated
by
banners
they
carried
besides
the
bands
there
was
usually
vocal
music
patriotic
songs
were
the
order
of
the
day
the
starspangled
banner
and
hail
columbia
being
great
favorites
so
far
as
the
crowds
were
concerned
these
joint
debates
took
on
the
appearance
of
a
circus
day
and
this
comparison
was
strengthened
by
the
sale
of
lemonade
fruit
melons
and
confectionery
on
the
outskirts
of
the
gatherings
at
ottawa
after
his
speech
mr
lincoln
was
carried
around
on
the
shoulders
of
his
enthusiastic
supporters
who
did
not
put
him
down
until
they
reached
the
place
where
he
was
to
spend
the
night
in
the
joint
debates
each
of
the
candidates
asked
the
other
a
series
of
questions
judge
douglas
replies
to
mr
lincolns
shrewd
questions
helped
douglas
to
win
the
senatorial
election
but
they
lost
him
the
support
of
the
south
in
the
campaign
for
president
two
years
thereafter
mr
lincoln
was
told
when
he
framed
his
questions
that
if
douglas
answered
them
in
the
way
it
was
believed
he
would
that
the
answers
would
make
him
senator
that
may
be
said
mr
lincoln
but
if
he
takes
that
shoot
he
never
can
be
president
the
prophecy
was
correct
mr
douglas
was
elected
senator
but
two
years
later
only
carried
one
statemissourifor
president
his
buckeye
campaign
after
the
close
of
this
canvass
mr
lincoln
again
devoted
himself
to
the
practice
of
his
profession
but
he
was
destined
to
remain
but
a
short
time
in
retirement
in
the
fall
of
mr
douglas
went
to
ohio
to
stump
the
state
for
his
friend
mr
pugh
the
democratic
candidate
for
governor
the
ohio
republicans
at
once
asked
mr
lincoln
to
come
to
the
state
and
reply
to
the
little
giant
he
accepted
the
invitation
and
made
two
masterly
speeches
in
the
campaign
in
one
of
them
delivered
at
cincinnati
he
prophesied
the
outcome
of
the
rebellion
if
the
southern
people
attempted
to
divide
the
union
by
force
addressing
himself
particularly
to
the
kentuckians
in
the
audience
he
said
i
have
told
you
what
we
mean
to
do
i
want
to
know
now
when
that
thing
takes
place
what
do
you
mean
to
do
i
often
hear
it
intimated
that
you
mean
to
divide
the
union
whenever
a
republican
or
anything
like
it
is
elected
president
of
the
united
states
a
voicethat
is
so
that
is
so
one
of
them
says
i
wonder
if
he
is
a
kentuckian
a
voicehe
is
a
douglas
man
well
then
i
want
to
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
your
half
of
it
are
you
going
to
split
the
ohio
down
through
and
push
your
half
off
a
piece
or
are
you
going
to
keep
it
right
alongside
of
us
outrageous
fellows
or
are
you
going
to
build
up
a
wall
some
way
between
your
country
and
ours
by
which
that
movable
property
of
yours
cant
come
over
here
any
more
to
the
danger
of
your
losing
it
do
you
think
you
can
better
yourselves
on
that
subject
by
leaving
us
here
under
no
obligation
whatever
to
return
those
specimens
of
your
movable
property
that
come
hither
you
have
divided
the
union
because
we
would
not
do
right
with
you
as
you
think
upon
that
subject
when
we
cease
to
be
under
obligations
to
do
anything
for
you
how
much
better
off
do
you
think
you
will
be
will
you
make
war
upon
us
and
kill
us
all
why
gentlemen
i
think
you
are
as
gallant
and
as
brave
men
as
live
that
you
can
fight
as
bravely
in
a
good
cause
man
for
man
as
any
other
people
living
that
you
have
shown
yourselves
capable
of
this
upon
various
occasions
but
man
for
man
you
are
not
better
than
we
are
and
there
are
not
so
many
of
you
as
there
are
of
us
you
will
never
make
much
of
a
hand
at
whipping
us
if
we
were
fewer
in
numbers
than
you
i
think
that
you
could
whip
us
if
we
were
equal
it
would
likely
be
a
drawn
battle
but
being
inferior
in
numbers
you
will
make
nothing
by
attempting
to
master
us
but
perhaps
i
have
addressed
myself
as
long
or
longer
to
the
kentuckians
than
i
ought
to
have
done
inasmuch
as
i
have
said
that
whatever
course
you
take
we
intend
in
the
end
to
beat
you
first
visit
to
new
york
later
in
the
year
mr

it
was
a
long
time
before
any
of
the
delegates
could
make
themselves
heard
cannons
planted
on
top
of
the
wigwam
were
roaring
and
booming
the
large
crowd
in
the
wigwam
and
the
immense
throng
outside
were
cheering
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
while
bands
were
playing
victorious
airs
when

restored
it
was
announced

heard
the
news
of
his
nomination
while
sitting
in
a
newspaper
office
in
springfield
and
hurried
home
to
tell
his
wife
as
mr

had
predicted
judge
douglas
position
on
slavery
in
the
territories
lost
him
the
support
of
the
south
and
when
the
democratic
convention
met
at
charleston
the
slaveholding
states
forced
the
nomination
of
john
c
breckinridge
a
considerable
number
of
people
who
did
not
agree
with
either
party
nominated
john
bell
of

in
the
election
which
followed
mr
lincoln
carried
all
of
the
free
states

was
divided
between
himself
and
douglas
breckinridge
carried
all
the
slave
states
except
kentucky
tennessee
and
virginia
which
went
for
bell
and
missouri
gave
its
vote
to
douglas
formation
of
the
southern
confederacy
the
election
was
scarcely
over
before
it
was
evident
that
the
southern
states
did
not
intend
to
abide
by
the
result
and
that
a
conspiracy
was
on
foot
to
divide
the
union
before
the
presidential
election
even
the
secretary
of
war
in
president
buchanans
cabinet
had
removed
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
muskets
from
government
armories
in
the
north
and
sent
them
to
government
armories
in
the
south
before
mr
lincoln
had
prepared
his
inaugural
address
south
carolina
which
took
the
lead
in
the
secession
movement
had
declared
through
her
legislature
her
separation
from
the
union
before
mr
lincoln
took
his
seat
other
southern
states
had
followed
the
example
of
south
carolina
and
a
convention
had
been
held
at
montgomery
alabama
which
had
elected
jefferson
davis
president
of
the
new
confederacy
and
alexander
h
stevens
of
georgia
vicepresident
southern
men
in
the
cabinet
senate
and
house
had
resigned
their
seats
and
gone
home
and
southern
states
were
demanding
that
southern
forts
and
government
property
in
their
section
should
be
turned
over
to
them
between
his
election
and
inauguration
mr
lincoln
remained
silent
reserving
his
opinions
and
a
declaration
of
his
policy
for
his
inaugural
address
before
mr
lincolns
departure
from
springfield
for
washington
threats
had
been
freely
made
that
he
would
never
reach
the
capital
alive
and
in
fact
a
conspiracy
was
then
on
foot
to
take
his
life
in
the
city
of
baltimore
mr

goodbye
to
the
old
folk
early
in
february
before
leaving
for
washington
mr
lincoln
slipped
away
from
springfield
and
paid
a
visit
to
his
aged
stepmother
in
coles
county
he
also
paid
a
visit
to
the
unmarked
grave
of
his
father
and
ordered
a
suitable
stone
to
mark
the
spot
before
leaving
springfield
he
made
an
address
to
his
fellowtownsmen
in
which
he
displayed
sincere
sorrow
at
parting
from
them
friends
he
said
no
one
who
has
never
been
placed
in
a
like
position
can
understand
my
feelings
at
this
hour
nor
the
oppressive
sadness
i
feel
at
this
parting
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
have
lived
among
you
and
during
all
that
time
i
have
received
nothing
but
kindness
at
your
hands
here
i
have
lived
from
my
youth
until
now
i
am
an
old
man
here
the
most
sacred
ties
of
earth
were
assumed
here
all
my
children
were
born
and
here
one
of
them
lies
buried
to
you
dear
friends
i
owe
all
that
i
have
all
that
i
am
all
the
strange
checkered
past
seems
to
crowd
now
upon
my
mind
today
i
leave
you
i
go
to
assume
a
task
more
difficult
than
that
which
devolved
upon
washington
unless
the
great
god
who
assisted
him
shall
be
with
and
aid
me
i
must
fail
but
if
the
same
omniscient
mind
and
almighty
arm
that
directed
and
protected
him
shall
guide
and
support
me
i
shall
not
faili
shall
succeed
let
us
all
pray
that
the
god
of
our
fathers
may
not
forsake
us
now
to
him
i
commend
you
all
permit
me
to
ask
that
with
equal
sincerity
and
faith
you
will
invoke
his
wisdom
and
guidance
for
me
with
these
words
i
must
leave
you
for
how
long
i
know
not
friends
one
and
all
i
must
now
bid
you
an
affectionate
farewell
the
journey
from
springfield
to
philadelphia
was
a
continuous
ovation
for
mr
lincoln
crowds
assembled
to
meet
him
at
the
various
places
along
the
way
and
he
made
them
short
speeches
full
of
humor
and
good
feeling
at
harrisburg
pa
the
party
was
met
by
allan
pinkerton
who
knew
of
the
plot
in
baltimore
to
take
the
life
of
mr
lincoln
the
secret
passage
to
washington
throughout
his
entire
life
abraham
lincolns
physical
courage
was
as
great
and
superb
as
his
moral
courage
when
mr
pinkerton
and
mr
judd
urged
the
presidentelect
to
leave
for
washington
that
night
he
positively
refused
to
do
it
he
said
he
had
made
an
engagement
to
assist
at
a
flag
raising
in
the
forenoon
of
the
next
day
and
to
show
himself
to
the
people
of
harrisburg
in
the
afternoon
and
that
he
intended
to
keep
both
engagements
at
philadelphia
the
presidential
party
was
met
by
mr
sewards
son
frederick
who
had
been
sent
to
warn
mr
lincoln
of
the
plot
against
his
life
mr
judd
mr
pinkerton
and
mr
lamon
figured
out
a
plan
to
take
mr
lincoln
through
baltimore
between
midnight
and
daybreak
when
the
wouldbe
assassins
would
not
be
expecting
him
and
this
plan
was
carried
out
so
thoroughly
that
even
the
conductor
on
the
train
did
not
know
the
presidentelect
was
on
board
mr
lincoln
was
put
into
his
berth
and
the
curtains
drawn
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
sick
man
when
the
conductor
came
around
mr
pinkerton
handed
him
the
sick
mans
ticket
and
he
passed
on
without
question
when
the
train
reached
baltimore
at
halfpast
three
oclock
in
the
morning
it
was
met
by
one
of
mr
pinkertons
detectives
who
reported
that
everything
was
all
right
and
in
a
short
time
the
party
was
speeding
on
to
the
national
capital
where
rooms
had
been
engaged
for
mr
lincoln
and
his
guard
at
willards
hotel
mr
lincoln
always
regretted
this
secret
passage
to
washington
for
it
was
repugnant
to
a
man
of
his
high
courage
he
had
agreed
to
the
plan
simply
because
all
of
his
friends
urged
it
as
the
best
thing
to
do
now
that
all
the
facts
are
known
it
is
assured
that
his
friends
were
right
and
that
there
never
was
a
moment
from
the
day
he
crossed
the
maryland
line
until
his
assassination
that
his
life
was
not
in
danger
and
was
only
saved
as
long
as
it
was
by
the
constant
vigilance
of
those
who
were
guarding
him

eloquent
inaugural
address

expression
in
his
first
inaugural
address
in
which
he
not
only
outlined
his
policy
toward
the
states
in
rebellion
but
made
that
beautiful
and
eloquent
plea
for
conciliation
the
closing
sentences
of
mr
lincolns
first
inaugural
address
deservedly
take
rank
with
his
gettysburg
speech
in

my

said

will
not
assail
you
you
can
have
no

without
being
yourselves

aggressors
you
have
no

to
destroy

i
shall
have
the
most
solemn
one
to
preserve

i
am
loath
to
close
we
are
not
enemies
but
friends
we
must
not

may

of
memory
stretching
from
every
battlefield
and
patriot
grave
to
every
living
heart
and

all
over
this
broad
land
will
yet
swell

of

mr
lincoln
consciously
or
unconsciously
followed
a
precedent
established
by
washington
of
selecting
men
of
almost
opposite
opinions

of

while
mr

was

without
having
connected
himself
with
the
antislavery
movement
mr
chase
and
mr
seward
the
leading
men
of
mr
lincolns
cabinet
were
as
widely
apart
and
antagonistic
in
their
views
as
were
jefferson
the
democrat
and
hamilton
the
federalist
the
two
leaders
in
washingtons
cabinet
but
in
bringing
together
these
two
strong
men
as
his
chief
advisers
both
of
whom
had
been
rival
candidates
for
the
presidency
mr
lincoln
gave
another
example
of
his
own
greatness
and
selfreliance
and
put
them
both
in
a
position
to
render
greater
service
to
the
government
than
they
could
have
done
probably
as
president
mr
lincoln
had
been
in
office
little
more
than
five
weeks
when

sides

character
it
showed
him
as
a
real
ruler

ruler
by
the

power

but
by
the
power
of
a
great
brain
in
his
cabinet
were
the
ablest
men
in
the
country
yet
they
all
knew
that
lincoln
was
abler
than
any
of
them
mr
seward
the
secretary
of
state
was
a
man
famed
in
statesmanship
and
diplomacy
during
the
early
stages
of
the
civil
war
when
france
and
england
were
seeking
an
excuse
to
interfere
and
help
the
southern
confederacy
mr
seward
wrote
a
letter
to
our
minister
in
london
charles
francis
adams
instructing
him
concerning
the
attitude
of
the
federal
government
on
the
question
of
interference
which
would
undoubtedly
have
brought
about
a
war
with
england
if
abraham
lincoln
had
not
corrected
and
amended
the
letter
he
did
this
too
without
yielding
a
point
or
sacrificing
in
any
way
his
own
dignity
or
that
of
the
country
lincoln
a
great
general
throughout
the
four
years
of
war
mr
lincoln
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
the
war
department
receiving
news
from
the
front
and
conferring
with
secretary
of
war
stanton
concerning
military
affairs
mr
lincolns
war
secretary
edwin
m
stanton
who
had
succeeded
simon
cameron
was
a
man
of
wonderful
personality
and
iron
will
it
is
generally
conceded
that
no
other
man
could
have
managed
the
great
war
secretary
so
well
as
lincoln
stanton
had
his
way
in
most
matters
but
when
there
was
an
important
difference
of
opinion
he
always
found
lincoln
was
the
master
although
mr
lincolns
communications
to
the
generals
in
the
field
were
oftener
in
the
nature
of
suggestions
than
positive
orders
every
military
leader
recognized
mr
lincolns
ability
in
military
operations
in
the
early
stages
of
the
war
mr
lincoln
followed
closely
every
plan
and
movement
of
mcclellan
and
the
correspondence
between
them
proves
mr
lincoln
to
have
been
far
the
abler
general
of
the
two
he
kept
close
watch
of
burnside
too
and
when
he
gave
the
command
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
to
fighting
joe
hooker
he
also
gave
that
general
some
fatherly
counsel
and
advice
which
was
of
great
benefit
to
him
as
a
commander
absolute
confidence
in
grant
it
was
not
until
general
grant
had
been
made
commanderinchief
that
president
lincoln
felt
he
had
at
last
found
a
general
who
did
not
need
much
advice
he
was
the
first
to
recognize
that
grant
was
a
great
military
leader
and
when
he
once
felt
sure
of
this
fact
nothing
could
shake
his
confidence
in
that
general
delegation
after
delegation
called
at
the
white
house
and
asked
for
grants
removal
from
the
head
of
the
army
they
accused
him
of
being
a
butcher
a
drunkard
a
man
without
sense
or
feeling
president
lincoln
listened
to
all
of
these
attacks
but
he
always
had
an
apt
answer
to
silence
grants
enemies
grant
was
doing
what
lincoln
wanted
done
from
the
firsthe
was
fighting
and
winning
victories
and
victories
are
the
only
things
that
count
in
war
reasons
fob
freeing
the
slaves
the
crowning
act
of
lincolns
career
as
president
was
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
all
of
his
life
he
had
believed
in
gradual
emancipation
but
all
of
his
plans
contemplated
payment
to
the
slaveholders
while
he
had
always
been
opposed
to
slavery
he
did
not
take
any
steps
to
use
it
as
a
war
measure
until
about
the
middle
of
his
chief
object
was
to
preserve
the
union
he
wrote
to
horace
greeley
that
if
he
could
save
the
union
without
freeing
any
of
the
slaves
he
would
do
it
that
if
he
could
save
it
by
freeing
some
and
leaving
the
others
in
slavery
he
would
do
that
that
if
it
became
necessary
to
free
all
the
slaves
in
order
to
save
the
union
he
would
take
that
course
the
antislavery
men
were
continually
urging
mr
lincoln
to
set
the
slaves
free
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
their
petitions
and
demands
until
he
felt
that
emancipation
would
help
him
to
preserve
the
union
of
the
states
the
outlook
for
the
union
cause
grew
darker
and
darker
in
and
mr
lincoln
began
to
think
as
he
expressed
it
that
he
must
change
his
tactics
or
lose
the
game
accordingly
he
decided
to
issue
the
emancipation
proclamation
as
soon
as
the
union
army
won
a
substantial
victory
the
battle
of
antietam
on
september
gave
him
the
opportunity
he
sought
he
told
secretary
chase
that
he
had
made
a
solemn
vow
before
god
that
if
general
lee
should
be
driven
back
from
pennsylvania
he
would
crown
the
result
by
a
declaration
of
freedom
to
the
slaves
on
the
twentysecond
of
that
month
he
issued
a
proclamation
stating
that
at
the
end
of
one
hundred
days
he
would
issue
another
proclamation
declaring
all
slaves
within
any
state
or
territory
to
be
forever
free
which
was
done
in
the
form
of
the
famous
emancipation
proclamation
hard
to
refuse
pardons
in
the
conduct
of
the
war
and
in
his
purpose
to
maintain
the
union
abraham
lincoln
exhibited
a
will
of
iron
and
determination
that
could
not
be
shaken
but
in
his
daily
contact
with
the
mothers
wives
and
daughters
begging
for
the
life
of
some
soldier
who
had
been
condemned
to
death
for
desertion
or
sleeping
on
duty
he
was
as
gentle
and
weak
as
a
woman
it
was
a
difficult
matter
for
him
to
refuse
a
pardon
if
the
slightest
excuse
could
be
found
for
granting
it
secretary
stanton
and
the
commanding
generals
were
loud
in
declaring
that
mr
lincoln
would
destroy
the
discipline
of
the
army
by
his
wholesale
pardoning
of
condemned
soldiers
but
when
we
come
to
examine
the
individual
cases
we
find
that
lincoln
was
nearly
always
right
and
when
he
erred
it
was
always
on
the
side
of
humanity
during
the
four
years
of
the
long
struggle
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
mr
lincoln
kept
open
shop
as
he
expressed
it
where
the
general
public
could
always
see
him
and
make
known
their
wants
and
complaints
even
the
private
soldier
was
not
denied
admittance
to
the
presidents
private
office
and
no
request
or
complaint
was
too
small
or
trivial
to
enlist
his
sympathy
and
interest
a
funloving
and
humorloving
man
it
was
once
said
of
shakespeare
that
the
great
mind
that
conceived
the
tragedies
of
hamlet
macbeth
etc
would
have
lost
its
reason
if
it
had
not
found
vent
in
the
sparkling
humor
of
such
comedies
as
the
merry
wives
of
windsor
and
the
comedy
of
errors
the
great
strain
on
the
mind
of
abraham
lincoln
produced
by
four
years
of
civil
war
might
likewise
have
overcome
his
reason
had
it
not
found
vent
in
the
yarns
and
stories
he
constantly
told
no
more
funloving
or
humorloving
man
than
abraham
lincoln
ever
lived
he
enjoyed
a
joke
even
when
it
was
on
himself
and
probably
while
he
got
his
greatest
enjoyment
from
telling
stories
he
had
a
keen
appreciation
of
the
humor
in
those
that
were
told
him
his
favorite
humorous
writer
was
david
r
locke
better
known
as
petroleum
v
nasby
whose
political
satires
were
quite
famous
in
their
day
nearly
every
prominent
man
who
has
written
his
recollections
of
lincoln
has
told
how
the
president
in
the
middle
of
a
conversation
on
some
serious
subject
would
suddenly
stop
and
ask
his
hearer
if
he
ever
read
the
nasby
letters
then
he
would
take
from
his
desk
a
pamphlet
containing
the
letters
and
proceed
to
read
them
laughing
heartily
at
all
the
good
points
they
contained
there
is
probably
no
better
evidence
of
mr
lincolns
love
of
humor
and
appreciation
of
it
than
his
letter
to
nasby
in
which
he
said
for
the
ability
to
write
these
things
i
would
gladly
trade
places
with
you
mr
lincoln
was
reelected
president
in
his
opponent
on
the
democratic
ticket
was
general
george
b
mcclellan
whose
command
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
had
been
so
unsatisfactory
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
mr
lincolns
election
was
almost
unanimous
as
mcclellan
carried
but
three
statesdelaware
kentucky
and
new
jersey
general
grant
in
a
telegram
of
congratulation
said
that
it
was
a
victory
worth
more
to
the
country
than
a
battle
won
the
war
was
fast
drawing
to
a
close
the
black
war
clouds
were
breaking
and
rolling
away
sherman
had
made
his
famous
march
to
the
sea
through
swamp
and
ravine
grant
was
rapidly
tightening
the
lines
around
richmond
thomas
had
won
his
title
of
the
rock
of
chickamauga
sheridan
had
won
his
spurs
as
the
great
modern
cavalry
commander
and
had
cleaned
out
the
shenandoah
valley
sherman
was
coming
back
from
his
famous
march
to
join
grant
at
richmond
the
confederacy
was
without
a
navy
the
kearsarge
had
sunk
the
alabama
and
farragut
had
fought
and
won
the
famous
victory
in
mobile
bay
it
was
certain
that
lee
would
soon
have
to
evacuate
richmond
only
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
grant
lincoln
saw
the
dawn
of
peace
when
he
came
to
deliver
his
second
inaugural
address
it
contained
no
note
of
victory
no
exultation
over
a
fallen
foe
on
the
contrary
it
breathed
the
spirit
of
brotherly
love
and
of
prayer
for
an
early
peace
with
malice
toward
none
with
charity
for
all
with
firmness
in
the
right
as
god
gives
us
to
see
the
right
let
us
finish
the
work
we
are
in
to
bind
up
the
nations
wounds
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle
and
for
his
widow
and
his
orphans
to
do
all
which
may
achieve
and
cherish
a
just
and
lasting
peace
among
ourselves
and
with
all
nations
not
long
thereafter
general
lee
evacuated
richmond
with
about
half
of
his
original
army
closely
pursued
by
grant
the
boys
in
blue
overtook
their
brothers
in
gray
at
appomattox
court
house
and
there
beneath
the
warm
rays
of
an
april
sun
the
great
confederate
general
made
his
final
surrender
the
war
was
over
the
american
flag
was
floated
over
all
the
territory
of
the
united
states
and
peace
was
now
a
reality
mr
lincoln
visited
richmond
and
the
final
scenes
of
the
war
and
then
returned
to
washington
to
carry
out
his
announced
plan
of
binding
up
the
nations
wounds
he
had
now
reached
the
climax
of
his
career
and
touched
the
highest
point
of
his
greatness
his
great
task
was
over
and
the
heavy
burden
that
had
so
long
worn
upon
his
heart
was
lifted
while
the
whole
nation
was
rejoicing
over
the
return
of
peace
the
saviour
of
the
union
was
stricken
down
by
the
hand
of
an
assassin
warnings
of
his
tragic
death
from
early
youth
mr
lincoln
had
presentiments
that
he
would
die
a
violent
death
or
rather
that
his
final
days
would
be
marked
by
some
great
tragic
event
from
the
time
of
his
first
election
to
the
presidency
his
closest
friends
had
tried
to
make
him
understand
that
he
was
in
constant
danger
of
assassination
but
notwithstanding
his
presentiments
he
had
such
splendid
courage
that
he
only
laughed
at
their
fears
during
the
summer
months
he
lived
at
the
soldiers
home
some
miles
from
washington
and
frequently
made
the
trip
between
the
white
house
and
the
home
without
a
guard
or
escort
secretary
of
war
stanton
and
ward
lamon
marshal
of
the
district
were
almost
constantly
alarmed
over
mr
lincolns
carelessness
in
exposing
himself
to
the
danger
of
assassination
they
warned
him
time
and
again
and
provided
suitable
bodyguards
to
attend
him
but
mr
lincoln
would
often
give
the
guards
the
slip
and
mounting
his
favorite
riding
horse
old
abe
would
set
out
alone
after
dark
from
the
white
house
for
the
soldiers
home
while
riding
to
the
home
one
night
he
was
fired
upon
by
some
one
in
ambush
the
bullet
passing
through
his
high
hat
mr
lincoln
would
not
admit
that
the
man
who
fired
the
shot
had
tried
to
kill
him
he
always
attributed
it
to
an
accident
and
begged
his
friends
to
say
nothing
about
it
now
that
all
the
circumstances
of
the
assassination
are
known
it
is
plain
that
there
was
a
deeplaid
and
wellconceived
plot
to
kill
mr
lincoln
long
before
the
crime
was
actually
committed
when
mr
lincoln
was
delivering
his
second
inaugural
address
on
the
steps
of
the
capitol
an
excited
individual
tried
to
force
his
way
through
the
guards
in
the
building
to
get
on
the
platform
with
mr
lincoln
it
was
afterward
learned
that
this
man
was
john
wilkes
booth
who
afterwards
assassinated
mr
lincoln
in
fords
theatre
on
the
night
of
the
th
of
april
lincoln
at
the
theatre
the
manager
of
the
theatre
had
invited
the
president
to
witness
a
performance
of
a
new
play
known
as
our
american
cousin
in
which
the
famous
actress
laura
keane
was
playing
mr
lincoln
was
particularly
fond
of
the
theatre
he
loved
shakespeares
plays
above
all
others
and
never
missed
a
chance
to
see
the
leading
shakespearean
actors
as
our
american
cousin
was
a
new
play
the
president
did
not
care
particularly
to
see
it
but
as
mrs
lincoln
was
anxious
to
go
he
consented
and
accepted
the
invitation
general
grant
was
in
washington
at
the
time
and
as
he
was
extremely
anxious
about
the
personal
safety
of
the
president
he
reported
every
day
regularly
at
the
white
house
mr
lincoln
invited
general
grant
and
his
wife
to
accompany
him
and
mrs
lincoln
to
the
theatre
on
the
night
of
the
assassination
and
the
general
accepted
but
while
they
were
talking
he
received
a
note
from
mrs
grant
saying
that
she
wished
to
leave
washington
that
evening
to
visit
her
daughter
in
burlington
general
grant
made
his
excuses
to
the
president
and
left
to
accompany
mrs
grant
to
the
railway
station
it
afterwards
became
known
that
it
was
also
a
part
of
the
plot
to
assassinate
general
grant
and
only
mrs
grants
departure
from
washington
that
evening
prevented
the
attempt
from
being
made
general
grant
afterwards
said
that
as
he
and
mrs
grant
were
riding
along
pennsylvania
avenue
to
the
railway
station
a
horseman
rode
rapidly
by
at
a
gallop
and
wheeling
his
horse
rode
back
peering
into
their
carriage
as
he
passed
mrs
grant
remarked
to
the
general
that
is
the
very
man
who
sat
near
us
at
luncheon
today
and
tried
to
overhear
our
conversation
he
was
so
rude
you
remember
as
to
cause
us
to
leave
the
diningroom
here
he
is
again
riding
after
us
general
grant
attributed
the
action
of
the
man
to
idle
curiosity
but
learned
afterward
that
the
horseman
was
john
wilkes
booth
lamons
remarkable
request
probably
one
reason
why
mr
lincoln
did
not
particularly
care
to
go
to
the
theatre
that
night
was
a
sort
of
half
promise
he
had
made
to
his
friend
and
bodyguard
marshal
lamon
two
days
previous
he
had
sent
lamon
to
richmond
on
business
connected
with
a
call
of
a
convention
for
reconstruction
before
leaving
mr
lamon
saw
mr
usher
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
asked
him
to
persuade
mr
lincoln
to
use
more
caution
about
his
personal
safety
and
to
go
out
as
little
as
possible
while
lamon
was
absent
together
they
went
to
see
mr
lincoln
and
lamon
asked
the
president
if
he
would
make
him
a
promise
i
think
i
can
venture
to
say
i
will
said
mr
lincoln
what
is
it
promise
me
that
you
will
not
go
out
after
night
while
i
am
gone
said
mr
lamon
particularly
to
the
theatre
mr
lincoln
turned
to
mr
usher
and
said
usher
this
boy
is
a
monomaniac
on
the
subject
of
my
safety
i
can
hear
him
or
hear
of
his
being
around
at
all
times
in
the
night
to
prevent
somebody
from
murdering
me
he
thinks
i
shall
be
killed
and
we
think
he
is
going
crazy
what
does
any
one
want
to
assassinate
me
for
if
any
one
wants
to
do
so
he
can
do
it
any
day
or
night
if
he
is
ready
to
give
his
life
for
mine
it
is
nonsense
mr
usher
said
to
mr
lincoln
that
it
was
well
to
heed
lamons
warning
as
he
was
thrown
among
people
from
whom
he
had
better
opportunities
to
know
about
such
matters
than
almost
any
one
well
said
mr
lincoln
to
lamon
i
promise
to
do
the
best
i
can
toward
it
how
lincoln
was
murdered
the
assassination
of
president
lincoln
was
most
carefully
planned
even
to
the
smallest
detail
the
box
set
apart
for
the
presidents
party
was
a
double
one
in
the
second
tier
at
the
left
of
the
stage
the
box
had
two
doors
with
spring
locks
but
booth
had
loosened
the
screws
with
which
they
were
fastened
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
secure
them
from
the
inside
in
one
door
he
had
bored
a
hole
with
a
gimlet
so
that
he
could
see
what
was
going
on
inside
the
box
an
employee
of
the
theatre
by
the
name
of
spangler
who
was
an
accomplice
of
the
assassin
had
even
arranged
the
seats
in
the
box
to
suit
the
purposes
of
booth
on
the
fateful
night
the
theatre
was
packed
the
presidential
party
arrived
a
few
minutes
after
nine
oclock
and
consisted
of
the
president
and
mrs
lincoln
miss
harris
and
major
rathbone
daughter
and
stepson
of
senator
harris
of
new
york
the
immense
audience
rose
to
its
feet
and
cheered
the
president
as
he
passed
to
his
box
booth
came
into
the
theatre
about
ten
oclock
he
had
not
only
planned
to
kill
the
president
but
he
had
also
planned
to
escape
into
maryland
and
a
swift
horse
saddled
and
ready
for
the
journey
was
tied
in
the
rear
of
the
theatre
for
a
few
minutes
he
pretended
to
be
interested
in
the
performance
and
then
gradually
made
his
way
back
to
the
door
of
the
presidents
box
before
reaching
there
however
he
was
confronted
by
one
of
the
presidents
messengers
who
had
been
stationed
at
the
end
of
the
passage
leading
to
the
boxes
to
prevent
any
one
from
intruding
to
this
man
booth
handed
a
card
saying
that
the
president
had
sent
for
him
and
was
permitted
to
enter
once
inside
the
hallway
leading
to
the
boxes
he
closed
the
hall
door
and
fastened
it
by
a
bar
prepared
for
the
occasion
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
open
it
from
without
then
he
quickly
entered
the
box
through
the
righthand
door
the
president
was
sitting
in
an
easy
armchair
in
the
lefthand
corner
of
the
box
nearest
the
audience
he
was
leaning
on
one
hand
and
with
the
other
had
hold
of
a
portion
of
the
drapery
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
the
other
members
of
the
party
were
intently
watching
the
performance
on
the
stage
the
assassin
carried
in
his
right
hand
a
small
silvermounted
derringer
pistol
and
in
his
left
a
long
doubleedged
dagger
he
placed
the
pistol
just
behind
the
presidents
left
ear
and
fired
mr
lincoln
bent
slightly
forward
and
his
eyes
closed
but
in
every
other
respect
his
attitude
remained
unchanged
the
report
of
the
pistol
startled
major
rathbone
who
sprang
to
his
feet
the
murderer
was
then
about
six
feet
from
the
president
and
rathbone
grappled
with
him
but
was
shaken
off
dropping
his
pistol
booth
struck
at
rathbone
with
the
dagger
and
inflicted
a
severe
wound
the
assassin
then
placed
his
left
hand
lightly
on
the
railing
of
the
box
and
jumped
to
the
stage
eight
or
nine
feet
below
booth
brandishes
his
dagger
and
escapes
the
box
was
draped
with
the
american
flag
and
in
jumping
booths
spurs
caught
in
the
folds
tearing
down
the
flag
the
assassin
falling
heavily
to
the
stage
and
spraining
his
ankle
he
arose
however
and
walked
theatrically
across
the
stage
brandished
his
knife
and
shouted
sic
semper
tyrannis
and
then
added
the
south
is
avenged
for
the
moment
the
audience
was
horrified
and
incapable
of
action
one
man
only
a
lawyer
named
stuart
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
leap
upon
the
stage
and
attempt
to
capture
the
assassin
booth
went
to
the
rear
door
of
the
stage
where
his
horse
was
held
in
readiness
for
him
and
leaping
into
the
saddle
dashed
through
the
streets
toward
virginia
miss
keane
rushed
to
the

with
water
and
stimulants
and
medical
aid
was
summoned
by
this
time
the
audience
realized
the
tragedy
that
had
been
enacted
and
then
followed
a
scene
such
as
has
never
been
witnessed
in
any
public
gathering
in
this
country
women
wept
shrieked
and
fainted
men
raved
and
swore
and
horror
was
depicted
on
every
face
before
the
audience
could
be
gotten
out
of
the
theatre
horsemen
were
dashing
through
the
streets
and
the

was
carrying
the
terrible

the

has
sketched
in
graphic
language
the
scenes
of
that
most
eventful
fourteenth
of
april
his
account
of
the
assassination
has
become
historic
and
is
herewith

the
day
april
seems
to
have
been
a
pleasant
one
throughout
the
whole
landthe
moral
atmosphere
pleasant
toothe
long
storm
so
dark
so
fratricidal
full
of
blood
and
doubt
and
gloom
over
and
ended
at
last
by
the
sunrise
of
such
an
absolute
national
victory
and
utter
breaking
down
of
secessionismwe
almost
doubted
our
senses
lee
had
capitulated
beneath
the
apple
tree
at
appomattox
the
other
armies
the
flanges
of
the
revolt
swiftly
followed
and
could
it
really
be
then
out
of
all
the
affairs
of
this
world
of
woe
and
passion
of
failure
and
disorder
and
dismay
was
there
really
come
the
confirmed
unerring
sign
of
peace
like
a
shaft
of
pure
lightof
rightful
ruleof
god
but
i
must
not
dwell
on
accessories
the
deed
hastens
the
popular
afternoon
paper
the
little
evening
star
had
scattered
all
over
its
third
page
divided
among
the
advertisements
in
a
sensational
manner
in
a
hundred
different
places
the
president
and
his
lady
will
be
at
the
theatre
this
evening
lincoln
was
fond
of
the
theatre
i
have
myself
seen
him
there
several
times
i
remember
thinking
how
funny
it
was
that
he
the
leading
actor
in
the
greatest
and
stormiest
drama
known
to
real
historys
stage
through
centuries
should
sit
there
and
be
so
completely
interested
in
those
human
jackstraws
moving
about
with
their
silly
little
gestures
foreign
spirit
and
flatulent
text
so
the
day
as
i
say
was
propitious
early
herbage
early
flowers
were
out
i
remember
where
i
was
stopping
at
the
time
the
season
being
advanced
there
were
many
lilacs
in
full
bloom
by
one
of
those
caprices
that
enter
and
give
tinge
to
events
without
being
a
part
of
them
i
find
myself
always
reminded
of
the
great
tragedy
of
this
day
by
the
sight
and
odor
of
these
blossoms
it
never
fails
on
this
occasion
the
theatre
was
crowded
many
ladies
in
rich
and
gay
costumes
officers
in
their
uniforms
many
wellknown
citizens
young
folks
the
usual
cluster
of
gas
lights
the
usual
magnetism
of
so
many
people
cheerful
with
perfumes
music
of
violins
and
flutesand
over
all
that
saturating
that
vast
vague
wonder
victory
the
nations
victory
the
triumph
of
the
union
filling
the
air
the
thought
the
sense
with
exhilaration
more
than
all
the
perfumes
the
president
came
betimes
and
with
his
wife
witnessed
the
play
from
the
large
stage
boxes
of
the
second
tier
two
thrown
into
one
and
profusely
draped
with
the
national
flag
the
acts
and
scenes
of
the
pieceone
of
those
singularly
witless
compositions
which
have
at
the
least
the
merit
of
giving
entire
relief
to
an
audience
engaged
in
mental
action
or
business
excitements
and
cares
during
the
day
as
it
makes
not
the
slightest
call
on
either
the
moral
emotional
esthetic
or
spiritual
naturea
piece
in
which
among
other
characters
so
called
a
yankeecertainly
such
a
one
as
was
never
seen
or
at
least
like
it
ever
seen
in
north
america
is
introduced
in
england
with
a
varied
folderol
of
talk
plot
scenery
and
such
phantasmagoria
as
goes
to
make
up
a
modern
popular
dramahad
progressed
perhaps
through
a
couple
of
its
acts
when
in
the
midst
of
this
comedy
or
tragedy
or
nonsuch
or
whatever
it
is
to
be
called
and
to
offset
it
or
finish
it
out
as
if
in
natures
and
the
great
muses
mockery
of
these
poor
mimics
comes
interpolated
that
scene
not
really
or
exactly
to
be
described
at
all
for
on
the
many
hundreds
who
were
there
it
seems
to
this
hour
to
have
left
little
but
a
passing
blur
a
dream
a
blotchand
yet
partially
described
as
i
now
proceed
to
give
it
there
is
a
scene
in
the
play
representing
the
modern
parlor
in
which
two
unprecedented
ladies
are
informed
by
the
unprecedented
and
impossible
yankee
that
he
is
not
a
man
of
fortune
and
therefore
undesirable
for
marriagecatching
purposes
after
which
the
comments
being
finished
the
dramatic
trio
make
exit
leaving
the
stage
clear
for
a
moment
there
was
a
pause
a
hush
as
it
were
at
this
period
came
the
death
of
abraham
lincoln
great
as
that
was
with
all
its
manifold
train
circling
around
it
and
stretching
into
the
future
for
many
a
century
in
the
politics

of
the
new

growth
of

for

through
the
general
hum
following

with
the
change
of

came
the
muffled
sound
of
a

shot
which
not

at

then
through

a

clear

such
a
wild
scene
or
a

it
rather
inside
the

that
night
outside

atmosphere

shock

crowds
of
people
filled
with
frenzy
ready
to

several
times
on
innocent
individuals
one
such

was
particularly
exciting
the
infuriated
crowd
through
some
chance
got
started
against
one
man
either
for
words
he
uttered
or
perhaps
without

cause
at
all
and
were
proceeding
to
hang
him
at
once
to
a
neighboring
lamppost
when
he
was
rescued
by
a
few
heroic
policemen
who
placed
him
in
their
midst
and
fought
their
way
slowly
and
amid
great
peril
toward
the
stationhouse
it
was
a
fitting
episode
of
the
whole
affair
the
crowd
rushing
and
eddying
to
and
fro
the
night
the
yells
the
pale
faces
many
frightened
people
trying
in
vain
to
extricate
themselves
the
attacked
man
not

freed
from
the
jaws
of

looking
like

the
silent
resolute
halfdozen
policemen
with
no
weapons
but
their
little
clubs

stern
and
steady
through
all
those
eddying
swarms
made
indeed
a
fitting
side
scene
to
the
grand
tragedy
of
the
murder
they
gained
the
stationhouse
with
the
protected
man
whom
they
placed
in
security
for
the
night

edwin

found
in
a
barn
booth
accompanied
by
david
c
herold
a
fellowconspirator
finally
made
his
way
into
maryland
where
eleven
days
after
the
assassination
the
two
were
discovered
in
a
barn
on
garretts
farm
near
port
royal
on
the
rappahannock
the
barn
was
surrounded
by
a
squad
of
cavalrymen
who
called
upon
the
assassins
to
surrender
herold
gave
himself
up
and
was
roundly
cursed
and
abused
by
booth
who
declared
that
he
would
never
be
taken
alive
the
cavalrymen
then
set
fire
to
the
barn
and
as
the
flames
leaped
up
the
figure
of
the
assassin
could
be
plainly
seen
although
the
wall
of
fire
prevented
him
from
seeing
the
soldiers
colonel
conger
saw
him
standing
upright
upon
a
crutch
with
a
carbine
in
his
hands
when
the
fire
first
blazed
up
booth
crept
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
the
spot
evidently
for
the
purpose
of
shooting
the
man
who
had
applied
the
torch
but
the
blaze
prevented
him
from
seeing
anyone
then
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
preparing
to
extinguish
the
flames
but
seeing
the
impossibility
of
this
he
started
toward
the
door
with
his
carbine
held
ready
for
action
his
eyes
shone
with
the
light
of
fever
but
he
was
pale
as
death
and
his
general
appearance
was
haggard
and
unkempt
he
had
shaved
off
his
mustache
and
his
hair
was
closely
cropped
both
he
and
herold
wore
the
uniforms
of
confederate
soldiers

by
boston
corbett
the
last
orders
given
to
the
squad
pursuing
booth
were
dont
shoot
booth
but
take
him
alive
just
as
booth
started
to
the
door
of
the
barn
this
order
was
disobeyed
by
a
sergeant
named
boston
corbett
who
fired
through
a
crevice
and
shot
booth
in
the
neck
the
wounded
man
was
carried
out
of
the
barn
and
died
four
hours
afterward
on
the
grass
where
they
had
laid
him
before
he
died
he
whispered
to

baker
tell
mother

died
for
my
country
i
thought
i
did
for
the
best
what
became
of
booths
body
has
always
been
and
probably
always
will
be
a
mystery
many
different
stories
have
been
told
concerning
his
final
resting
place
but
all
that
is
known
positively
is
that
the
body
was
first
taken
to
washington
and
a
postmortem
examination
of
it
held
on
the
monitor
montauk
on
the
night
of
april
th
it
was
turned
over
to
two
men
who
took
it
in
a
rowboat
and
disposed
of
it
secretly
how
they
disposed
of
it
none
but
themselves
know
and
they
have
never
told
fate
of
the
conspirators
the
conspiracy
to
assassinate
the
president
involved
altogether
twentyfive

to
cover
his
case
the
italian
government
gave
him
up
to
the
united

authorities
he
had
two
trials

and
named

in
its
honor
mrs
lincoln
was
a
proud
ambitious
woman
welleducated
speaking
french
fluently
and
familiar
with
the
ways
of
the
best
society
in
lexington
kentucky
where
she
was
born
december
she
was
a
pupil
of
madame
mantelli
whose
celebrated
seminary
in
lexington
was
directly
opposite
the
residence
of
henry
clay
the
conversation
at
the
seminary
was
carried
on
entirely
in
french
she
visited
springfield
illinois
in
remained
three
months
and
then
returned
to
her
native
state
in
she
made
springfield
her
permanent
home
she
lived
with
her
eldest
sister
elizabeth
wife
of
ninian
w
edwards
lincolns
colleague
in
the
legislature
and
it
was
not
strange
she
and
lincoln
should
meet
stephen
a
douglas
was
also
a
friend
of
the
edwards
family
and
a
suitor
for
her
hand
but
she
rejected
him
to
accept
the
future
president
she
was
one
of
the
belles
of
the
town
she
is
thus
described
at
the
time
she
made
her
home
in
springfield
she
was
of
the
average
height
weighing
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
she
was
rather
compactly
built
had
a
well
rounded
face
rich
darkbrown
hair
and
bluishgray
eyes
in
her
bearing
she
was
proud
but
handsome
and
vivacious
she
was
a
good
conversationalist
using
with
equal
fluency
the
french
and
english
languages
when
she
used
a
pen
its
point
was
sure
to
be
sharp
and
she
wrote
with
wit
and
ability
she
not
only
had
a
quick
intellect
but
an
intuitive
judgment
of
men
and
their
motives
ordinarily
she
was
affable
and
even
charming
in
her
manners
but
when
offended
or
antagonized
she
could
be
very
bitter
and
sarcastic
in
her
figure
and
physical
proportions
in
education
bearing
temperament
historyin
everything
she
was
the
exact
reverse
of
lincoln
that
mrs
lincoln
was
very
proud
of
her
husband
there
is
no
doubt
and
it
is
probable
that
she
married
him
largely
from
motives
of
ambition
she
knew
lincoln
better
than
he
knew
himself
she
instinctively
felt
that
he
would
occupy
a
proud
position
some
day
and
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
she
told
ward
lamon
her
husbands
law
partner
that
mr
lincoln
will
yet
be
president
of
the
united
states
mrs
lincoln
was
decidedly
proslavery
in
her
views
but
this
never
disturbed
lincoln
in
various
ways
they
were
unlike
her
fearless
witty
and
austere
nature
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
calm
imperturbable
and
simple
ways
of
her
thoughtful
and
absentminded
husband
she
was
bright
and
sparkling
in
conversation
and
fit
to
grace
any
drawingroom
she
well
knew
that
to
marry
lincoln
meant
not
a
life
of
luxury
and
ease
for
lincoln
was
not
a
man
to
accumulate
wealth
but
in
him
she
saw
position
in
society
prominence
in
the
world
and
the
grandest
social
distinction
by
that
means
her
ambition
was
certainly
satisfied
for
nineteen
years
after
her
marriage
she
was
the
first
lady
of
the
land
and
the
mistress
of
the
white
house
after
his
marriage
by
dint
of
untiring
efforts
and
the
recognition
of
influential
friends
the
couple
managed
through
rare
frugality
to
move
along
in
lincolns
struggles
both
in
the
law
and
for
political
advancement
his
wife
shared
his
sacrifices
she
was
a
plucky
little
woman
and
in
fact
endowed
with
a
more
restless
ambition
than
he
she
was
gifted
with
a
rare
insight
into
the
motives
that
actuate
mankind
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
much
of
lincolns
success
was
in
a
measure
attributable
to
her
acuteness
and
the
stimulus
of
her
influence
his
election
to
congress
within
four
years
after
their
marriage
afforded
her
extreme
gratification
she
loved
power
and
prominence
and
was
inordinately
proud
of
her
tall
and
ungainly
husband
she
saw
in
him
bright
prospects
ahead
and
his
every
move
was
watched
by
her
with
the
closest
interest
if
to
other
persons
he
seemed
homely
to
her
he
was
the
embodiment
of
noble
manhood
and
each
succeeding
day
impressed
upon
her
the
wisdom
of
her
choice
of
lincoln
over
douglasif
in
reality
she
ever
seriously
accepted
the
latters
attentions
mr
lincoln
may
not
be
as
handsome
a
figure
she
said
one
day
in
lincolns
law
office
during
her
husbands
absence
when
the
conversation
turned
on
douglas
but
the
people
are
perhaps
not
aware
that
his
heart
is
as
large
as
his
arms
are
long
