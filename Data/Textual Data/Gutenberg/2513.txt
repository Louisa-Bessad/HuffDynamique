first
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
series
of
articles
which
were
published
in
the
examiner
in

samuel
butler
subsequently
revised
the
text
of
his
work
presumably
with
the
intention
of
republishing
it
though
he
never
carried
the
intention
into
effect
in
the
present
edition
i
have
followed
his
revised
version
almost
without
deviation
i
have
however
retained
a
few
passages
which
butler
proposed
to
omit
partly
because
they
appear
to
me
to
render
the
course
of
his
argument
clearer
and
partly
because
they
contain
characteristic
thoughts
and
expressions
of
which
none
of
his
admirers
would
wish
to
be
deprived

which

published
in

it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
point
out
that
the
three
works
are
closely
akin
in
subject
and
treatment
and
that
god
the

and
god

will
gain

chapter
i
introduction
mankind
has
ever
been
ready
to
discuss
matters
in
the
inverse
ratio
of
their
importance
so
that
the
more
closely
a
question
is
felt
to
touch
the
hearts
of
all
of
us
the
more
incumbent
it
is
considered
upon
prudent
people
to
profess
that
it
does
not
exist
to
frown
it
down
to
tell
it
to
hold
its
tongue
to
maintain
that
it
has
long
been
finally
settled
so
that
there
is
now
no
question
concerning
it
so
far
indeed
has
this
been
carried
through
all
time
past
that
the
actions
which
are
most
important
to
us
such
as
our
passage
through
the
embryonic
stages
the
circulation
of
our
blood
our
respiration
etc
etc
have
long
been
formulated
beyond
all
power
of
reopening
question
concerning
themthe
mere
fact
or
manner
of
their
being
done
at
all
being
ranked
among
the
great
discoveries
of
recent
ages
yet
the
analogy
of
past
settlements
would
lead
us
to
suppose
that
so
much
unanimity
was
not
arrived
at
all
at
once
but
rather
that
it
must
have
been
preceded
by
much
smouldering
sic
discontent
which
again
was
followed
by
open
warfare
and
that
even
after
a
settlement
had
been
ostensibly
arrived
at
there
was
still
much
secret
want
of
conviction
on
the
part
of
many
for
several
generations
there
are
many
who
see
nothing
in
this
tendency
of
our
nature
but
occasion
for
sarcasm
those
on
the
other
hand
who
hold
that
the
world
is
by
this
time
old
enough
to
be
the
best
judge
concerning
the
management
of
its
own
affairs
will
scrutinise
sic
this
management
with
some
closeness
before
they
venture
to
satirise
sic
it
nor
will
they
do
so
for
long
without
finding
justification
for
its
apparent
recklessness
for
we
must
all
fear
responsibility
upon
matters
about
which
we
feel
we
know
but
little
on
the
other
hand
we
must
all
continually
act
and
for
the
most
part
promptly
we
do
so
therefore
with
greater
security
when
we
can
persuade
both
ourselves
and
others
that
a
matter
is
already
pigeonholed
than
if
we
feel
that
we
must
use
our
own
judgment
for
the
collection
interpretation
and
arrangement
of
the
papers
which
deal
with
it
moreover
our
action
is
thus
made
to
appear
as
if
it
received
collective
sanction
and
by
so
appearing
it
receives
it
almost
any
settlement
again
is
felt
to
be
better
than
none
and
the
more
nearly
a
matter
comes
home
to
everyone
the
more
important
is
it
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
sleeping
dog
and
be
let
to
lie
for
if
one
person
begins
to
open
his
mouth
fatal
developments
may
arise
in
the
babel
that
will
follow
it
is
not
difficult
indeed
to
show
that
instead
of
having
reason
to
complain
of
the
desire
for
the
postponement
of
important
questions
as
though
the
world
were
composed
mainly
of
knaves
or
fools
such
fixity
as
animal
and
vegetable
forms
possess
is
due
to
this
very
instinct
for
if
there
had
been
no
reluctance
if
there
were
no
friction
and
vis
inertae
to
be
encountered
even
after
a
theoretical
equilibrium
had
been
upset
we
should
have
had
no
fixed
organs
nor
settled
proclivities
but
should
have
been
daily
and
hourly
undergoing
protean
transformations
and
have
still
been
throwing
out
pseudopodia
like
the
amoeba
true
we
might
have
come
to
like
this
fashion
of
living
as
well
as
our
more
steadygoing
system
if
we
had
taken
to
it
many
millions
of
ages
ago
when
we
were
yet
young
but
we
have
contracted
other
habits
which
have
become
so
confirmed
that
we
cannot
break
with
them
we
therefore
now
hate
that
which
we
should
perhaps
have
loved
if
we
had
practised
sic
it
this
however
does
not
affect
the
argument
for
our
concern
is
with
our
likes
and
dislikes
not
with
the
manner
in
which
those
likes
and
dislikes
have
come
about
the
discovery
that
organism
is
capable
of
modification
at
all
has
occasioned
so
much
astonishment
that
it
has
taken
the
most
enlightened
part
of
the
world
more
than
a
hundred
years
to
leave
off
expressing
its
contempt
for
such
a
crude
shallow
and
preposterous
conception
perhaps
in
another
hundred
years
we
shall
learn
to
admire
the
good
sense
endurance
and
thorough
englishness
of
organism
in
having
been
so
averse
to
change
even
more
than
its
versatility
in
having
been
willing
to
change
so
much
nevertheless
however
conservative
we
may
be
and
however
much
alive
to
the
folly
and
wickedness
of
tampering
with
settled
convictionsno
matter
what
they
arewithout
sufficient
cause
there
is
yet
such
a
constant
though
gradual
change
in
our
surroundings
as
necessitates
corresponding
modification
in
our
ideas
desires
and
actions
we
may
think
that
we
should
like
to
find
ourselves
always
in
the
same
surroundings
as
our
ancestors
so
that
we
might
be
guided
at
every
touch
and
turn
by
the
experience
of
our
race
and
be
saved
from
all
selfcommuning
or
interpretation
of
oracular
responses
uttered
by
the
facts
around
us
yet
the
facts
will
change
their
utterances
in
spite
of
us
and
we
too
change
with
age
and
ages
in
spite
of
ourselves
so
as
to
see
the
facts
around
us
as
perhaps
even
more
changed
than
they
actually
are
it
has
been
said
tempora
mutantur
nos
et
mutamur
in
illis
the
passage
would
have
been
no
less
true
if
it
had
stood
nos
mutamur
et
tempora
mutantur
in
nobis
whether
the
organism
or
the
surroundings
began
changing
first
is
a
matter
of
such
small
moment
that
the
two
may
be
left
to
fight
it
out
between
themselves
but
whichever
view
is
taken
the
fact
will
remain
that
whenever
the
relations
between
the
organism
and
its
surroundings
have
been
changed
the
organism
must
either
succeed
in
putting
the
surroundings
into
harmony
with
itself
or
itself
into
harmony
with
the
surroundings
or
must
be
made
so
uncomfortable
as
to
be
unable
to
remember
itself
as
subjected
to
any
such
difficulties
and
therefore
to
die
through
inability
to
recognise
sic
its
own
identity
further
under
these
circumstances
organism
must
act
in
one
or
other
of
these
two
ways
it
must
either
change
slowly
and
continuously
with
the
surroundings
paying
cash
for
everything
meeting
the
smallest
change
with
a
corresponding
modification
so
far
as
is
found
convenient
or
it
must
put
off
change
as
long
as
possible
and
then
make
larger
and
more
sweeping
changes
both
these
courses
are
the
same
in
principle
the
difference
being
only
one
of
scale
and
the
one
being
a
miniature
of
the
other
as
a
ripple
is
an
atlantic
wave
in
little
both
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
so
that
most
organisms
will
take
the
one
course
for
one
set
of
things
and
the
other
for
another
they
will
deal
promptly
with
things
which
they
can
get
at
easily
and
which
lie
more
upon
the
surface
those
however
which
are
more
troublesome
to
reach
and
lie
deeper
will
be
handled
upon
more
cataclysmic
principles
being
allowed
longer
periods
of
repose
followed
by
short
periods
of
greater
activity
animals
breathe
and
circulate
their
blood
by
a
little
action
many
times
a
minute
but
they
feed
some
of
them
only
two
or
three
times
a
day
and
breed
for
the
most
part
not
more
than
once
a
year
their
breeding
season
being
much
their
busiest
time
it
is
on
the
first
principle
that
the
modification
of
animal
forms
has
proceeded
mainly
but
it
may
be
questioned
whether
what
is
called
a
sport
is
not
the
organic
expression
of
discontent
which
has
been
long
felt
but
which
has
not
been
attended
to
nor
been
met
step
by
step
by
as
much
small
remedial
modification
as
was
found
practicable
so
that
when
a
change
does
come
it
comes
by
way
of
revolution
or
again
only
that
it
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
a
sport
may
be
compared
to
one
of
those
happy
thoughts
which
sometimes
come
to
us
unbidden
after
we
have
been
thinking
for
a
long
time
what
to
do
or
how
to
arrange
our
ideas
and
have
yet
been
unable
to
arrive
at
any
conclusion
so
with
politics
the
smaller
the
matter
the
prompter
as
a
general
rule
the
settlement
on
the
other
hand
the
more
sweeping
the
change
that
is
felt
to
be
necessary
the
longer
it
will
be
deferred
the
advantages
of
dealing
with
the
larger
questions
by
more
cataclysmic
methods
are
obvious
for
in
the
first
place
all
composite
things
must
have
a
system
or
arrangement
of
parts
so
that
some
parts
shall
depend
upon
and
be
grouped
round
others
as
in
the
articulation
of
a
skeleton
and
the
arrangement
of
muscles
nerves
tendons
etc
which
are
attached
to
it
to
meddle
with
the
skeleton
is
like
taking
up
the
street
or
the
flooring
of
ones
house
it
so
upsets
our
arrangements
that
we
put
it
off
till
whatever
else
is
found
wanted
or
whatever
else
seems
likely
to
be
wanted
for
a
long
time
hence
can
be
done
at
the
same
time
another
advantage
is
in
the
rest
which
is
given
to
the
attention
during
the
long
hollows
so
to
speak
of
the
waves
between
the
periods
of
resettlement
passion
and
prejudice
have
time
to
calm
down
and
when
attention
is
next
directed
to
the
same
question
it
is
a
refreshed
and
invigorated
attentionan
attention
moreover
which
may
be
given
with
the
help
of
new
lights
derived
from
other
quarters
that
were
not
luminous
when
the
question
was
last
considered
thirdly
it
is
more
easy
and
safer
to
make
such
alterations
as
experience
has
proved
to
be
necessary
than
to
forecast
what
is
going
to
be
wanted
reformers
are
like
paymasters
of
whom
there
are
only
two
bad
kinds
those
who
pay
too
soon
and
those
who
do
not
pay
at
all
chapter
ii
common
ground
i
have
now
perhaps
sufficiently
proved
my
sympathy
with
the
reluctance
felt
by
many
to
tolerate
discussion
upon
such
a
subject
as
the
existence
and
nature
of
god
i
trust
that
i
may
have
made
the
reader
feel
that
he
need
fear
no
sarcasm
or
levity
in
my
treatment
of
the
subject
which
i
have
chosen
i
will
therefore
proceed
to
sketch
out
a
plan
of
what
i
hope
to
establish
and
this
in
no
doubtful
or
unnatural
sense
but
by
attaching
the
same
meanings
to
words
as
those
which
we
usually
attach
to
them
and
with
the
same
certainty
precision
and
clearness
as
anything
else
is
established
which
is
commonly
called
known
as
to
what
god
is
beyond
the
fact
that
he
is
the
spirit
and
the
life
which
creates
governs
and
upholds
all
living
things
i
can
say
nothing
i
cannot
pretend
that
i
can
show
more
than
others
have
done
in
what
spirit
and
the
life
consists
which
governs
living
things
and
animates
them
i
cannot
show
the
connection
between
consciousness
and
the
will
and
the
organ
much
less
can
i
tear
away
the
veil
from
the
face
of
god
so
as
to
show
wherein
will
and
consciousness
consist
no
philosopher
whether
christian
or
rationalist
has
attempted
this
without
discomfiture
but
i
can
i
hope
do
two
things
firstly
i
can
demonstrate
perhaps
more
clearly
than
modern
science
is
prepared
to
admit
that
there
does
exist
a
single
being
or
animator
of
all
living
thingsa
single
spirit
whom
we
cannot
think
of
under
any
meaner
name
than
god
and
secondly
i
can
show
something
more
of
the
persona
or
bodily
expression
mask
and
mouthpiece
of
this
vast
living
spirit
than
i
know
of
as
having
been
familiarly
expressed
elsewhere
or
as
being
accessible
to
myself
or
others
though
doubtless
many
works
exist
in
which
what
i
am
going
to
say
has
been
already
said
aware
that
much
of
this
is
widely
accepted
under
the
name
of
pantheism
i
venture
to
think
it
differs
from
pantheism
with
all
the
difference
that
exists
between
a
coherent
intelligible
conception
and
an
incoherent
unintelligible
one
i
shall
therefore
proceed
to
examine
the
doctrine
called
pantheism
and
to
show
how
incomprehensible
and
valueless
it
is
i
will
then
indicate
the
living
and
personal
god
about
whose
existence
and
about
many
of
whose
attributes
there
is
no
room
for
question
i
will
show
that
man
has
been
so
far
made
in
the
likeness
of
this
person
or
god
that
he
possesses
all
its
essential
characteristics
and
that
it
is
this
god
who
has
called
man
and
all
other
living
forms
whether
animals
or
plants
into
existence
so
that
our
bodies
are
the
temples
of
his
spirit
that
it
is
this
which
sustains
them
in
their
life
and
growth
who
is
one
with
them
living
moving
and
having
his
being
in
them
in
whom
also
they
live
and
move
they
in
him
and
he
in
them
he
being
not
a
trinity
in
unity
only
but
an
infinity
in
unity
and
a
unity
in
an
infinity
eternal
in
time
past
for
so
much
time
at
least
that
our
minds
can
come
no
nearer
to
eternity
than
this
eternal
for
the
future
as
long
as
the
universe
shall
exist
ever
changing
yet
the
same
yesterday
and
today
and
for
ever
and
i
will
show
this
with
so
little
ambiguity
that
it
shall
be
perceived
not
as
a
phantom
or
hallucination
following
upon
a
painful
straining
of
the
mind
and
a
vain
endeavour
sic
to
give
coherency
to
incoherent
and
inconsistent
ideas
but
with
the
same
ease
comfort
and
palpable
fleshandblood
clearness
with
which
we
see
those
near
to
us
whom
though
we
see
them
at
the
best
as
through
a
glass
darkly
we
still
see
face
to
face
even
as
we
are
ourselves
seen
i
will
also
show
in
what
way
this
being
exercises
a
moral
government
over
the
world
and
rewards
and
punishes
us
according
to
his
own
laws
having
done
this
i
shall
proceed
to
compare
this
conception
of
god
with
those
that
are
currently
accepted
and
will
endeavour
sic
to
show
that
the
ideas
now
current
are
in
truth
efforts
to
grasp
the
one
on
which
i
shall
here
insist
finally
i
shall
persuade
the
reader
that
the
differences
between
the
socalled
atheist
and
the
socalled
theist
are
differences
rather
about
words
than
things
inasmuch
as
not
even
the
most
prosaic
of
modern
scientists
will
be
inclined
to
deny
the
existence
of
this
god
while
few
theists
will
feel
that
this
the
natural
conception
of
god
is
a
less
worthy
one
than
that
to
which
they
have
been
accustomed
chapter
iii
pantheism
the
rev
j
h
blunt
in
his
dictionary
of
sects
heresies
etc
defines
pantheists
as
those
who
hold
that
god
is
everything
and
everything
is
god
if
it
is
granted
that
the
value
of
words
lies
in
the
definiteness
and
coherency
of
the
ideas
that
present
themselves
to
us
when
the
words
are
heard
or
spokenthen
such
a
sentence
as
god
is
everything
and
everything
is
god
is
worthless
for
we
have
so
long
associated
the
word
god
with
the
idea
of
a
living
person
who
can
see
hear
will
feel
pleasure
displeasure
etc
that
we
cannot
think
of
god
and
also
of
something
which
we
have
not
been
accustomed
to
think
of
as
a
living
person
at
one
and
the
same
time
so
as
to
connect
the
two
ideas
and
fuse
them
into
a
coherent
thought
while
we
are
thinking
of
the
one
our
minds
involuntarily
exclude
the
other
and
vice
versa
so
that
it
is
as
impossible
for
us
to
think
of
anything
as
god
or
as
forming
part
of
god
which
we
cannot
also
think
of
as
a
person
or
as
a
part
of
a
person
as
it
is
to
produce
a
hybrid
between
two
widely
distinct
animals
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
barrenness
of
inconsistent
ideas
and
the
sterility
of
widely
distant
species
or
genera
of
plants
and
animals
are
one
in
principlesterility
of
hybrids
being
due
to
barrenness
of
ideas
and
barrenness
of
ideas
arising
from
inability
to
fuse
unfamiliar
thoughts
into
a
coherent
conception
i
have
insisted
on
this
at
some
length
in
life
and
habit
but
can
do
so
no
further
here
note
butler
returned
to
this
subject
in
luck
or
cunning
which
was
originally
published
in
in
like
manner
we
have
so
long
associated
the
word
person
with
the
idea
of
a
substantial
visible
body
limited
in
extent
and
animated
by
an
invisible
something
which
we
call
spirit
that
we
can
think
of
nothing
as
a
person
which
does
not
also
bring
these
ideas
before
us
any
attempt
to
make
us
imagine
god
as
a
person
who
does
not
fulfil
sic
the
conditions
which
our
ideas
attach
to
the
word
person
is
ipso
facto
atheistic
as
rendering
the
word
god
without
meaning
and
therefore
without
reality
and
therefore
nonexistent
to
us
our
ideas
are
like
our
organism
they
will
stand
a
vast
amount
of
modification
if
it
is
effected
slowly
and
without
shock
but
the
life
departs
out
of
them
leaving
the
form
of
an
idea
without
the
power
thereof
if
they
are
jarred
too
rudely
any
being
then
whom
we
can
imagine
as
god
must
have
all
the
qualities
capabilities
and
also
all
the
limitations
which
are
implied
when
the
word
person
is
used
but
again
we
cannot
conceive
of
everything
as
a
person
everything
must
comprehend
all
that
is
to
be
found
on
earth
or
outside
of
it
and
we
know
of
no
such
persons
as
this
when
we
say
persons
we
intend
living
people
with
flesh
and
blood
sometimes
we
extend
our
conceptions
to
animals
and
plants
but
we
have
not
hitherto
done
so
as
generally
as
i
hope
we
shall
some
day
come
to
do
below
animals
and
plants
we
have
never
in
any
seriousness
gone
all
that
we
have
been
able
to
regard
as
personal
has
had
what
we
can
call
a
living
body
even
though
that
body
is
vegetable
only
and
this
body
has
been
tangible
and
has
been
comprised
within
certain
definite
limits
or
within
limits
which
have
at
any
rate
struck
the
eye
as
definite
and
every
part
within
these
limits
has
been
animated
by
an
unseen
something
which
we
call
soul
or
spirit
a
person
must
be
a
personathat
is
to
say
the
living
mask
and
mouthpiece
of
an
energy
saturating
it
and
speaking
through
it
it
must
be
animate
in
all
its
parts
but
everything
is
not
animate
animals
and
plants
alone
produce
in
us
those
ideas
which
can
make
reasonable
people
call
them
persons
with
consistency
of
intention
we
can
conceive
of
each
animal
and
of
each
plant
as
a
person
we
can
conceive
again
of
a
compound
person
like
the
coral
polypes
sic
or
like
a
tree
which
is
composed
of
a
congeries
of
subordinate
persons
inasmuch
as
each
bud
is
a
separate
and
individual
plant
we
can
go
farther
than
this
and
as
i
shall
hope
to
show
we
ought
to
do
so
that
is
to
say
we
shall
find
it
easier
and
more
agreeable
with
our
other
ideas
to
go
farther
than
not
for
we
should
see
all
animal
and
vegetable
life
as
united
by
a
subtle
and
till
lately
invisible
ramification
so
that
all
living
things
are
one
treelike
growth
forming
a
single
person
but
we
cannot
conceive
of
oceans
continents
and
air
as
forming
parts
of
a
person
at
all
much
less
can
we
think
of
them
as
forming
one
person
with
the
living
forms
that
inhabit
them
to
ask
this
of
us
is
like
asking
us
to
see
the
bowl
and
the
water
in
which
three
goldfish
are
swimming
as
part
of
the
goldfish
we
cannot
do
it
any
more
than
we
can
do
something
physically
impossible
we
can
see
the
goldfish
as
forming
one
family
and
therefore
as
in
a
way
united
to
the
personality
of
the
parents
from
which
they
sprang
and
therefore
as
members
one
of
another
and
therefore
as
forming
a
single
growth
of
goldfish
as
boughs
and
buds
unite
to
form
a
tree
but
we
cannot
by
any
effort
of
the
imagination
introduce
the
bowl
and
the
water
into
the
personality
for
we
have
never
been
accustomed
to
think
of
such
things
as
living
and
personal
those
therefore
who
tell
us
that
god
is
everything
and
everything
is
god
require
us
to
see
everything
as
a
person
which
we
cannot
or
god
as
not
a
person
which
again
we
cannot
continuing
the
article
of
mr
blunt
from
which
i
have
already
quoted
i
read
linus
in
a
passage
which
has
been
preserved
by
stobaeus
exactly
expresses
the
notion
afterwards
adopted
by
spinoza
one
sole
energy
governs
all
things
all
things
are
unity
and
each
portion
is
all
for
of
one
integer
all
things
were
born
in
the
end
of
time
all
things
shall
again
become
unity
the
unity
of
multiplicity
orpheus
his
disciple
taught
no
other
doctrine
according
to
pythagoras
an
adept
in
the
orphic
philosophy
the
soul
of
the
world
is
the
divine
energy
which
interpenetrates
every
portion
of
the
mass
and
the
soul
of
man
is
an
efflux
of
that
energy
the
world
too
is
an
exact
impress
of
the
eternal
idea
which
is
the
mind
of
god
john
scotus
erigena
taught
that
all
is
god
and
god
is
all
william
of
champeaux
again
two
hundred
years
later
maintained
that
all
individuality
is
one
in
substance
and
varies
only
in
its
nonessential
accidents
and
transient
properties
amalric
of
bena
and
david
of
dinant
followed
the
theory
out
into
a
thoroughgoing
pantheism
amalric
held
that
all
is
god
and
god
is
all
the
creator
and
the
creature
are
one
being
ideas
are
at
once
creative
and
created
subjective
and
objective
god
is
the
end
of
all
and
all
return
to
him
as
every
variety
of
humanity
forms
one
manhood
so
the
world
contains
individual
forms
of
one
eternal
essence
david
of
dinant
only
varied
upon
this
by
imagining
a
corporeal
unity
although
body
soul
and
eternal
substance
are
three
these
three
are
one
and
the
same
being
giordano
bruno
maintained
the
world
of
sense
to
be
a
vast
animal
having
the
deity
for
its
living
soul
the
inanimate
part
of
the
world
is
thus
excluded
from
participation
in
the
deity
and
a
conception
that
our
minds
can
embrace
is
offered
us
instead
of
one
which
they
cannot
entertain
except
as
in
a
dream
incoherently
but
without
such
a
view
of
evolution
as
was
prevalent
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
world
of
sense
intelligently
as
forming
a
vast
animal
unless
therefore
giordano
bruno
held
the
opinions
of
buffon
dr
erasmus
darwin
and
lamarck
with
more
definiteness
than
i
am
yet
aware
of
his
having
done
his
contention
must
be
considered
as
a
splendid
prophecy
but
as
little
more
than
a
prophecy
he
continues
birth
is
expansion
from
the
one
centre
of
life
life
is
its
continuance
and
death
is
the
necessary
return
of
the
ray
to
the
centre
of
light
this
begins
finely
but
ends
mystically
i
have
not
however
compared
the
english
translation
with
the
original
and
must
reserve
a
fuller
examination
of
giordano
brunos
teaching
for
another
opportunity
spinoza
disbelieved
in
the
world
rather
than
in
god
he
was
an
acosmist
to
use
jacobis
expression
rather
than
an
atheist
according
to
him
the
deity
and
the
universe
are
but
one
substance
at
the
same
time
both
spirit
and
matter
thought
and
extension
which
are
the
only
known
attributes
of
the
deity
my
readers
will
i
think
agree
with
me
that
there
is
very
little
of
the
above
which
conveys
ideas
with
the
fluency
and
comfort
which
accompany
good
words
words
are
like
servants
it
is
not
enough
that
we
should
have
themwe
must
have
the
most
able
and
willing
that
we
can
find
and
at
the
smallest
wages
that
will
content
them
having
got
them
we
must
make
the
best
and
not
the
worst
of
them
surely
in
the
greater
part
of
what
has
been
quoted
above
the
words
are
barren
letters
only
they
do
not
quicken
within
us
and
enable
us
to
conceive
a
thought
such
as
we
can
in
our
turn
impress
upon
dead
matter
and
mould
sic
that
matter
into
another
shape
than
its
own
through
the
thought
which
has
become
alive
within
us
no
offspring
of
ideas
has
followed
upon
them
or
if
any
at
all
yet
in
such
unwonted
shape
and
with
such
want
of
alacrity
that
we
loathe
them
as
malformations
and
miscarriages
of
our
minds
granted
that
if
we
examine
them
closely
we
shall
at
length
find
them
to
embody
a
little
germ
of
truththat
is
to
say
of
coherency
with
our
other
ideas
but
there
is
too
little
truth
in
proportion
to
the
trouble
necessary
to
get
at
it
we
can
get
more
truth
that
is
to
say
more
coherencyfor
truth
and
coherency
are
onefor
less
trouble
in
other
ways
but
it
may
be
urged
that
the
beginnings
of
all
tasks
are
difficult
and
unremunerative
and
that
later
developments
of
pantheism
may
be
more
intelligible
than
the
earlier
ones
unfortunately
this
is
not
the
case
on
continuing
mr
blunts
article
i
find
the
later
pantheists
a
hundredfold
more
perplexing
than
the
earlier
ones
with
kant
schelling
fichte
and
hegel
we
feel
that
we
are
with
men
who
have
been
decoyed
into
a
hopeless
quagmire
we
understand
nothing
of
their
languagewe
doubt
whether
they
understand
themselves
and
feel
that
we
can
do
nothing
with
them
but
look
at
them
and
pass
them
by
in
my
next
chapter
i
propose
to
show
the
end
which
the
early
pantheists
were
striving
after
and
the
reason
and
naturalness
of
their
error
chapter
iv
pantheism
the
earlier
pantheists
were
misled
by
the
endeavour
sic
to
lay
hold
of
two
distinct
ideas
the
one
of
which
was
a
reality
that
has
since
been
grasped
and
is
of
inestimable
value
the
other
a
phantom
which
has
misled
all
who
have
followed
it
the
reality
is
the
unity
of
life
the
oneness
of
the
guiding
and
animating
spirit
which
quickens
animals
and
plants
so
that
they
are
all
the
outcome
and
expression
of
a
common
mind
and
are
in
truth
one
animal
the
phantom
is
the
endeavour
sic
to
find
the
origin
of
things
to
reach
the
fountainhead
of
all
energy
and
thus
to
lay
the
foundations
on
which
a
philosophy
may
be
constructed
which
none
can
accuse
of
being
baseless
or
of
arguing
in
a
circle
in
following
as
through
a
thick
wood
after
the
phantom
our
forefathers
from
time
to
time
caught
glimpses
of
the
reality
which
seemed
so
wonderful
as
it
eluded
them
and
flitted
back
again
into
the
thickets
that
they
declared
it
must
be
the
phantom
they
were
in
search
of
which
was
thus
evidenced
as
actually
existing
whereon
instead
of
mastering
such
of
the
facts
they
met
with
as
could
be
captured
easilywhich
facts
would
have
betrayed
the
hidingplaces
of
others
and
these
again
of
others
and
so
ad
infinitumthey
overlooked
what
was
within
their
reach
and
followed
hotly
through
brier
and
brake
after
an
imaginary
greater
prize
great
thoughts
are
not
to
be
caught
in
this
way
they
must
present
themselves
for
capture
of
their
own
free
will
or
be
taken
after
a
little
coyness
only
they
are
like
wealth
and
power
which
if
a
man
is
not
born
to
them
are
the
more
likely
to
take
him
the
more
he
has
restrained
himself
from
an
attempt
to
snatch
them
they
hanker
after
those
only
who
have
tamed
their
nearer
thoughts
nevertheless
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
that
the
early
pantheists
were
true
prophets
and
seers
though
the
things
were
unknown
to
them
without
which
a
complete
view
was
unattainable
what
does
linus
mean
we
ask
ourselves
when
he
saysone
sole
energy
governs
all
things
how
can
one
sole
energy
govern
we
will
say
the
reader
and
the
chair
on
which
he
sits
what
is
meant
by
an
energy
governing
a
chair
if
by
an
effort
we
have
made
ourselves
believe
we
understand
something
which
can
be
better
expressed
by
these
words
than
by
any
others
no
sooner
do
we
turn
our
backs
than
the
ideas
so
painfully
collected
fly
apart
again
no
matter
how
often
we
go
in
search
of
them
and
force
them
into
juxtaposition
they
prove
to
have
none
of
that
innate
coherent
power
with
which
ideas
combine
that
we
can
hold
as
true
and
profitable
yet
if
linus
had
confined
his
statement
to
living
things
and
had
said
that
one
sole
energy
governed
all
plants
and
animals
he
would
have
come
near
both
to
being
intelligible
and
true
for
if
as
we
now
believe
all
animals
and
plants
are
descended
from
a
single
cell
they
must
be
considered
as
cousins
to
one
another
and
as
forming
a
single
treelike
animal
every
individual
plant
or
animal
of
which
is
as
truly
one
and
the
same
person
with
the
primordial
cell
as
the
oak
a
thousand
years
old
is
one
and
the
same
plant
with
the
acorn
out
of
which
it
has
grown
this
is
easily
understood
but
will
i
trust
be
made
to
appear
simpler
presently
when
linus
says
all
things
are
unity
and
each
portion
is
all
for
of
one
integer
all
things
were
born
it
is
impossible
for
plain
peoplewho
do
not
wish
to
use
words
unless
they
mean
the
same
things
by
them
as
both
they
and
others
have
been
in
the
habit
of
meaningto
understand
what
is
intended
how
can
each
portion
be
all
how
can
one
londoner
be
all
london
i
know
that
this
too
can
in
a
way
be
shown
but
the
resulting
idea
is
too
far
to
fetch
and
when
fetched
does
not
fit
in
well
enough
with
our
other
ideas
to
give
it
practical
and
commercial
value
how
again
can
all
things
be
said
to
be
born
of
one
integer
unless
the
statement
is
confined
to
living
things
which
can
alone
be
born
at
all
and
unless
a
theory
of
evolution
is
intended
such
as
linus
would
hardly
have
accepted
yet
limit
the
all
things
to
all
living
things
grant
the
theory
of
evolution
and
explain
each
portion
is
all
to
mean
that
all
life
is
akin
and
possesses
the
same
essential
fundamental
characteristics
and
it
is
surprising
how
nearly
linus
approaches
both
to
truth
and
intelligibility
it
may
be
said
that
the
animate
and
the
inanimate
have
the
same
fundamental
substance
so
that
a
chair
might
rot
and
be
absorbed
by
grass
which
grass
might
be
eaten
by
a
cow
which
cow
might
be
eaten
by
a
man
and
by
similar
processes
the
man
might
become
a
chair
but
these
facts
are
not
presented
to
the
mind
by
saying
that
one
energy
governs
all
thingsa
chair
we
will
say
and
a
man
we
could
only
say
that
one
energy
governed
a
man
and
a
chair
if
the
chair
were
a
reasonable
living
person
who
was
actively
and
consciously
engaged
in
helping
the
man
to
attain
a
certain
end
unless
that
is
to
say
we
are
to
depart
from
all
usual
interpretation
of
words
in
which
case
we
invalidate
the
advantages
of
language
and
all
the
sanctions
of
morality
all
things
shall
again
become
unity
is
intelligible
as
meaning
that
all
things
probably
have
come
from
a
single
elementary
substance
say
hydrogen
or
what
not
and
that
they
will
return
to
it
but
the
explanation
of
unity
as
being
the
unity
of
multiplicity
puzzles
if
there
is
any
meaning
it
is
too
recondite
to
be
of
service
to
us
what
again
is
meant
by
saying
that
the
soul
of
the
world
is
the
divine
energy
which
interpenetrates
every
portion
of
the
mass
the
soul
of
the
world
is
an
expression
which
to
myself
and
i
should
imagine
to
most
people
is
without
propriety
we
cannot
think
of
the
world
except
as
earth
air
and
water
in
this
or
that
state
on
and
in
which
there
grow
plants
and
animals
what
is
meant
by
saying
that
earth
has
a
soul
and
lives
does
it
move
from
place
to
place
erratically
does
it
feed
does
it
reproduce
itself
does
it
make
such
noises
or
commit
such
vagaries
as
shall
make
us
say
that
it
feels
can
it
achieve
its
ends
and
fail
of
achieving
them
through
mistake
if
it
cannot
how
has
it
a
soul
more
than
a
dead
man
has
a
soul
out
of
whom
we
say
that
the
soul
has
departed
and
whose
body
we
conceive
of
as
returning
to
dead
earth
inasmuch
as
it
is
now
soulless
is
there
any
unnatural
violence
which
can
be
done
to
our
thoughts
by
which
we
can
bring
the
ideas
of
a
soul
and
of
water
or
of
a
stone
into
combination
and
keep
them
there
for
long
together
the
ancients
indeed
said
they
believed
their
rivers
to
be
gods
and
carved
likenesses
of
them
under
the
forms
of
men
but
even
supposing
this
to
have
been
their
real
mind
can
it
by
any
conceivable
means
become
our
own
granted
that
a
stone
is
kept
from
falling
to
dust
by
an
energy
which
compels
its
particles
to
cohere
which
energy
can
be
taken
out
of
it
and
converted
into
some
other
form
of
energy
granted
which
may
or
may
not
be
true
also
that
the
life
of
a
living
body
is
only
the
energy
which
keeps
the
particles
which
compose
it
in
a
certain
disposition
and
granted
that
the
energy
of
the
stone
may
be
convertible
into
the
energy
of
a
living
form
and
that
thus
after
a
long
journey
a
tired
idea
may
lag
after
the
sound
of
such
words
as
the
soul
of
the
world
granted
all
the
above
nevertheless
to
speak
of
the
world
as
having
a
soul
is
not
sufficiently
in
harmony
with
our
common
notions
nor
does
it
go
sufficiently
with
the
grain
of
our
thoughts
to
render
the
expression
a
meaning
one
or
one
that
can
be
now
used
with
any
propriety
or
fitness
except
by
those
who
do
not
know
their
own
meaninglessness
vigorous
minds
will
harbour
sic
vigorous
thoughts
only
or
such
as
bid
fair
to
become
so
and
vigorous
thoughts
are
always
simple
definite
and
in
harmony
with
everyday
ideas
we
can
imagine
a
soul
as
living
in
the
lowest
slime
that
moves
feeds
reproduces
itself
remembers
and
dies
the
amoeba
wants
things
knows
it
wants
them
alters
itself
so
as
to
try
and
alter
them
thus
preparing
for
an
intended
modification
of
outside
matter
by
a
preliminary
modification
of
itself
it
thrives
if
the
modification
from
within
is
followed
by
the
desired
modification
in
the
external
object
it
knows
that
it
is
well
and
breeds
more
freely
in
consequence
if
it
cannot
get
hold
of
outside
matter
or
cannot
proselytise
sic
that
matter
and
persuade
it
to
see
things
through
its
own
the
amoebas
spectaclesif
it
cannot
convert
that
matter
if
the
matter
persists
in
disagreeing
with
itits
spirits
droop
its
soul
is
disquieted
within
it
it
becomes
listless
like
a
withering
flowerit
languishes
and
dies
we
cannot
imagine
a
thing
to
live
at
all
and
yet
be
soulless
except
in
sleep
for
a
short
time
and
even
so
not
quite
soulless
the
idea
of
a
soul
or
of
that
unknown
something
for
which
the
word
soul
is
our
hieroglyphic
and
the
idea
of
living
organism
unite
so
spontaneously
and
stick
together
so
inseparably
that
no
matter
how
often
we
sunder
them
they
will
elude
our
vigilance
and
come
together
like
true
lovers
in
spite
of
us
let
us
not
attempt
to
divorce
ideas
that
have
so
long
been
wedded
together
i
submit
then
that
pantheism
even
as
explained
by
those
who
had
entered
on
the
outskirts
only
of
its
great
morass
nevertheless
holds
out
so
little
hope
of
leading
to
any
comfortable
conclusion
that
it
will
be
more
reasonable
to
occupy
our
minds
with
other
matter
than
to
follow
pantheism
further
the
pantheists
speak
of
a
person
without
meaning
a
person
they
speak
of
a
him
and
a
he
without
having
in
their
minds
the
idea
of
a
living
person
with
all
its
inevitable
limitations
pantheism
is
therefore
as
is
said
by
mr
blunt
in
another
article
practically
nothing
else
than
atheism
it
has
no
belief
in
a
personal
deity
overruling
the
affairs
of
the
world
as
divine
providence
and
is
therefore
atheistic
and
again
theism
believes
in
a
spirit
superior
to
matter
and
so
does
pantheism
but
the
spirit
of
theism
is
selfconscious
and
therefore
personal
and
of
individual
existencea
nature
per
se
and
upholding
all
things
by
an
active
control
while
pantheism
believes
in
spirit
that
is
of
a
higher
nature
than
brute
matter
but
is
a
mere
unconscious
principle
of
life
impersonal
irrational
as
the
brute
matter
that
it
quickens
if
this
verdict
concerning
pantheism
is
trueand
from
all
i
can
gather
it
is
as
nearly
true
as
anything
can
be
said
to
be
which
is
predicated
of
an
incoherent
ideathe
pantheistic
god
is
an
attempt
to
lay
hold
of
a
truth
which
has
nevertheless
eluded
its
pursuers
in
my
next
chapter
i
will
consider
the
commonly
received
orthodox
conception
of
god
and
compare
it
with
the
pantheistic
i
will
show
that
it
too
is
atheistic
inasmuch
as
in
spite
of
its
professing
to
give
us
a
conception
of
god
it
raises
no
ideas
in
our
minds
of
a
person
or
living
beingand
a
god
who
is
not
this
is
nonexistent
chapter
v
orthodox
theism
we
have
seen
that
pantheism
fails
to
satisfy
inasmuch
as
it
requires
us
to
mean
something
different
by
the
word
god
from
what
we
have
been
in
the
habit
of
meaning
i
have
already
saidi
fear
too
oftenthat
no
conception
of
god
can
have
any
value
or
meaning
for
us
which
does
not
involve
his
existence
as
an
independent
living
person
of
ineffable
wisdom
and
power
vastness
and
duration
both
in
the
past
and
for
the
future
if
such
a
being
as
this
can
be
found
existing
and
made
evident
directly
or
indirectly
to
human
senses
there
is
a
god
if
otherwise
there
is
no
god
or
none
at
any
rate
so
far
as
we
can
know
none
with
whom
we
need
concern
ourselves
no
conscious
personality
no
god
an
impersonal
god
is
as
much
a
contradiction
in
terms
as
an
impersonal
person
unfortunately
when
we
question
orthodox
theology
closely
we
find
that
it
supposes
god
to
be
a
person
who
has
no
material
body
such
as
could
come
within
the
range
of
any
human
sense
and
make
an
impression
upon
it
he
is
supposed
to
be
of
a
spiritual
nature
only
except
in
so
far
as
one
part
of
his
triune
personality
is
according
to
the
athanasian
creed
perfect
man
of
a
reasonable
soul
and
human
flesh
subsisting
here
then
we
find
ourselves
in
a
dilemma
on
the
one
hand
we
are
involved
in
the
same
difficulty
as
in
the
case
of
pantheism
inasmuch
as
a
person
without
flesh
and
blood
or
something
analogous
is
not
a
person
we
are
required
therefore
to
believe
in
a
personal
god
who
has
no
true
person
to
believe
that
is
to
say
in
an
impersonal
person
this
as
we
have
seen
already
is
atheism
under
another
name
being
as
it
is
destructive
of
all
idea
of
god
whatever
for
these
words
do
not
convey
an
idea
of
something
which
human
intelligence
can
understand
up
to
a
certain
point
and
which
it
can
watch
going
out
of
sight
into
regions
beyond
our
view
but
in
the
same
directionas
we
may
infer
other
stars
in
space
beyond
the
farthest
that
we
know
of
they
convey
utterly
selfdestructive
ideas
which
can
have
no
real
meaning
and
can
only
be
thought
to
have
a
meaning
by
ignorant
and
uncultivated
people
otherwise
such
foundation
as
human
reason
rests
uponthat
is
to
say
the
current
opinion
of
those
whom
the
world
appraises
as
reasonable
and
agreeable
or
capable
of
being
agreed
with
for
any
timeis
sapped
the
whole
thing
tumbles
down
and
we
may
have
square
circles
and
round
triangles
which
may
be
declared
to
be
no
longer
absurdities
and
contradictions
in
terms
but
mysteries
that
go
beyond
our
reason
without
being
contrary
to
it
few
will
maintain
this
and
those
few
may
be
neglected
an
impersonal
person
must
therefore
be
admitted
to
be
nonsense
and
an
immaterial
god
to
be
atheism
in
another
shape
on
the
other
hand
if
god
is
of
a
reasonable
soul
and
human
flesh
subsisting
and
if
he
thus
has
the
body
without
which
he
isas
far
as
we
are
concernednonexistent
this
body
must
yet
be
reasonably
like
other
bodies
and
must
exist
in
some
place
and
at
some
time
furthermore
it
must
do
sufficiently
nearly
what
all
other
human
flesh
belonging
to
perfect
man
must
do
or
cease
to
be
human
flesh
our
ideas
are
like
our
organisms
they
have
some
little
elasticity
and
circumstancesuiting
power
some
little
margin
on
which
as
i
have
elsewhere
said
sidenotes
may
be
written
and
glosses
on
the
original
text
but
this
power
is
very
limited
as
offspring
will
only
as
a
general
rule
vary
very
little
from
its
immediate
parents
and
as
it
will
fail
either
immediately
or
in
the
second
generation
if
the
parents
differ
too
widely
from
one
another
so
we
cannot
get
our
idea
ofwe
will
say
a
horseto
conjure
up
to
our
minds
the
idea
of
any
animal
more
unlike
a
horse
than
a
pony
is
nor
can
we
get
a
welldefined
idea
of
a
combination
between
a
horse
and
any
animal
more
remote
from
it
than
an
ass
zebra
or
giraffe
we
may
indeed
make
a
statue
of
a
flying
horse
but
the
idea
is
one
which
cannot
be
made
plausible
to
any
but
ignorant
people
so
human
flesh
may
vary
a
little
from
human
flesh
without
undue
violence
being
done
to
our
reason
and
to
the
right
use
of
language
but
it
cannot
differ
from
it
so
much
as
not
to
eat
drink
nor
waste
and
repair
itself
human
flesh
which
is
without
these
necessary
adjuncts
is
human
flesh
only
to
those
who
can
believe
in
flying
horses
with
feathered
wings
and
bills
like
birdsthat
is
to
say
to
vulgar
and
superstitious
persons
lastly
not
only
must
the
perfect
man
who
is
the
second
person
of
the
godhead
according
to
the
orthodox
faith
and
who
subsists
of
human
flesh
as
well
as
of
a
reasonable
soul
not
only
must
this
person
exist
but
he
must
exist
in
some
place
either
on
this
earth
or
outside
it
if
he
exists
on
earth
he
must
be
in
europe
asia
africa
america
or
on
some
island
and
if
he
were
met
with
he
must
be
capable
of
being
seen
and
handled
in
the
same
way
as
all
other
things
that
can
be
called
perfect
man
are
seen
otherwise
he
is
a
perfect
man
who
is
not
only
not
a
perfect
man
but
who
does
not
in
any
considerable
degree
resemble
one
it
is
not
however
pretended
by
anyone
that
god
the
perfect
man
is
to
be
looked
for
in
any
place
upon
the
surface
of
the
globe
if
on
the
other
hand
the
person
of
god
exists
in
some
sphere
outside
the
earth
his
human
flesh
again
proves
to
be
of
an
entirely
different
kind
from
all
other
human
flesh
for
we
know
that
such
flesh
cannot
exist
except
on
earth
if
in
space
unsupported
it
must
fall
to
the
ground
or
into
some
other
planet
or
into
a
sun
or
go
on
revolving
round
the
earth
or
some
other
heavenly
bodyor
not
be
personal
none
of
those
whose
opinions
will
carry
weight
will
assign
a
position
either
in
some
country
on
this
earth
or
yet
again
in
space
to
jesus
christ
but
this
involves
the
rendering
meaningless
of
all
expressions
which
involve
his
personality
the
christian
conception
therefore
of
the
deity
proves
when
examined
with
any
desire
to
understand
our
own
meaning
and
what
lawlessness
so
great
as
the
attempt
to
impose
words
upon
our
understandings
which
have
no
lawful
settlement
within
them
to
be
no
less
a
contradiction
in
terms
than
the
pantheistic
conception
it
is
atheistic
as
offering
us
a
god
which
is
not
a
god
inasmuch
as
we
can
conceive
of
no
such
being
nor
of
anything
in
the
least
like
it
it
is
like
pantheism
an
illusion
which
can
be
believed
only
by
those
who
repeat
a
formula
which
they
have
learnt
by
heart
in
a
foreign
language
of
which
they
understand
nothing
and
yet
aver
that
they
believe
it
there
are
doubtless
many
who
will
say
that
this
is
possible
but
the
majority
of
my
readers
will
hold
that
no
proposition
can
be
believed
or
disbelieved
until
its
nature
is
understood
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
there
is
another
conception
of
god
possible
and
that
we
may
see
him
as
personal
without
at
the
same
time
believing
that
he
has
any
actual
tangible
existence
thus
we
personify
hope
truth
and
justice
without
intending
to
convey
to
anyone
the
impression
that
these
qualities
are
women
with
flesh
and
blood
again
we
do
not
think
of
nature
as
an
actual
woman
though
we
call
her
one
why
may
we
not
conceive
of
god
then
as
an
expression
whereby
we
personify
by
a
figure
of
speech
only
the
thing
that
is
intended
being
no
person
but
our
own
highest
ideal
of
power
wisdom
and
duration
there
would
be
no
reason
to
complain
of
this
if
this
manner
of
using
the
word
god
were
well
understood
many
words
have
two
meanings
or
even
three
without
any
mischievous
confusion
of
thought
following
there
can
not
only
be
no
objection
to
the
use
of
the
word
god
as
a
manner
of
expressing
the
highest
ideal
of
which
our
minds
can
conceive
but
on
the
contrary
no
better
expression
can
be
found
and
it
is
a
pity
the
word
is
not
thus
more
generally
used
few
however
would
be
content
with
any
such
limitation
of
god
as
that
he
should
be
an
idea
only
an
expression
for
certain
qualities
of
human
thought
and
action
whence
it
may
be
fairly
asked
did
our
deeply
rooted
belief
in
god
as
a
living
person
originate
the
idea
of
him
as
of
an
inconceivably
vast
ancient
powerful
loving
and
yet
formidable
person
is
one
which
survives
all
changes
of
detail
in
mens
opinion
i
believe
there
are
a
few
very
savage
tribes
who
are
as
absolutely
without
religious
sense
as
the
beasts
of
the
field
but
the
vast
majority
for
a
long
time
past
have
been
possessed
with
an
idea
that
there
is
somewhere
a
living
god
who
is
the
spirit
and
the
life
of
all
that
is
and
who
is
a
true
person
with
an
individuality
and
selfconsciousness
of
his
own
it
is
only
natural
that
we
should
be
asked
how
such
an
idea
has
remained
in
the
minds
of
so
manywho
differ
upon
almost
every
other
part
of
their
philosophyfor
so
long
a
time
if
it
was
without
foundation
and
a
piece
of
dreamy
mysticism
only
true
it
has
generally
been
declared
that
this
god
is
an
infinite
god
and
an
infinite
god
is
a
god
without
any
bounds
or
limitations
and
a
god
without
bounds
or
limitations
is
an
impersonal
god
and
an
impersonal
god
is
atheism
but
may
not
this
be
the
incoherency
of
prophecy
which
precedes
the
successful
mastering
of
an
idea
may
we
not
think
of
this
illusory
expression
as
having
arisen
from
inability
to
see
the
whereabouts
of
a
certain
vast
but
tangible
person
as
to
whose
existence
men
were
nevertheless
clear
if
they
felt
that
it
existed
and
yet
could
not
say
where
nor
wherein
it
was
to
be
laid
hands
on
they
would
be
very
likely
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
by
saying
that
it
existed
as
an
infinite
spirit
partly
from
a
desire
to
magnify
what
they
felt
must
be
so
vast
and
powerful
and
partly
because
they
had
as
yet
only
a
vague
conception
of
what
they
were
aiming
at
and
must
therefore
best
express
it
vaguely
we
must
not
be
surprised
that
when
an
idea
is
still
inchoate
its
expression
should
be
inconsistent
and
imperfectideas
will
almost
always
during
the
earlier
history
of
a
thought
be
put
together
experimentally
so
as
to
see
whether
or
no
they
will
cohere
partly
out
of
indolence
partly
out
of
the
desire
of
those
who
brought
the
ideas
together
to
be
declared
right
and
partly
out
of
joy
that
the
truth
should
be
supposed
found
incoherent
ideas
will
be
kept
together
longer
than
they
should
be
nevertheless
they
will
in
the
end
detach
themselves
and
go
if
others
present
themselves
which
fit
into
their
place
better
there
is
no
consistency
which
has
not
once
been
inconsistent
nor
coherency
that
has
not
been
incoherent
the
incoherency
of
our
ideas
concerning
god
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
have
not
yet
truly
found
him
but
it
does
not
argue
that
he
does
not
exist
and
cannot
be
found
anywhere
after
more
diligent
search
on
the
contrary
the
persistence
of
the
main
idea
in
spite
of
the
incoherency
of
its
details
points
strongly
in
the
direction
of
believing
that
it
rests
upon
a
foundation
in
fact
but
it
must
be
remembered
there
can
be
no
god
who
is
not
personal
and
material
and
if
personal
then
though
inconceivably
vast
in
comparison
with
man
still
limited
in
space
and
time
and
capable
of
making
mistakes
concerning
his
own
interests
though
as
a
general
rule
right
in
his
estimates
concerning
them
where
then
is
this
being
he
must
be
on
earth
or
what
folly
can
be
greater
than
speaking
of
him
as
a
person
what
are
persons
on
any
other
earth
to
us
or
we
to
them
he
must
have
existed
and
be
going
to
exist
through
all
time
and
he
must
have
a
tangible
body
where
then
is
the
body
of
this
god
and
what
is
the
mystery
of
his
incarnation
it
will
be
my
business
to
show
this
in
the
following
chapter
chapter
vi
the
tree
of
life
atheism
denies
knowledge
of
a
god
of
any
kind
pantheism
and
theism
alike
profess
to
give
us
a
god
but
they
alike
fail
to
perform
what
they
have
promised
we
can
know
nothing
of
the
god
they
offer
us
for
not
even
do
they
themselves
profess
that
any
of
our
senses
can
be
cognisant
sic
of
him
they
tell
us
that
he
is
a
personal
god
but
that
he
has
no
material
person
this
is
disguised
atheism
what
we
want
is
a
personal
god
the
glory
of
whose
presence
can
be
made
in
part
evident
to
our
senses
though
what
we
can
realise
sic
is
less
than
nothing
in
comparison
with
what
we
must
leave
for
ever
unimagined
and
truly
such
a
god
is
not
far
from
every
one
of
us
for
if
we
survey
the
broader
and
deeper
currents
of
mens
thoughts
during
the
last
three
thousand
years
we
may
observe
two
great
and
steady
sets
as
having
carried
away
with
them
the
more
eligible
races
of
mankind
the
one
is
a
tendency
from
polytheism
to
monotheism
the
other
from
polytypism
to
monotypism
of
the
earliest
forms
of
lifeall
animal
and
vegetable
forms
having
at
length
come
to
be
regarded
as
differentiations
of
a
single
substanceto
wit
protoplasm
no
man
does
well
so
to
kick
against
the
pricks
as
to
set
himself
against
tendencies
of
such
depth
strength
and
permanence
as
this
if
he
is
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
dominant
opinion
of
his
own
and
of
many
past
ages
he
will
see
a
single
godimpregnate
substance
as
having
been
the
parent
from
which
all
living
forms
have
sprung
one
spirit
and
one
form
capable
of
such
modification
as
its
directing
spirit
shall
think
fit
one
soul
and
one
body
one
god
and
one
life
for
the
time
has
come
when
the
two
unities
so
painfully
arrived
at
must
be
joined
together
as
body
and
soul
and
be
seen
not
as
two
but
one
there
is
no
living
organism
untenanted
by
the
spirit
of
god
nor
any
spirit
of
god
perceivable
by
man
apart
from
organism
embodying
and
expressing
it
god
and
the
life
of
the
world
are
like
a
mountain
which
will
present
different
aspects
as
we
look
at
it
from
different
sides
but
which
when
we
have
gone
all
round
it
proves
to
be
one
only
god
is
the
animal
and
vegetable
world
and
the
animal
and
vegetable
world
is
god
i
have
repeatedly
said
that
we
ought
to
see
all
animal
and
vegetable
life
as
uniting
to
form
a
single
personality
i
should
perhaps
explain
this
more
fully
for
the
idea
of
a
compound
person
is
one
which
at
first
is
not
very
easy
to
grasp
inasmuch
as
we
are
not
conscious
of
any
but
our
more
superficial
aspects
and
have
therefore
until
lately
failed
to
understand
that
we
are
ourselves
compound
persons
i
may
perhaps
be
allowed
to
quote
from
an
earlier
work
each
cell
in
the
human
body
is
now
admitted
by
physiologists
to
be
a
person
with
an
intelligent
soul
differing
from
our
own
more
complex
soul
in
degree
and
not
in
kind
and
like
ourselves
being
born
living
and
dying
it
would
appear
then
as
though
we
our
souls
or
selves
or
personalities
or
by
whatever
name
we
may
prefer
to
be
called
are
but
the
consensus
and
fullflowing
stream
of
countless
sensations
and
impulses
on
the
part
of
our
tributary
souls
or
selves
who
probably
no
more
know
that
we
exist
and
that
they
exist
as
a
part
of
us
than
a
microscopic
insect
knows
the
results
of
spectrum
analysis
or
than
an
agricultural
labourer
sic
knows
the
working
of
the
british
constitution
and
of
whom
we
know
no
more
than
we
do
of
the
habits
and
feelings
of
some
class
widely
separated
from
our
ownlife
and
habit
p
after
which
it
became
natural
to
ask
the
following
questionis
it
possible
to
avoid
imagining
that
we
may
be
ourselves
atoms
undesignedly
combining
to
form
some
vaster
being
though
we
are
utterly
incapable
of
perceiving
this
being
as
a
single
individual
or
of
realising
sic
the
scheme
and
scope
of
our
own
combination
and
this
too
not
a
spiritual
being
which
without
matter
or
what
we
think
matter
of
some
sort
is
as
complete
nonsense
to
us
as
though
men
bade
us
love
and
lean
upon
an
intelligent
vacuum
but
a
being
with
what
is
virtually
flesh
and
blood
and
bones
with
organs
senses
dimensions
in
some
way
analogous
to
our
own
into
some
other
part
of
which
being
at
the
time
of
our
great
change
we
must
infallibly
reenter
starting
clean
anew
with
bygones
bygones
and
no
more
ache
for
ever
from
age
or
antecedents
an
organic
being
writes
mr
darwin
is
a
microcosm
a
little
universe
formed
of
a
host
of
selfpropagating
organisms
inconceivably
minute
and
numerous
as
the
stars
in
heaven
as
these
myriads
of
smaller
organisms
are
parts
and
processes
of
us
so
are
we
parts
and
processes
of
life
at
large
a
tree
is
composed
of
a
multitude
of
subordinate
trees
each
bud
being
a
distinct
individual
so
coral
polypes
sic
form
a
treelike
growth
of
animal
life
with
branches
from
which
spring
individual
polypes
sic
that
are
connected
by
a
common
tissue
and
supported
by
a
common
skeleton
we
have
no
difficulty
in
seeing
a
unity
in
multitude
and
a
multitude
in
unity
here
because
we
can
observe
the
wood
and
the
gelatinous
tissue
connecting
together
all
the
individuals
which
compose
either
the
tree
or
the
mass
of
polypes
sic
yet
the
skeleton
whether
of
tree
or
of
polype
sic
is
inanimate
and
the
tissue
whether
of
bark
or
gelatine
sic
is
only
the
matted
roots
of
the
individual
buds
so
that
the
outward
and
striking
connection
between
the
individuals
is
more
delusive
than
real
the
true
connection
is
one
which
cannot
be
seen
and
consists
in
the
animation
of
each
bud
by
a
like
spiritin
the
community
of
soul
in
the
voice
of
the
lord
which
maketh
men
to
be
of
one
mind
in
an
houseto
dwell
together
in
unityto
take
what
are
practically
identical
views
of
things
and
express
themselves
in
concert
under
all
circumstances
provided
thisthe
true
unifier
of
organismcan
be
shown
to
exist
the
absence
of
gross
outward
and
visible
but
inanimate
common
skeleton
is
no
bar
to
oneness
of
personality
let
us
picture
to
our
minds
a
tree
of
which
all
the
woody
fibre
sic
shall
be
invisible
the
buds
and
leaves
seeming
to
stand
in
midair
unsupported
and
unconnected
with
one
another
so
that
there
is
nothing
but
a
certain
treelike
collocation
of
foliage
to
suggest
any
common
principle
of
growth
uniting
the
leaves
three
or
four
leaves
of
different
ages
stand
living
together
at
the
place
in
the
air
where
the
end
of
each
bough
should
be
of
these
the
youngest
are
still
tender
and
in
the
bud
while
the
older
ones
are
turning
yellow
and
on
the
point
of
falling
between
these
leaves
a
sort
of
twiglike
growth
can
be
detected
if
they
are
looked
at
in
certain
lights
but
it
is
hard
to
see
except
perhaps
when
a
bud
is
on
the
point
of
coming
out
then
there
does
appear
to
be
a
connection
which
might
be
called
branchlike
the
separate
tufts
are
very
different
from
one
another
so
that
oak
leaves
ash
leaves
horsechestnut
leaves
etc
are
each
represented
but
there
is
one
species
only
at
the
end
of
each
bough
though
the
trunk
and
all
the
inner
boughs
and
leaves
have
disappeared
yet
there
hang
here
and
there
fossil
leaves
also
in
midair
they
appear
to
have
been
petrified
without
method
or
selection
by
what
we
call
the
caprices
of
nature
they
hang
in
the
path
which
the
boughs
and
twigs
would
have
taken
and
they
seem
to
indicate
that
if
the
tree
could
have
been
seen
a
million
years
earlier
before
it
had
grown
near
its
present
size
the
leaves
standing
at
the
end
of
each
bough
would
have
been
found
very
different
from
what
they
are
now
let
us
suppose
that
all
the
leaves
at
the
end
of
all
the
invisible
boughs
no
matter
how
different
they
now
are
from
one
another
were
found
in
earliest
budhood
to
be
absolutely
indistinguishable
and
afterwards
to
develop
towards
each
differentiation
through
stages
which
were
indicated
by
the
fossil
leaves
lastly
let
us
suppose
that
though
the
boughs
which
seem
wanted
to
connect
all
the
living
forms
of
leaves
with
the
fossil
leaves
and
with
countless
forms
of
which
all
trace
has
disappeared
and
also
with
a
single
roothave
become
invisible
yet
that
there
is
irrefragable
evidence
to
show
that
they
once
actually
existed
and
indeed
are
existing
at
this
moment
in
a
condition
as
real
though
as
invisible
to
the
eye
as
air
or
electricity
should
we
i
ask
under
these
circumstances
hesitate
to
call
our
imaginary
plant
or
tree
by
a
single
name
and
to
think
of
it
as
one
person
merely
upon
the
score
that
the
woody
fibre
sic
was
invisible
should
we
not
esteem
the
common
soul
memories
and
principles
of
growth
which
are
preserved
between
all
the
buds
no
matter
how
widely
they
differ
in
detail
as
a
more
living
bond
of
union
than
a
framework
of
wood
would
be
which
though
it
were
visible
to
the
eye
would
still
be
inanimate
the
mistletoe
appears
as
closely
connected
with
the
tree
on
which
it
grows
as
any
of
the
buds
of
the
tree
itself
it
is
fed
upon
the
same
sap
as
the
other
buds
are
which
saphowever
much
it
may
modify
it
at
the
last
momentit
draws
through
the
same
fibres
sic
as
do
its
fosterbrotherswhy
then
do
we
at
once
feel
that
the
mistletoe
is
no
part
of
the
apple
tree
not
from
any
want
of
manifest
continuity
but
from
the
spiritual
differencefrom
the
profoundly
different
views
of
life
and
things
which
are
taken
by
the
parasite
and
the
tree
on
which
it
growsthe
two
are
now
different
because
they
think
differentlyas
long
as
they
thought
alike
they
were
alikethat
is
to
say
they
were
protoplasmthey
and
we
and
all
that
lives
meeting
in
this
common
substance
we
ought
therefore
to
regard
our
supposed
tufts
of
leaves
as
a
tree
that
is
to
say
as
a
compound
existence
each
one
of
whose
component
items
is
compounded
of
others
which
are
also
in
their
turn
compounded
but
the
tree
above
described
is
no
imaginary
parallel
to
the
condition
of
life
upon
the
globe
it
is
perhaps
as
accurate
a
description
of
the
tree
of
life
as
can
be
put
into
so
small
a
compass
the
most
sure
proof
of
a
mans
identity
is
the
power
to
remember
that
such
and
such
things
happened
which
none
but
he
can
know
the
most
sure
proof
of
his
remembering
is
the
power
to
react
his
part
in
the
original
drama
whatever
it
may
have
been
if
a
man
can
repeat
a
performance
with
consummate
truth
and
can
stand
any
amount
of
crossquestioning
about
it
he
is
the
performer
of
the
original
performance
whatever
it
was
the
memories
which
all
living
forms
prove
by
their
actions
that
they
possessthe
memories
of
their
common
identity
with
a
single
person
in
whom
they
meetthis
is
incontestable
proof
of
their
being
animated
by
a
common
soul
it
is
certain
therefore
that
all
living
forms
whether
animal
or
vegetable
are
in
reality
one
animal

and
the
mosses
being
part
of
the
same
vast
person
in
no
figurative
sense
but
with
as
much
bona
fide
literal
truth
as
when
we
say
that
a
mans
fingernails
and
his
eyes
are
parts
of
the
same
man
it
is
in
this
person
that
we
may
see
the
body
of
godand

the
evolution
of
this
person

mystery
of

chapter
v
butler
wrote
in
the
articles
above
alluded
to
god
the
known
and
god
the
unknown
i
separated
the
organic
from
the
inorganic
but
when
i
came
to
rewrite
them
i
found
that
this
could
not
be
done
and
that
i
must
reconstruct
what
i
had
written
this
reconstruction
never
having
been
effected
it
may
be
well
to
quote
further
from
unconscious
memory
concluding
chapter
at
parting
therefore
i
would
recommend
the
reader
to
see
every
atom
in
the
universe
as
living
and
able
to
feel
and
remember
but
in
a
humble
way
he
must
have
life
eternal
as
well
as
matter
eternal
and
the
life
and
the
matter
must
be
joined
together
inseparably
as
body
and
soul
to
one
another
thus
he
will
see
god
everywhere
not
as
those
who
repeat
phrases
conventionally
but
as
people
who
would
have
their
words
taken
according
to
their
most
natural
and
legitimate
meaning
and
he
will
feel
that
the
main
difference
between
him
and
many
of
those
who
oppose
him
lies
in
the
fact
that
whereas
both
he
and
they
use
the
same
language
his
opponents
only
half
mean
what
they
say
while
he
means
it
entirely
we
shall
endeavour
sic
to
see
the
socalled
inorganic
as
living
in
respect
of
the
qualities
it
has
in
common
with
the
organic
rather
than
the
organic
as
nonliving

respect
of
the
qualities
it

likeness
of
god
in
my
last
chapter
i
endeavoured
sic
to
show
that
each
living
being
whether
animal
or
plant
throughout
the
world
is
a
component
item
of
a
single
personality
in
the
same
way
as
each
individual
citizen
of
a
community
is
a
member
of
one
state
or
as
each
cell
of
our
own
bodies
is
a
separate
person
or
each
bud
of
a
tree
a
separate
plant
we
must
therefore
see
the
whole
varied
congeries
of
living
things
as
a
single
very
ancient
being
of
inconceivable
vastness
and
animated
by
one
spirit
we
call
the
octogenarian
one
person
with
the
embryo
of
a
few
days
old
from
which
he
has
developed
an
oak
or
yew
tree
may
be
two
thousand
years
old
but
we
call
it
one
plant
with
the
seed
from
which
it
has
grown
millions
of
individual
buds
have
come
and
gone
to
the
yearly
wasting
and
repairing
of
its
substance
but
the
tree
still
lives
and
thrives
and
the
dead
leaves
have
life
therein
so
the
tree
of
life
still
lives
and
thrives
as
a
single
person
no
matter
how
many
new
features
it
has
acquired
during
its
development
nor
again
how
many
of
its
individual
leaves
fall
yellow
to
the
ground
daily
the
spirit
or
soul
of
this
person
is
the
spirit
of
god
and
its
bodyfor
we
know
of
no
soul
or
spirit
without
a
body
nor
of
any
living
body
without
a
spirit
or
soul
and
if
there
is
a
god
at
all
there
must
be
a
body
of
godis
the
manymembered
outgrowth
of
protoplasm
the
ensemble
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
to
repeat
the
theologian
of
today
tells
us
that
there
is
a
god
but
is
horrified
at
the
idea
of
that
god
having
a
body
we
say
that
we
believe
in
god
but
that
our
minds
refuse
to
realise
sic
an
intelligent
being
who
has
no
bodily
person
where
then
says
the
theologian
is
the
body
of
your
god
we
have
answered
in
the
living
forms
upon
the
earth
which
though
they
look
many
are
when
we
regard
them
by
the
light
of
their
history
and
of
true
analogies
one
person
only
the
spiritual
connection
between
them
is
a
more
real
bond
of
union
than
the
visible
discontinuity
of
material
parts
is
ground
for
separating
them
in
our
thoughts
let
the
reader
look
at
a
case
of
moths
in
the
shopwindow
of
a
naturalist
and
note
the
unspeakable
delicacy
beauty
and
yet
serviceableness
of
their
wings
or
let
him
look
at
a
case
of
hummingbirds
and
remember
how
infinitely
small
a
part
of
nature
is
the
whole
group
of
the
animals
he
may
be
considering
and
how
infinitely
small
a
part
of
that
group
is
the
case
that
he
is
looking
at
let
him
bear
in
mind
that
he
is
looking
on
the
dead
husks
only
of
what
was
inconceivably
more
marvellous
sic
when
the
moths
or
hummingbirds
were
alive
let
him
think
of
the
vastness
of
the
earth
and
of
the
activity
by
day
and
night
through
countless
ages
of
such
countless
forms
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
as
that
no
human
mind
can
form
the
faintest
approach
to
anything
that
can
be
called
a
conception
of
their
multitude
and
let
him
remember
that
all
these
forms
have
touched
and
touched
and
touched
other
living
beings
till
they
meet
back
on
a
common
substance
in
which
they
are
rooted
and
from
which
they
all
branch
forth
so
as
to
be
one
animal
will
he
not
in
this
real
and
tangible
existence
find
a
god
who
is
as
much
more
worthy
of
admiration
than
the
god
of
the
ordinary
theologianas
he
is
also
more
easy
of
comprehension
for
the
theologian
dreams
of
a
god
sitting
above
the
clouds
among
the
cherubim
who
blow
their
loud
uplifted
angel
trumpets
before
him
and
humour
sic
him
as
though
he
were
some
despot
in
an
oriental
tale
but
we
enthrone
him
upon
the
wings
of
birds
on
the
petals
of
flowers
on
the
faces
of
our
friends
and
upon
whatever
we
most
delight
in
of
all
that
lives
upon
the
earth
we
then
can
not
only
love
him
but
we
can
do
that
without
which
love
has
neither
power
nor
sweetness
but
is
a
phantom
only
an
impersonal
person
a
vain
stretching
forth
of
arms
towards
something
that
can
never
fill
themwe
can
express
our
love
and
have
it
expressed
to
us
in
return
and
this
not
in
the
uprearing
of
stone
templesfor
the
lord
dwelleth
sic
in
temples
made
with
other
organs
than
handsnor
yet
in
the
cleansing
of
our
hearts
but
in
the
caress
bestowed
upon
horse
and
dog
and
kisses
upon
the
lips
of
those
we
love
wide
however
as
is
the
difference
between
the
orthodox
theologian
and
ourselves
it
is
not
more
remarkable
than
the
number
of
the
points
on
which
we
can
agree
with
him
and
on
which
moreover
we
can
make
his
meaning
clearer
to
himself
than
it
can
have
ever
hitherto
been
he
for
example
says
that
man
has
been
made
in
the
image
of
god
but
he
cannot
mean
what
he
says
unless
his
god
has
a
material
body
we
on
the
other
hand
do
not
indeed
believe
that
the
body
of
godthe
incorporation
of
all
lifeis
like
the
body
of
a
man
more
than
we
believe
each
one
of
our
own
cells
or
subordinate
personalities
to
be
like
a
man
in
miniature
but
we
nevertheless
hold
that
each
of
our
tributary
selves
is
so
far
made
after
the
likeness
of
the
body
corporate
that
it
possesses
all
our
main
and
essential
characteristicsthat
is
to
say
that
it
can
waste
and
repair
itself
can
feel
move
and
remember
to
this
extent
also
wewho
stand
in
mean
proportional
between
our
tributary
personalities
and
godare
made
in
the
likeness
of
god
for
we
and
god
and
our
subordinate
cells
alike
possess
the
essential
characteristics
of
life
which
have
been
above
recited
it
is
more
true
therefore
for
us
to
say
that
we
are
made
in
the
likeness
of
god
than
for
the
orthodox
theologian
to
do
so
nor
again
do
we
find
difficulty
in
adopting
such
an
expression
as
that
god
has
taken
our
nature
upon
him
we
hold
this
as
firmly
and
much
more
so
than
christians
can
do
but
we
say
that
this
is
no
new
thing
for
him
to
do
for
that
he
has
taken
flesh
and
dwelt
among
us
from
the
day
that
he
first
assumed
our
shape
some
millions
of
years
ago
until
now
god
cannot
become
man
more
especially
than
he
can
become
other
living
forms
any
more
than
we
can
be
our
eyes
more
especially
than
any
other
of
our
organs
we
may
develop
larger
eyes
so
that
our
eyes
may
come
to
occupy
a
still
more
important
place
in
our
economy
than
they
do
at
present
and
in
a
similar
way
the
human
race
may
become
a
more
predominant
part
of
god
than
it
now
isbut
we
cannot
admit
that
one
living
form
is
more
like
god
than
another
we
must
hold
all
equally
like
him
inasmuch
as
they
keep
ever
as
buffon
says
the
same
fundamental
unity
in
spite
of
differences
of
detailnutrition
development
reproduction
and
i
would
add
memory
being
the
common
traits
of
all
organic
bodies
the
utmost
we
can
admit
is
that
some
embodiments
of
the
spirit
of
life
may
be
more
important
than
others
to
the
welfare
of
life
as
a
whole
in
the
same
way
as
some
of
our
organs
are
more
important
than
others
to
ourselves
but
the
above
resemblances
between
the
language
which
we
can
adopt
intelligently
and
that
which
theologians
use
vaguely
seem
to
reduce
the
differences
of
opinion
between
the
two
contending
parties
to
disputes
about
detail
for
even
those
who
believe
their
ideas
to
be
the
most
definite
and
who
picture
to
themselves
a
god
as
anthropomorphic
as
he
was
represented
by
raffaelle
are
yet
not
prepared
to
stand
by
their
ideas
if
they
are
hard
pressed
in
the
same
way
as
we
are
by
ours
those
who
say
that
god
became
man
and
took
flesh
upon
him
and
that
he
is
now
perfect
god
and
perfect
man
of
a
reasonable
soul
and
human
flesh
subsisting
will
yet
not
mean
that
christ
has
a
heart
blood
a
stomach
etc
like
mans
which
if
he
has
not
it
is
idle
to
speak
of
him
as
perfect
man
i
am
persuaded
that
they
do
not
mean
this
nor
wish
to
mean
it
but
that
they
have
been
led
into
saying
it
by
a
series
of
steps
which
it
is
very
easy
to
understand
and
sympathise
sic
with
if
they
are
considered
with
any
diligence
for
our
forefathers
though
they
might
and
did
feel
the
existence
of
a
personal
god
in
the
world
yet
could
not
demonstrate
this
existence
and
made
mistakes
in
their
endeavour
sic
to
persuade
themselves
that
they
understood
thoroughly
a
truth
which
they
had
as
yet
perceived
only
from
a
long
distance
hence
all
the
dogmatism
and
theology
of
many
centuries
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
form
a
clear
or
definite
conception
concerning
god
until
they
had
studied
his
works
more
deeply
so
as
to
grasp
the
idea
of
many
animals
of
different
kinds
and
with
no
apparent
connection
between
them
being
yet
truly
parts
of
one
and
the
same
animal
which
comprised
them
in
the
same
way
as
a
tree
comprises
all
its
buds
they
might
speak
of
this
by
a
figure
of
speech
but
they
could
not
see
it
as
a
fact
before
this
could
be
intended
literally
evolution
must
be
grasped
and
not
evolution
as
taught
in
what
is
now
commonly
called
darwinism
but
the
old
teleological
darwinism
of
eighty
years
ago
nor
is
this
again
sufficient
for
it
must
be
supplemented
by
a
perception
of
the
oneness
of
personality
between
parents
and
offspring
the
persistence
of
memory
through
all
generations
the
latency
of
this
memory
until
rekindled
by
the
recurrence
of
the
associated
ideas
and
the
unconsciousness
with
which
repeated
acts
come
to
be
performed
these
are
modern
ideas
which
might
be
caught
sight
of
now
and
again
by
prophets
in
time
past
but
which
are
even
now
mastered
and
held
firmly
only
by
the
few
when
once
however
these
ideas
have
been
accepted
the
chief
difference
between
the
orthodox
god
and
the
god
who
can
be
seen
of
all
men
is
that
the
first
is
supposed
to
have
existed
from
all
time
while
the
second
has
only
lived
for
more
millions
of
years
than
our
minds
can
reckon
intelligently
the
first
is
omnipresent
in
all
space
while
the
second
is
only
present
in
the
living
forms
upon
this
earththat
is
to
say
is
only
more
widely
present
than
our
minds
can
intelligently
embrace
the
first
is
omnipotent
and
allwise
the
second
is
only
quasiomnipotent
and
quasi
allwise
it
is
true
then
that
we
deprive
god
of
that
infinity
which
orthodox
theologians
have
ascribed
to
him
but
the
bounds
we
leave
him
are
of
such
incalculable
extent
that
nothing
can
be
imagined
more
glorious
or
vaster
and
in
return
for
the
limitations
we
have
assigned
to
him
we
render
it
possible
for
men
to
believe
in
him
and
love
him
not
with
their
lips
only
but
with
their
hearts
and
lives
which
i
may
now
venture
to
ask
my
readers
is
the
true
godthe
god
of
the
theologian
or
he
whom
we
may
see
around
us
and
in
whose
presence
we
stand
each
hour
and
moment
of
our
lives
chapter
viii
the
life
everlasting
let
us
now
consider
the
life
which
we
can
look
forward
to
with
certainty
after
death
and
the
moral
government
of
the
world
here
on
earth
if
we
could
hear
the
leaves
complaining
to
one
another
that
they
must
die
and
commiserating
the
hardness
of
their
lot
in
having
ever
been
induced
to
bud
forth
we
should
i
imagine
despise
them
for
their
peevishness
more
than
we
should
pity
them
we
should
tell
them
that
though
we
could
not
see
reason
for
thinking
that
they
would
ever
hang
again
upon
the
sameor
any
at
all
similarbough
as
the
same
individual
leaves
after
they
had
once
faded
and
fallen
off
yet
that
as
they
had
been
changing
personalities
without
feeling
it
during
the
whole
of
their
leafhood
so
they
would
on
death
continue
to
do
this
selfsame
thing
by
entering
into
new
phases
of
life
true
death
will
deprive
them
of
conscious
memory
concerning
their
now
current
life
but
though
they
die
as
leaves
they
live
in
the
tree
whom
they
have
helped
to
vivify
and
whose
growth
and
continued
wellbeing
is
due
solely
to
this
life
and
death
of
its
component
personalities
we
consider
the
cells
which
are
born
and
die
within
us
yearly
to
have
been
sufficiently
honoured
sic
in
having
contributed
their
quotum
to
our
life
why
should
we
have
such
difficulty
in
seeing
that
a
healthy
enjoyment
and
employment
of
our
life
will
give
us
a
sufficient
reward
in
that
growth
of
god
wherein
we
may
live
more
truly
and
effectually
after
death
than
we
have
lived
when
we
were
conscious
of
existence
is
handel
dead
when
he
influences
and
sets
in
motion
more
human
beings
in
three
months
now
than
during
the
whole
probably
of
the
years
in
which
he
thought
that
he
was
alive
what
is
being
alive
if
the
power
to
draw
men
for
many
miles
in
order
that
they
may
put
themselves
en
rapport
with
him
is
not
being
so
true
handel
no
longer
knows
the
power
which
he
has
over
us
but
this
is
a
small
matter
he
no
longer
animates
six
feet
of
flesh
and
blood
but
he
lives
in
us
as
the
dead
leaf
lives
in
the
tree
he
is
with
god
and
god
knows
him
though
he
knows
himself
no
more
this
should
suffice
and
i
observe
in
practice
does
suffice
for
all
reasonable
persons
it
may
be
said
that
one
day
the
tree
itself
must
die
and
the
leaves
no
longer
live
therein
and
so
also
that
the
very
god
or
life
of
the
world
will
one
day
perish
as
all
that
is
born
must
surely
in
the
end
die
but
they
who
fret
upon
such
grounds
as
this
must
be
in
so
much
want
of
a
grievance
that
it
were
a
cruelty
to
rob
them
of
one
if
a
man
who
is
fond
of
music
tortures
himself
on
the
ground
that
one
day
all
possible
combinations
and
permutations
of
sounds
will
have
been
exhausted
so
that
there
can
be
no
more
new
tunes
the
only
thing
we
can
do
with
him
is
to
pity
him
and
leave
him
nor
is
there
any
better
course
than
this
to
take
with
those
idle
people
who
worry
themselves
and
others
on
the
score
that
they
will
one
day
be
unable
to
remember
the
small
balance
of
their
lives
that
they
have
not
already
forgotten
as
unimportant
to
themthat
they
will
one
day
die
to
the
balance
of
what
they
have
not
already
died
to
i
never
knew
a
wellbred
or
amiable
person
who
complained
seriously
of
the
fact
that
he
would
have
to
die
granted
we
must
all
sometimes
find
ourselves
feeling
sorry
that
we
cannot
remain
for
ever
at
our
present
age
and
that
we
may
die
so
much
sooner
than
we
like
but
these
regrets
are
passing
with
welldisposed
people
and
are
a
sine
qua
non
for
the
existence
of
life
at
all
for
if
people
could
live
for
ever
so
as
to
suffer
from
no
such
regret
there
would
be
no
growth
nor
development
in
life
if
on
the
other
hand
there
were
no
unwillingness
to
die
people
would
commit
suicide
upon
the
smallest
contradiction
and
the
race
would
end
in
a
twelvemonth
we
then
offer
immortality
but
we
do
not
offer
resurrection
from
the
dead
we
say
that
those
who
die
live
in
the
lord
whether
they
be
just
or
unjust
and
that
the
present
growth
of
god
is
the
outcome
of
all
past
lives
but
we
believe
that
as
they
live
in
godin
the
effect
they
have
produced
upon
the
universal
lifewhen
once
their
individual
life
is
ended
so
it
is
god
who
knows
of
their
life
thenceforward
and
not
themselves
and
we
urge
that
this
immortality
this
entrance
into
the
joy
of
the
lord
this
being
ever
with
god
is
true
and
can
be
apprehended
by
all
men
and
that
the
perception
of
it
should
and
will
tend
to
make
them
lead
happier
healthier
lives
whereas
the
commonly
received
opinion
is
true
with
a
stage
truth
only
and
has
little
permanent
effect
upon
those
who
are
best
worth
considering
nevertheless
the
expressions
in
common
use
among
the
orthodox
fit
in
so
perfectly
with
facts
which
we
must
all
acknowledge
that
it
is
impossible
not
to
regard
the
expressions
as
founded
upon
a
prophetic
perception
of
the
facts
two
things
stand
out
with
sufficient
clearness
the
first
is
the
rarity
of
suicide
even
among
those
who
rail
at
life
most
bitterly
the
other
is
the
little
eagerness
with
which
those
who
cry
out
most
loudly
for
a
resurrection
desire
to
begin
their
new
life
when
comforting
a
husband
upon
the
loss
of
his
wife
we
do
not
tell
him
we
hope
he
will
soon
join
her
but
we
should
certainly
do
this
if
we
could
even
pretend
we
thought
the
husband
would
like
it
i
can
never
remember
having
felt
or
witnessed
any
pain
bodily
or
mental
which
would
have
made
me
or
anyone
else
receive
a
suggestion
that
we
had
better
commit
suicide
without
indignantly
asking
how
our
adviser
would
like
to
commit
suicide
himself
yet
there
are
so
many
and
such
easy
ways
of
dying
that
indignation
at
being
advised
to
commit
suicide
arises
more
from
enjoyment
of
life
than
from
fear
of
the
mere
physical
pain
of
dying
granted
that
there
is
much
deplorable
pain
in
the
world
from
illhealth
loss
of
money
loss
of
reputation
misconduct
of
those
nearest
to
us
or
what
not
and
granted
that
in
some
cases
these
causes
do
drive
men
to
actual
selfdestruction
yet
suffering
such
as
this
happens
to
a
comparatively
small
number
and
occupies
comparatively
a
small
space
in
the
lives
of
those
to
whom
it
does
happen
what
however
have
we
to
say
to
those
cases
in
which
suffering
and
injustice
are
inflicted
upon
defenceless
sic
people
for
years
and
years
so
that
the
iron
enters
into
their
souls
and
they
have
no
avenger
can
we
give
any
comfort
to
such
sufferers
and
if
not
is
our
religion
any
better
than
a
mockerya
filling
the
rich
with
good
things
and
sending
the
hungry
empty
away
can
we
tell
them
when
they
are
oppressed
with
burdens
yet
that
their
cry
will
come
up
to
god
and
be
heard
the
question
suggests
its
own
answer
for
assuredly
our
god
knows
our
innermost
secrets
there
is
not
a
word
in
our
hearts
but
he
knoweth
it
altogether
he
knoweth
our
downsitting
and
our
uprising
he
is
about
our
path
and
about
our
bed
and
spieth
out
all
our
ways
he
has
fashioned
us
behind
and
before
and
we
cannot
attain
such
knowledge
for
like
all
knowledge
when
it
has
become
perfect
it
is
too
excellent
for
us
whither
then
says
david
shall
i
go
from
thy
spirit
or
whither
shall
i
go
then
from
thy
presence
if
i
climb
up
into
heaven
thou
art
there
if
i
go
down
into
hell
thou
art
there
also
if
i
take
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
remain
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea
even
there
also
shall
thy
hand
lead
me
and
thy
right
hand
shall
hold
me
if
i
say
peradventure
the
darkness
shall
cover
me
then
shall
my
night
be
turned
into
day
the
darkness
and
light
to
thee
are
both
alike
for
my
reins
are
thine
thou
hast
covered
me
in
my
mothers
womb
my
bones
are
not
hid
from
thee
though
i
be
made
secretly
and
fashioned
beneath
in
the
earth
thine
eyes
did
see
my
substance
yet
being
unperfect
and
in
thy
book
were
all
my
members
written
which
day
by

were
fashioned
when
as
yet
there
was
none
of
them

i
not
hate
them
o
lord
that
hate
thee
and
am
i
not
grieved
with
them
that
rise
up
against
thee
yea
i
hate
them
right

psalm
cxxxix
there
is
not
a
word
of
this
which
we
cannot
endorse
with
more
significance
as
well
as
with
greater
heartiness
than
those
can
who
look
upon
god
as
he
is
commonly
represented
to
them
whatever
comfort
therefore
those
in
distress
have
been
in
the
habit
of
receiving
from
these
and
kindred
passages
we
intensify
rather
than
not
we
cannot
alas
make
pain
cease
to
be
pain
nor
injustice
easy
to
bear
but
we
can
show
that
no
pain
is
bootless
and
that
there
is
a
tendency
in
all
injustice
to
right
itself
suffering
is
not
inflicted
wilfully
sic
as
it
were
by
a
magician
who
could
have
averted
it
nor
is
it
vain
in
its
results
but
unless
we
are
cut
off
from
god
by
having
dwelt
in
some
place
where
none
of
our
kind
can
know
of
what
has
happened
to
us
it
will
move
gods
heart
to
redress
our
grievance
and
will
tend
to
the
happiness
of
those
who
come
after
us
even
if
not
to
our
own
the
moral
government
of
god
over
the
world
is
exercised
through
us
who
are
his
ministers
and
persons
and
a
government
of
this
description
is
the
only
one
which
can
be
observed
as
practically
influencing
mens
conduct
god

those
who
help
themselves

in
helping
themselves
they
are

the

what
we
instinctively
turn

when
we

whether

of
conduct
is
right

wrong

so
paul
clenches
his

of

things

falls
back
upon
an
appeal
to
the
educated
conscience
of
his
age
certainly
the
wicked
do
sometimes
appear
to
escape
punishment
but
it
must
be
remembered
there
are
punishments
from
within
which
do
not
meet
the
eye
if
these
fall
on
a
man
he
is
sufficiently
punished
if
they
do
not
fall
on
him
it
is
probable
we
have
been
over
hasty
in
assuming
that

is

chapter
ix
god
the
unknown
the
reader
will
already
have
felt
that
the
panzoistic
conception
of
godthe
conception
that
is
to
say
of
god
as
comprising
all
living
units
in
his
own
single
persondoes
not
help
us
to
understand
the
origin
of
matter
nor
yet
that
of
the
primordial
cell
which
has
grown
and
unfolded
itself
into
the
present
life
of
the
world
how
was
the
world
rendered
fit
for
the
habitation
of
the
first
germ
of
life
how
came
it
to
have
air
and
water
without
which
nothing
that
we
know
of
as
living
can
exist
was
the
world
fashioned
and
furnished
with
aqueous
and
atmospheric
adjuncts
with
a
view
to
the
requirements
of
the
infant
monad
and
to
his
due
development
if
so
we
have
evidence
of
design
and
if
so
of
a
designer
and
if
so
there
must
be
some
far
vaster
person
who
looms
out
behind
our
god
and
who
stands
in
the
same
relation
to
him
as
he
to
us
and
behind
this
vaster
and
more
unknown
god
there
may
be
yet
another
and
another
and
another
it
is
certain
that
life
did
not
make
the
world
with
a
view
to
its
own
future
requirements
for
the
world
was
at
one
time
red
hot
and
there
can
have
been
no
living
being
upon
it
nor
is
it
conceivable
that
matter
in
which
there
was
no
lifeinasmuch
as
it
was
infinitely
hotter
than
the
hottest
infusion
which
any
living
germ
can
supportcould
gradually
come
to
be
alive
without
impregnation
from
a
living
parent
all
living
things
that
we
know
of
have
come
from
other
living
things
with
bodies
and
souls
whose
existence
can
be
satisfactorily
established
in
spite
of
their
being
often
too
small
for
our
detection
since
then
the
world
was
once
without
life
and
since
no
analogy
points
in
the
direction
of
thinking
that
life
can
spring
up
spontaneously
we
are
driven
to
suppose
that
it
was
introduced
into
this
world
from
some
other
source
extraneous
to
it
altogether
and
if
so
we
find
ourselves
irresistibly
drawn
to
the
inquiry
whether
the
source
of
the
life
that
is
in
the
worldthe
impregnator
of
this
earthmay
not
also
have
prepared
the
earth
for
the
reception
of
his
offspring
as
a
hen
makes
an
eggshell
or
a
peach
a
stone
for
the
protection
of
the
germ
within
it
not
only
are
we
drawn
to
the
inquiry
but
we
are
drawn
also
to
the
answer
that
the
earth
was
so
prepared
designedly
by
a
person
with
body
and
soul
who
knew
beforehand
the
kind
of
thing
he
required
and
who
took
the
necessary
steps
to
bring
it
about
if
this
is
so
we
are
members
indeed
of
the
god
of
this
world
but
we
are
not
his
children
we
are
children
of
the
unknown
and
vaster
god
who
called
him
into
existence
and
this
in
a
far
more
literal
sense
than
we
have
been
in
the
habit
of
realising
sic
to
ourselves
for
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
monads
are
not
as
truly
seminal
in
character
as
the
procreative
matter
from
which
all
animals
spring
it
must
be
remembered
that
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
view
put
forward
in
life
and
habit
and
in
evolution
old
and
new
and
i
have
met
with
no
serious
attempt
to
upset
the
line
of
argument
taken
in
either
of
these
books
then
no
complex
animal
or
plant
can
reach
its
full
development
without
having
already
gone
through
the
stages
of
that
development
on
an
infinite
number
of
past
occasions
an
egg
makes
itself
into
a
hen
because
it
knows
the
way
to
do
so
having
already
made
itself
into
a
hen
millions
and
millions
of
times
over
the
ease
and
unconsciousness
with
which
it
grows
being
in
themselves
sufficient
demonstration
of
this
fact
at
each
stage
in
its
growth
the
chicken
is
reminded
by
a
return
of
the
associated
ideas
of
the
next
step
that
it
should
take
and
it
accordingly
takes
it
but
if
this
is
so
and
if
also
the
congeries
of
all
the
living
forms
in
the
world
must
be
regarded
as
a
single
person
throughout
their
long
growth
from
the
primordial
cell
onwards
to
the
present
day
then
by
parity
of
reasoning
the
person
thus
compoundedthat
is
to
say
life
or
godshould
have
already
passed
through
a
growth
analogous
to
that
which
we
find
he
has
taken
upon
this
earth
on
an
infinite
number
of
past
occasions
and
the
development
of
each
class
of
life
with
its
culmination
in
the
vertebrate
animals
and
in
man
should
be
due
to
recollection
by
god
of
his
having
passed
through
the
same
stages
or
nearly
so
in
worlds
and
universes
which
we
know
of
from
personal
recollection
as
evidenced
in
the
growth
and
structure
of
our
bodies
but
concerning
which
we
have
no
other
knowledge
whatsoever
so
small
a
space
remains
to
me
that
i
cannot
pursue
further
the
reflections
which
suggest
themselves
a
few
concluding
considerations
are
here
alone
possible
we
know
of
three
great
concentric
phases
of
life
and
we
are
not
without
reason
to
suspect
a
fourth
if
there
are
so
many
there
are
very
likely
more
but
we
do
not
know
whether
there
are
or
not
the
innermost
sphere
of
life
we
know
of
is
that
of
our
own
cells
these
people
live
in
a
world
of
their
own
knowing
nothing
of
us
nor
being
known
by
ourselves
until
very
recently
yet
they
can
be
seen
under
a
microscope
they
can
be
taken
out
of
us
and
may
then
be
watched
going
here
and
there
in
perturbation
of
mind
endeavouring
sic
to
find
something
in
their
new
environment
that
will
suit
them
and
then
dying
on
finding
how
hopelessly
different
it
is
from
any
to
which
they
have
been
accustomed
they
live
in
us
and
make
us
up
into
the
single
person
which
we
conceive
ourselves
to
form
we
are
to
them
a
world
comprising
an
organic
and
an
inorganic
kingdom
of
which
they
consider
themselves
to
be
the
organic
and
whatever
is
not
very
like
themselves
to
be
the
inorganic
whether
they
are
composed
of
subordinate
personalities
or
not
we
do
not
know
but
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
they
are
and
if
we
touch
ground
so
to
speak
with
life
in
the
units
of
which
our
own
bodies
are
composed
it
is
likely
that
there
is
a
limit
also
in
an
upward
direction
though
we
have
nothing
whatever
to
guide
us
as
to
where
it
is
nor
any
certainty
that
there
is
a
limit
at
all
we
are
ourselves
the
second
concentric
sphere
of
life
we
being
the
constituent
cells
which
unite
to
form
the
body
of
god
of
the
third
sphere
we
know
a
single
member
onlythe
god
of
this
world
but
we
see
also
the
stars
in
heaven
and
know
their
multitude
analogy
points
irresistibly
in
the
direction
of
thinking
that
these
other
worlds
are
like
our
own
begodded
and
full
of
life
it
also
bids
us
believe
that
the
god
of
their
world
is
begotten
of
one
more
or
less
like
himself
and
that
his
growth
has
followed
the
same
course
as
that
of
all
other
growths
we
know
of
if
so
he
is
one
of
the
constituent
units
of
an
unknown
and
vaster
personality
who
is
composed
of
gods
as
our
god
is
composed
of
all
the
living
forms
on
earth
and
as
all
those
living
forms
are
composed
of
cells
this
is
the
unknown
god
beyond
this
second
god
we
cannot
at
present
go
nor
should
we
wish
to
do
so
if
we
are
wise
it
is
no
reproach
to
a
system
that
it
does
not
profess
to
give
an
account
of
the
origin
of
things
the
reproach
rather
should
lie
against
a
system
which
professed
to
explain
it
for
we
may
be
well
assured
that
such
a
profession
would
for
the
present
at
any
rate
be
an
empty
boast
it
is
enough
if
a
system
is
true
as
far
as
it
goes
if
it
throws
new
light
on
old
problems
and
opens
up
vistas
which
reveal
a
hope
of
further
addition
to
our
knowledge
and
this
i
believe
may
be
fairly
claimed
for
the
theory
of
life
put
forward
in
life
and
habit
and
evolution
old
and
new
and
for
the
corollary
insisted
upon
in
these
pages
a
corollary
which
follows
logically
and
irresistibly
if
the
position
i
have
taken
in
the
abovenamed
books
is
admitted
let
us
imagine
that
one
of
the
cells
of
which
we
are
composed
could
attain
to
a
glimmering
perception
of
the
manner
in
which
he
unites
with
other
cells
of
whom
he
knows
very
little
so
as
to
form
a
greater
compound
person
of
whom
he
has
hitherto
known
nothing
at
all
would
he
not
do
well
to
content
himself
with
the
mastering
of
this
conception
at
any
rate
for
a
considerable
time
would
it
be
any
just
ground
of
complaint
against
him
on
the
part
of
his
brother
cells
that
he
had
failed
to
explain
to
them
who
made
the
man
or
as
he
would
call
it
the
omnipotent
deity
whose
existence
and
relations
to
himself
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
but
if
he
were
to
argue
further
on
the
same
lines
as
those
on
which
he
had
travelled
hitherto
and
were
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
there
might
be
other
men
in
the
world
besides
the
one
whom
he
had
just
learnt
to
apprehend
it
would
be
still
no
refutation
or
just
ground
of
complaint
against
him
that
he
had
failed
to
show
the
manner
in
which
his
supposed
human
race
had
come
into
existence
here
our
cell
would
probably
stop
he
could
hardly
be
expected
to
arrive
at
the
existence
of
animals
and
plants
differing
from
the
human
race
and
uniting
with
that
race
to
form
a
single
person
or
god
in
the
same
way
as
he
has
himself
united
with
other
cells
to
form
man
the
existence
and
much
more
the
roundness
of
the
earth
itself
would
be
unknown
to
him
except
by
way
of
inference
and
deduction
the
only
universe
which
he
could
at
all
understand
would
be
the
body
of
the
man
of
whom
he
was
a
component
part
how
would
not
such
a
cell
be
astounded
if
all
that
we
know
ourselves
could
be
suddenly
revealed
to
him
so
that
not
only
should
the
vastness
of
this
earth
burst
upon
his
dazzled
view
but
that
of
the
sun
and
of
his
planets
also
and
not
only
these
but
the
countless
other
suns
which
we
may
see
by
night
around
us
yet
it
is
probable
that
an
actual
being
is
hidden
from
us
which
no
less
transcends
the
wildest
dream
of
our
theologians
than
the
existence
of
the
heavenly
bodies
transcends
the
perception
of
our
own
constituent
cells
the
end
