kennon
read
the
box
a
second
time
there
must
be
a
catch
to
it
nothing
that
paid
a
salary
that
large
could
possibly
be
on
the
level
fifteen
thousand
a
year
was
top
pay
even
on
beta
and
an
offer
like
this
for
a
new
graduate
was
unheard
ofunless
kardon
was
in
the
middle
of
an
inflation
but
kardon
wasnt
the
planets
financial
status
was
a
he
knew
hed
checked
that
immediately
after
landing
whatever
might
be
wrong
with
kardon
it
wasnt
her
currency
the
rate
of
exchange
was
betan
a
fiveyear
contracthmmthat
would
the
seventyfive
thousand
figure
three
thousand
a
year
for
living
expenses
that
would
leave
sixtyplenty
of
capital
to
start
a
clinic
the
banks
couldnt
turn
him
down
if
he
had
that
much
cash
collateral
kennon
chuckled
wryly
hed
better
get
the
job
before
he
started
spending
the
money
he
didnt
have
he
had
credits
plus
a
few
halves
tenths
and
hundredths
a
diploma
in
veterinary
medicine
some
textbooks
a
few
instruments
and
a
firstclass
spacemans
ticket
by
watching
his
expenses
he
had
enough
money
to
live
here
for
a
month
and
if
nothing
came
of
his
efforts
to
find
a
job
on
this
planet
there
was
always
his
spacemans
ticket
and
another
world
another
world
there
were
over
six
thousand
planets
in
the
brotherhood
of
man
at
two
months
per
planet
not
figuring
transit
time
it
would
take
more
than
a
thousand
galactic
standard
years
to
visit
them
all
and
a
man
could
look
forward
to
scarcely
more
than
five
hundred
at
best
the
habitat
of
man
had
become
too
large
there
wasnt
time
to
explore
every
possibility
but
a
man
could
have
certain
standards
and
look
until
he
found
a
position
that
fitted
the
trouble
wasif
the
standards
were
too
high
the
jobs
were
too
scarce
despite
the
chronic
shortage
of
veterinarians
throughout
the
brotherhood
there
was
a
peculiar
reluctance
on
the
part
of
established
practitioners
to
welcome
recent
graduates
most
of
the
ads
in
the
professional
journals
read
state
salary
desired
which
was
nothing
more
than
economic
blackmaila
baldfaced
attempt
to
get
as
much
for
as
little
as
possible
kennon
grimaced
wryly
hed
be
damned
if
hed
sell
his
training
for
six
thousand
a
year
slave
labor
thats
what
it
was
there
were
a
dozen
ads
like
that
in
the
journal
well
hed
give
them
a
trial
but
hed
ask
eight
thousand
and
full
gea
benefits
eight
years
of
school
and
two
more
as
an
intern
were
worth
at
least
that
he
pulled
the
portable
voicewrite
to
a
comfortable
position
in
front
of
the
view
wall
and
began
composing
another
of
the
series
of
letters
that
had
begun
months
ago
in
time
and
parsecs
away
in
space
his
voice
was
a
fluid
counterpoint
to
the
soft
hum
of
the
machine
and
as
he
dictated
his
eyes
took
in
the
vista
through
the
view
wall
albertsville
was
a
nice
town
too
young
for
slums
too
new
for
overpopulation
the
white
buildings
were
the
color
of
winter
butter
in
the
warm
yellow
sunlight
as
the
city
drowsed
in
the
noonday
heat
it
nestled
snugly
in
the
center
of
a
bowlshaped
valley
whose
surrounding
forest
clad
hills
gave
mute
confirmation
to
the
fact
that
kardon
was
still
primitive
an
unsettled
world
that
had
not
yet
reached
the
explosive
stage
of
population
growth
that
presaged
maturity
but
that
was
no
disadvantage
in
fact
kennon
liked
it
living
could
be
fun
on
a
planet
like
this
it
was
abysmally
crude
compared
to
beta
but
the
brotherhood
had
opened
kardon
less
than
five
hundred
years
ago
and
in
such
a
short
time
one
couldnt
expect
all
the
comforts
of
civilization
it
required
a
high
population
density
to
supply
them
and
while
kardon
was
integrated
its
population
was
scarcely
more
than
two
hundred
million
it
would
be
some
time
yet
before
this
world
would
achieve
a
class
i
status
however
a
class
ii
planet
had
some
advantages
what
it
lacked
in
conveniences
it
made
up
in
opportunities
and
elbow
room
a
normal
betan
would
have
despised
this
world
but
kennon
wasnt
normal
although
to
the
casual
eye
he
was
a
typical
representative
of
the
medicotechnological
civilization
long
legged
fair
haired
and
short
bodied
with
the
typical
betan
squint
that
left
his
eyes
mere
slits
behind
thick
lashes
and
heavy
brows
the
difference
was
internal
rather
than
external
possibly
it
was
due
to
the
fact
that
his
father
was
the
commander
of
a
shortliner
and
most
of
his
formative
years
had
been
spent
in
space
to
kennon
accustomed
to
the
timeless
horror
of
hyper
space
all
planets
were
good
broad
open
places
where
a
man
could
breathe
unfiltered
air
and
look
for
miles
across
distances
unbroken
by
dually
bulk
heads
and
safety
shields
on
a
planet
there
were
spaciousness
and
freedom
and
after
the
claustrophobic
confinement
of
a
hyper
ship
any
world
was
paradise
kennon
sighed
finished
his
letters
and
placed
them
in
the
mail
chute
perhaps
this
time
there
would
be
a
favorable
reply
chapter
ii
kennon
was
startled
by
the
speed
with
which
his
letters
were
answered
accustomed
to
the
slower
pace
of
beta
he
had
expected
a
week
would
elapse
before
the
first
reply
but
within
twentyfour
hours
nine
of
his
twelve
inquiries
were
returned
five
expressed
the
expected
thank
you
but
i
feel
that
your
asking
salary
is
a
bit
high
in
view
of
your
lack
of
experience
three
were
frankly
interested
and
requested
a
personal
interview
and
the
last
was
the
letter
outstanding
in
its
quietly
ostentatious
folderthe
reply
from
box
v
would
dr
kennon
call
at
am
tomorrow
at
the
offices
of
outworld
enterprises
incorporated
and
bring
this
letter
and
suitable
identifications
kennon
chuckled
would
he
there
was
no
question
about
it
the
address
central
avenue
was
only
a
few
blocks
away
in
fact
he
could
see
the
building
from
his
window
a
tall
functional
block
of
durilium
and
plastic
soaring
above
the
others
on
the
street
the
sunlight
gleaming
off
its
clean
square
lines
he
eyed
it
curiously
wondering
what
he
would
find
inside
the
receptionist
took
his
id
and
the
letter
scanned
them
briefly
and
slipped
them
into
one
of
the
message
tubes
beside
her
desk
it
will
only
be
a
moment
doctor
she
said
impersonally
would
you
care
to
sit
down
thank
you
he
said
the
minute
reflected
could
easily
be
an
hour
but
she
was
right
it
was
only
a
minute
until
the
message
tube
clicked
and
popped
a
capsule
onto
the
girls
desk
she
opened
it
and
removed
kennons
id
and
a
small
yellow
plastic
rectangle
her
eyes
widened
at
the
sight
of
the
plastic
card
here
you
are
doctor
take
shaft
number
one
slip
the
card
into
the
scanner
slot
and
youll
be
taken
to
the
correct
floor
the
offices
you
want
will
be
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
to
the
left
youll
find
any
other
data
you
may
need
on
the
card
in
case
you
get
lost
she
looked
at
him
with
a
curious
mixture
of
surprise
and
respect
as
she
handed
him
the
contents
of
the
message
tube
kennon
murmured
an
acknowledgment
took
the
card
and
his
id
and
entered
the
gravshaft
there
was
the
usual
moment
of
heaviness
as
the
shaft
whisked
him
upward
and
deposited
him
in
front
of
a
thickly
carpeted
corridor
executive
level
kennon
thought
as
he
followed
the
receptionists
directions
no
wonder
she
had
looked
respectful
but
what
was
he
doing
here
the
employment
of
a
veterinarian
wasnt
important
enough
to
demand
the
attention
of
a
senior
executive
the
personnel
section
could
handle
the
details
of
his
application
as
well
as
not
he
shrugged
perhaps
veterinarians
were
more
important
on
kardon
he
didnt
know
a
thing
about
this
worlds
customs
he
opened
the
unmarked
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
entered
a
small
reception
room
smiled
uncertainly
at
the
woman
behind
the
desk
and
received
an
answering
smile
in
return
come
right
in
dr
kennon
mr
alexander
is
waiting
for
you
alexander
the
entrepreneur
himself
why
numb
with
surprise
kennon
watched
the
woman
open
the
intercom
on
her
desk
sir
dr
kennon
is
here
she
said
bring
him
in
a
smooth
voice
replied
from
the
speaker
alexander
x
m
alexander
president
of
outsold
enterprisesa
lean
dark
wolfish
man
in
his
early
sixtieseyed
kennon
with
a
flat
predatory
intentness
that
was
oddly
disquieting
his
stare
combined
the
analytical
inspection
of
the
pathologist
the
probing
curiosity
of
the
psychiatrist
and
the
weighing
appraisal
of
the
butcher
kennons
thoughts
about
alexanders
youth
vanished
that
instant
those
eyes
belonged
to
a
leader
on
the
battlefield
of
galactic
business
kennon
felt
the
conditioned
respect
for
authority
surge
through
him
in
a
smothering
wave
grimly
he
fought
it
down
knowing
it
was
a
sign
of
weakness
that
would
do
him
no
good
in
the
interview
which
lay
ahead
so
youre
kennon
alexander
said
his
lingua
franca
was
clean
and
accentless
i
expected
someone
older
frankly
sir
so
did
i
kennon
replied
alexander
smiled
an
oddly
pleasant
smile
that
transformed
the
hard
straight
lines
in
his
face
into
friendly
curves
business
dr
kennon
is
not
the
sole
property
of
age
nor
is
a
veterinary
degree
kennon
replied
true
but
one
thinks
of
a
betan
as
someone
ancient
and
sedate
ours
is
an
old
planetbut
we
still
have
new
generations
a
fact
most
of
us
outsiders
find
hard
to
believe
alexander
said
i
picture
your
world
as
an
ironclad
society
crystallized
by
age
and
custom
into
something
rigid
and
in
flexible
you
would
be
wrong
to
do
so
kennon
said
even
though
we
are
cultural
introverts
there
is
plenty
of
dynamism
within
our
society
how
is
it
that
you
happen
to
be
out
here
on
the
edge
of
civilization
i
never
said
i
was
like
my
society
kennon
grinned
actually
i
suppose
im
one
of
the
proverbial
bad
apples
theres
more
to
it
than
that
alexander
said
your
early
years
probably
influenced
you
kennon
looked
sharply
at
the
entrepreneur
how
much
did
the
man
really
know
about
him
i
suppose
so
he
said
indifferently
alexander
looked
pleased
but
even
with
your
childhood
experiences
there
must
be
an
atavistic
streak
in
youa
throwback
to
your
adventurous
earth
forebears
who
settled
your
world
kennon
shrugged
perhaps
youre
right
i
really
dont
know
actually
ive
never
thought
about
it
it
merely
seemed
to
me
that
an
undeveloped
world
offered
more
opportunity
it
does
alexander
said
but
it
also
offers
more
work
if
youre
figuring
that
you
can
get
along
on
the
minimum
physical
effort
required
on
the
central
worlds
you
have
a
shock
coming
im
not
that
innocent
kennon
said
but
i
am
not
so
stupid
that
i
cant
apply
modifications
of
betan
techniques
to
worlds
as
new
as
this
alexander
chuckled
i
like
you
he
said
suddenly
here
read
this
and
see
if
youd
care
to
work
for
me
he
picked
a
contract
form
from
one
of
the
piles
of
paper
on
his
desk
and
handed
it
to
kennon
this
is
one
of
our
standard
work
contracts
take
it
back
to
your
hotel
and
check
it
over
ill
expect
to
see
you
at
this
time
tomorrow
why
waste
time
kennon
said
the
rapidreading
technique
originated
on
beta
i
can
tell
you
in
fifteen
minutes
hmm
certainly
read
it
here
if
you
wish
i
like
to
get
things
settledthe
sooner
the
better
sit
down
young
man
and
read
you
can
rouse
me
when
youre
finished
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
papers
on
his
desk
and
within
seconds
was
completely
oblivious
of
kennon
his
face
set
in
the
rapt
trancelike
expression
of
a
trained
rapid
reader
kennon
watched
for
a
moment
as
sheets
of
paper
passed
through
alexanders
hands
to
be
added
to
the
pile
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
desk
the
man
would
do
better
he
thought
if
he
would
have
his
staff
transcribe
the
papers
to
microfilm
that
could
be
read
through
an
intervaltimed
scanner
he
might
suggest
that
later
as
for
now
he
shrugged
and
seated
himself
in
the
chair
beside
the
desk
the
quiet
was
broken
only
by
the
rustle
of
paper
as
the
two
raptfaced
men
turned
page
after
page
with
mechanical
regularity
finally
kennon
turned
the
last
page
paused
blinked
and
performed
the
necessary
mental
gymnastics
to
orient
his
time
sense
alexander
he
noticed
was
still
engrossed
sunk
in
his
autohypnotic
trance
kennon
waited
until
he
had
finished
the
legal
folder
which
he
was
reading
and
then
gently
intruded
upon
alexanders
concentration
alexander
looked
up
blankly
and
then
went
through
the
same
mental
gyrations
kennon
had
performed
a
few
minutes
before
his
eyes
focused
and
became
hard
and
alert
well
he
asked
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
its
the
damnedest
trickiest
most
unilateral
piece
of
legalistics
ive
ever
seen
kennon
said
bluntly
if
thats
the
best
you
can
offer
i
wouldnt
touch
the
job
with
a
pair
of
forceps
alexander
smiled
i
see
you
read
the
fine
print
he
said
there
was
quiet
amusement
in
his
voice
so
you
dont
like
the
contract
no
sensible
man
would
im
damned
if
ill
sign
commitment
papers
just
to
get
a
job
no
wonder
youre
having
trouble
getting
professional
help
if
your
contracts
are
all
like
that
its
a
wonder
anyone
works
for
you
we
have
no
complaints
from
our
employees
alexander
said
stiffly
how
could
you
if
they
signed
that
contract
youd
have
a
perfect
right
to
muzzle
them
there
are
other
applicants
for
this
post
alexander
said
then
get
one
of
them
i
wouldnt
be
interested
a
spacemans
ticket
is
a
good
thing
to
have
alexander
said
idly
its
a
useful
ace
in
the
hole
besides
you
have
had
three
other
job
offersall
of
which
are
good
even
though
they
dont
pay
fifteen
ems
a
year
kennon
did
a
quick
double
take
alexanders
investigative
staff
was
better
than
good
it
was
uncanny
but
seriously
dr
kennon
i
am
pleased
that
you
do
not
like
that
contract
frankly
i
wouldnt
consider
employing
you
if
you
did
sir
that
contract
is
a
screen
it
weeds
out
the
careless
the
fools
and
the
unfit
in
one
operation
a
man
who
would
sign
a
thing
like
that
has
no
place
in
my
organization
alexander
chuckled
at
kennons
blank
expression
i
see
you
have
had
no
experience
with
screening
contracts
i
havent
kennon
admitted
on
beta
the
tests
are
formal
the
medicopsych
division
supervises
them
different
worlds
different
methods
alexander
observed
but
theyre
all
directed
toward
the
same
goal
here
we
arent
so
civilized
we
depend
more
on
personal
judgment
he
took
another
contract
from
one
of
the
drawers
of
his
desk
take
a
look
at
this
i
think
youll
be
more
satisfied
if
you
dont
mind
ill
read
it
now
kennon
said
alexander
nodded
its
fair
enough
kennon
said
except
for
article
twelve
the
personal
privilege
section
yes
well
thats
the
contract
you
can
take
it
or
leave
it
ill
leave
it
kennon
said
thank
you
for
your
time
he
rose
to
his
feet
smiled
at
alexander
and
turned
to
the
door
dont
bother
to
call
your
receptionist
he
said
i
can
find
my
way
out
just
a
minute
doctor
alexander
said
he
was
standing
behind
the
desk
holding
out
his
hand
another
test
kennon
inquired
alexander
nodded
the
critical
one
he
said
do
you
want
the
job
of
course
without
knowing
more
about
it
the
contract
is
adequate
it
defines
my
duties
and
you
think
you
can
handle
them
i
know
i
can
i
notice
alexander
observed
that
you
didnt
object
to
other
provisions
no
sir
theyre
pretty
rigid
but
for
the
salary
you
are
paying
i
figure
you
should
have
some
rights
certainly
you
have
the
right
to
protect
your
interests
but
that
article
twelve
is
a
direct
violation
of
everything
a
human
being
should
hold
sacred
besides
being
a
violation
of
the
peeper
laws
id
never
sign
a
contract
that
didnt
carry
a
full
peeper
rider
thats
quite
a
bit
thats
the
minimum
kennon
corrected
naturally
i
wont
object
to
mnemonic
erasure
of
matters
pertaining
to
your
business
once
my
contracts
completed
and
i
leave
your
employment
but
until
then
there
will
be
no
conditioning
no
erasures
no
taps
no
snoopers
and
no
checkups
other
than
the
regular
periodic
psychans
ill
consult
with
you
on
vacation
time
and
will
arrange
it
to
suit
your
convenience
ill
even
agree
to
emergency
recall
but
thats
the
limit
kennons
voice
was
flat
you
realize
im
agreeing
to
give
you
a
great
deal
of
personal
liberty
alexander
said
how
can
i
protect
myself
ill
sign
a
contingency
rider
kennon
said
if
you
will
specify
precisely
what
security
matters
i
am
not
to
reveal
i
accept
alexander
said
consider
yourself
hired
he
touched
a
button
on
his
desk
prepare
a
standard
a
contract
for
dr
jac
kennons
signature
and
attach
two
riders
a
full
ppyes
no
exceptionsand
a
securityleak
contingency
form
c
yesthats
rightthat
one
and
strike
out
all
provisions
of
article
twelve
which
conflict
with
the
peeper
laws
yes
nowand
finish
it
as
soon
as
you
can
he
touched
another
button
well
thats
that
he
said
i
hope
youll
enjoy
being
a
member
of
our
group
i
think
i
shall
kennon
said
you
know
sir
i
would
have
waived
part
of
that
last
demand
if
you
had
cared
to
argue
i
know
it
alexander
said
but
what
concessions
i
could
have
wrung
from
you
would
be
relatively
unimportant
beside
the
fact
that
you
would
be
unhappy
about
them
later
what
little
i
could
have
won
here
id
lose
elsewhere
and
since
i
want
you
id
prefer
to
have
you
satisfied
i
see
kennon
said
actually
he
didnt
see
at
all
he
looked
curiously
at
the
entrepreneur
alexander
couldnt
be
as
easy
as
he
seemed
objectivity
and
dispassionate
weighing
and
balancing
were
nice
traits
and
very
helpful
ones
but
in
the
bear
pit
of
galactic
business
they
wouldnt
keep
their
owner
alive
for
five
minutes
the
interworld
trade
sharks
would
have
skinned
him
long
ago
and
divided
the
stripped
carcass
of
his
company
between
them
but
outworld
was
a
respected
company
the
exchange
reports
said
sowhich
made
alexander
a
different
breed
of
cat
entirely
still
his
surface
was
perfectpolished
and
impenetrable
as
a
duralloy
turret
on
one
of
the
latest
brotherhood
battleships
kennon
regretted
he
wasnt
a
sensitive
it
would
be
nice
to
know
what
alexander
really
was
tell
me
sir
kennon
asked
what
are
the
real
reasons
that
make
you
think
im
the
man
you
want
and
youre
the
young
man
whos
so
insistent
on
a
personal
privacy
rider
alexander
chuckled
however
theres
no
harm
telling
you
there
are
several
reasons
youre
from
a
culture
whose
name
is
a
byword
for
moral
integrity
that
makes
you
a
good
risk
so
far
as
your
ethics
are
concerned
in
addition
youre
the
product
of
one
of
the
finest
educational
systems
in
the
galaxyand
you
have
proven
your
intelligence
to
my
satisfaction
you
also
showed
me
that
you
werent
a
spineless
yes
man
and
finally
you
have
a
spirit
of
adventure
not
one
in
a
million
of
your
people
would
do
what
you
have
done
what
more
could
an
entrepreneur
ask
of
a
prospective
employee
kennon
sighed
and
gave
up
alexander
wasnt
going
to
reveal
a
thing
all
i
hope
alexander
continued
affably
is
that
youll
find
outworld
enterprises
as
attractive
as
did
your
predecessor
dr
williamson
he
was
with
us
until
he
died
last
monthbetter
than
a
hundred
years
died
rather
young
didnt
he
not
exactly
he
was
nearly
four
hundred
when
he
joined
us
my
grandfather
was
essentially
conservative
he
liked
older
men
and
old
doc
was
one
of
his
choicesa
good
one
too
he
was
worth
every
credit
we
paid
him
ill
try
to
do
as
well
kennon
said
but
id
like
to
warn
you
that
i
have
no
intention
of
staying
as
long
as
he
did
i
want
to
build
a
clinic
and
i
figure
sixty
thousand
is
about
enough
to
get
started
when
will
you
veterinarians
ever
learn
to
be
organization
men
alexander
asked
youre
as
independent
as
tomcats
kennon
grinned
its
a
breed
characteristic
i
guess
alexander
shrugged
perhaps
youll
change
your
mind
after
youve
worked
for
us
possibly
but
i
doubt
it
tell
me
that
five
years
from
now
alexander
saidahhere
are
the
contracts
he
smiled
at
the
trim
secretary
who
entered
the
room
carrying
a
stack
of
papers
the
riders
are
as
you
asked
sir
the
girl
said
good
now
doctor
if
you
please
you
dont
mind
if
i
check
them
kennon
asked
not
at
all
and
when
youre
through
just
leave
them
on
the
deskexcept
for
your
copy
of
course
alexander
scrawled
his
signature
on
the
bottom
of
each
contract
dont
disturb
me
ill
be
in
contact
with
you
leave
your
whereabouts
with
your
hotel
he
turned
to
the
papers
in
front
of
him
and
then
looked
up
for
the
last
time
just
one
more
thing
he
said
you
impress
me
as
a
cautious
man
it
would
be
just
as
well
if
you
carried
your
caution
with
you
when
you
leave
this
room
kennon
nodded
and
alexander
turned
back
to
his
work
chapter
iii
id
never
have
guessed
yesterday
that
id
be
here
today
kennon
said
as
he
looked
down
at
the
yellow
waters
of
the
xantline
sea
flashing
to
the
rear
of
the
airboat
at
a
steady
thousand
kilometers
per
hour
as
they
sped
westward
in
the
middle
traffic
level
the
water
some
ten
thousand
meters
below
had
been
completely
empty
for
hours
as
the
craft
hurtled
through
the
equatorial
air
we
have
to
move
fast
to
stay
ahead
of
our
ulcers
alexander
said
with
a
wry
smile
besides
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
albertsville
offices
for
awhile
three
hours
notice
kennon
said
thats
almost
too
fast
you
had
nothing
to
keep
you
in
the
city
and
neither
did
iat
least
nothing
important
there
are
plenty
of
females
where
we
are
going
and
i
need
you
on
floranot
in
albertsville
besides
i
can
get
you
there
faster
than
if
you
waited
for
a
company
transport
judging
from
those
empty
sea
lanes
below
flora
must
be
an
outoftheway
place
kennon
said
it
is
its
out
of
the
trade
lanes
most
of
the
commercial
traffic
is
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
northern
hemisphere
is
practically
all
water
except
for
flora
and
the
otpens
there
isnt
a
land
area
for
nearly
three
thousand
kilometers
in
any
direction
and
since
the
company
owns
flora
and
the
surrounding
island
groups
theres
no
reason
for
shipping
to
come
there
we
have
our
own
supply
vessels
a
discovery
charter
and
a
desire
for
privacyah
it
wont
be
long
now
theres
the
otpens
alexander
pointed
at
a
smudge
on
the
horizon
that
quickly
resolved
into
an
irregular
chain
of
tiny
islets
that
slipped
below
them
kennon
got
a
glimpse
of
gray
concrete
on
one
of
the
larger
islands
a
smudge
of
green
trees
and
white
beaches
against
which
the
yellow
waters
dashed
in
smothers
of
foam
ruggedlooking
place
he
murmured
most
of
them
are
deserted
two
support
search
and
warning
stations
and
automatic
interceptors
to
protect
our
property
looktheres
flora
alexander
gestured
at
the
land
mass
that
appeared
below
flora
was
a
great
green
oval
two
hundred
kilometers
long
and
about
a
hundred
wide
pretty
isnt
it
alexander
said
as
they
sped
over
the
low
range
of
hills
and
the
single
gaunt
volcano
filling
the
eastward
end
of
the
island
and
swept
over
a
broad
green
valley
dotted
with
fields
and
orchards
interspersed
at
intervals
by
redroofed
structures
whose
purpose
was
obvious
our
farms
alexander
said
redundantly
the
airboat
crossed
a
fairsized
river
thats
the
styx
alexander
said
grandfather
named
it
he
was
a
classicist
in
his
wayspent
a
lot
of
his
time
reading
books
most
people
never
heard
of
things
like
the
iliad
and
gone
with
the
wind
the
mountains
he
called
the
apennines
and
that
volcanos
mount
olympus
the
marshland
to
the
north
is
called
the
pontine
marshesour
main
road
is
the
camino
real
alexander
grinned
theres
a
lot
of
earth
on
flora
youll
find
it
in
every
name
grandfather
was
an
earthman
and
he
used
to
get
nostalgic
for
the
homeworld
welltheres
alexandria
coming
up
weve
just
about
reached
the
end
of
the
line
kennon
stared
down
at
the
huge
graygreen
citadel
resting
on
a
small
hill
in
the
center
of
an
open
plain
it
was
a
class
ii
fortalice
built
on
the
efficient
starshaped
plan
of
half
a
millennium
agoan
ugly
spiky
pile
of
durilium
squat
and
massive
with
defensive
shields
and
weapons
which
could
still
withstand
hours
of
assault
by
the
most
modern
forces
why
did
he
build
a
thing
like
that
kennon
asked
alexandriawell
we
had
trouble
with
the
natives
when
we
first
came
and
grandfather
had
a
synthesizer
and
tapes
for
a
fortalice
in
his
ship
so
he
built
it
it
serves
the
dual
purpose
of
base
and
house
its
mostly
house
now
but
its
still
capable
of
being
defended
and
those
outbuildings
theyre
part
of
your
job
the
airboat
braked
sharply
and
settled
with
a
smooth
sickeningly
swift
rush
that
left
kennon
gaspingfeeling
that
his
stomach
was
still
floating
above
him
in
the
middle
level
he
never
had
become
accustomed
to
an
arbutus
landing
characteristics
spacers
were
slower
and
steadier
the
ship
landed
gently
on
a
pitted
concrete
slab
near
the
massive
radiation
shields
of
the
barricaded
entranceway
to
the
fortress
projectors
in
polished
dually
turrets
swivelled
to
point
their
ugly
noses
at
them
it
gave
kennon
a
queasy
feeling
he
never
liked
to
trust
his
future
to
automatic
machinery
if
the
analyzers
failed
to
decode
the
ships
id
properly
kennon
alexander
the
ship
and
a
fair
slice
of
surrounding
territory
would
become
an
incandescent
mass
of
dissociated
atoms
grandfather
was
a
good
builder
alexander
said
proudly
those
projectors
have
been
mounted
nearly
four
hundred
years
and
theyre
still
as
good
as
the
day
they
were
installed
i
can
see
that
kennon
said
uncomfortably
you
ought
to
dismantle
them
theyre
enough
to
give
a
man
the
weebies
alexander
chuckled
ohtheyre
safe
the
firing
mechanisms
safetied
but
we
keep
them
in
operating
condition
you
never
can
tell
when
theyll
come
in
handy
i
knew
kardon
was
primitive
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
that
bad
whats
the
trouble
noneright
now
alexander
said
obliquely
and
since
weve
shown
we
can
handle
ourselves
there
probably
wont
be
any
more
you
must
raise
some
pretty
valuable
stock
if
the
competition
tried
to
rustle
them
in
the
face
of
that
armament
we
do
alexander
said
now
if
youll
follow
methe
entrepreneur
opened
the
cabin
door
letting
in
a
blast
of
heat
and
a
flood
of
yellow
sunlight
great
arthur
fleming
kennon
exploded
this
place
is
a
furnace
its
hot
out
here
on
the
strip
alexander
admitted
but
its
cool
enough
inside
besides
youll
get
used
to
this
quickly
enoughand
the
nights
are
wonderful
the
evening
rains
cool
things
off
wellcome
along
he
began
walking
toward
the
arched
entrance
to
the
great
building
some
hundred
meters
away
kennon
followed
looking
around
curiously
so
this
was
to
be
his
home
for
the
next
five
years
it
didnt
look
particularly
inviting
there
was
a
forbidding
air
about
the
place
that
was
in
stark
contrast
to
its
pleasant
surroundings
they
were
only
a
few
meters
from
the
archway
when
a
stir
of
movement
came
from
its
shadowthe
first
life
kennon
had
seen
since
they
descended
from
the
ship
in
this
furnace
heat
even
the
air
was
quiet
two
women
came
out
of
the
darkness
moving
with
quiet
graceful
steps
across
the
blistering
hot
concrete
they
were
naked
except
for
a
loincloth
halter
and
sandals
and
so
nearly
identical
in
form
and
feature
that
kennon
took
them
to
be
twins
their
skins
were
burned
a
deep
brown
that
glistened
in
the
yellow
sun
light
kennon
shrugged
it
was
none
of
his
business
how
his
employer
ran
his
household
or
what
his
servants
wore
or
didnt
wear
santos
was
a
planet
of
nudists
and
certainly
this
hot
sun
was
fully
as
brilliant
as
the
one
which
warmed
that
tropical
planet
in
fact
he
could
see
some
virtue
in
wearing
as
little
as
possible
already
he
was
perspiring
the
two
women
walked
past
them
toward
the
airboat
kennon
turned
to
look
at
them
and
noticed
with
surprise
that
they
werent
human
the
long
tails
curled
below
their
spinal
bases
were
adequate
denials
of
human
ancestry
humanoids
he
gasped
for
a
moment
i
thought
gave
you
a
starteh
alexander
chuckled
it
always
does
when
a
stranger
sees
a
lani
for
the
first
time
wellnow
youve
seen
some
of
the
livestock
what
do
you
think
of
them
i
think
you
should
have
hired
a
medic
alexander
shook
his
head
noit
wouldnt
be
reason
able
or
legal
youre
the
man
for
the
job
but
ive
no
experience
with
humanoid
types
we
didnt
cover
that
phase
in
our
studiesand
from
their
appearance
theyd
qualify
as
humans
anywhere
if
it
werent
for
those
tails
theyre
far
more
similar
than
you
think
alexander
said
it
just
goes
to
show
what
parallel
evolution
can
do
but
there
are
differences
i
never
knew
that
there
was
indigenous
humanoid
life
on
kardon
kennon
continued
the
manual
says
nothing
about
it
naturally
theyre
indigenous
only
to
this
area
thats
impossible
species
as
highly
organized
as
that
simply
dont
originate
on
isolated
islands
this
was
a
subcontinent
once
alexander
said
most
of
it
has
been
inundated
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
years
ago
there
was
over
a
hundred
times
the
land
area
in
this
region
than
exists
today
then
the
ocean
rose
now
all
thats
left
is
the
mid
continent
plateau
and
a
few
mountain
tops
you
noted
i
suppose
that
this
is
mature
topography
except
for
that
range
of
hills
to
the
east
the
whole
land
area
at
the
time
of
flooding
was
virtually
a
peneplain
a
rise
of
a
few
hundred
feet
in
the
ocean
level
was
all
that
was
needed
to
drown
most
of
the
land
i
see
yes
its
possible
that
life
could
have
developed
here
under
those
conditions
a
peneplain
topography
argues
permanence
for
hundreds
of
millions
of
years
you
have
studied
geology
alexander
asked
curiously
only
as
part
of
my
cultural
base
kennon
said
merely
a
casual
acquaintance
we
think
the
lani
were
survivors
of
that
catastropheand
with
their
primitive
culture
they
were
unable
to
reach
the
other
land
masses
alexander
shrugged
at
any
rate
they
never
established
themselves
anywhere
else
how
did
you
happen
to
come
here
i
was
born
here
alexander
said
my
grandfather
discovered
this
world
better
than
four
hundred
years
ago
he
picked
this
area
because
it
all
could
be
comfortably
included
in
discovery
rights
it
wasnt
until
years
afterward
that
he
realized
the
ecological
peculiarities
of
this
region
he
certainly
capitalized
on
them
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
the
plants
and
animals
here
are
different
from
others
in
this
world
like
australia
in
reverse
kennon
looked
blank
and
alexander
chuckled
australia
was
a
subcontinent
on
earth
he
explained
its
ecology
however
was
exceedingly
primitive
when
compared
with
the
rest
of
the
planet
floras
on
the
contrary
wasand
isexceedingly
advanced
when
compared
with
other
native
life
forms
on
kardon
your
grandfather
stumbled
on
a
real
bonanza
kennon
said
for
which
im
grateful
alexander
grinned
its
made
me
the
biggest
operator
in
this
sector
of
the
galaxy
for
practical
purposes
i
own
an
independent
nation
theres
about
a
thousand
humans
here
and
nearly
six
thousand
lani
were
increasing
the
lani
now
since
we
found
they
have
commercial
possibilities
up
to
thirty
years
ago
we
merely
used
them
for
labor
kennon
didnt
speculate
on
what
alexander
meant
he
knew
for
practical
purposes
his
employer
was
a
slave
traderor
would
have
been
if
the
natives
were
human
as
it
was
the
analogy
was
so
close
that
it
wasnt
funny
they
entered
the
fortress
passed
through
a
decontamination
chamber
that
would
have
done
credit
to
an
exploration
ship
and
emerged
dressed
in
tunics
and
sandals
that
were
far
more
appropriate
and
comfortable
in
this
tropical
climate
thats
one
of
old
docs
ideas
alexander
said
gesturing
at
the
door
from
which
they
had
emerged
he
was
a
hound
for
sanitation
and
he
infected
us
with
the
habit
he
turned
and
led
the
way
down
an
arched
corridor
that
opened
into
a
huge
circular
room
studded
with
iris
doors
kennon
sucked
his
breath
in
with
a
low
gasp
of
amazement
the
room
was
a
gem
of
exquisite
beauty
the
parquet
floor
was
inlaid
with
rare
hardwoods
from
a
hundred
different
worlds
parthian
marble
veneer
covered
with
lacy
van
tapestries
from
santos
formed
the
walls
delicate
ceramics
sculpture
and
bronzes
reflected
the
art
of
a
score
of
different
civilizations
a
circular
pool
festooned
with
lacelike
halsite
ferns
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
surrounding
a
polished
black
granite
pedestal
on
which
stood
an
exquisite
bronze
of
four
lani
females
industriously
and
eternally
pouring
golden
water
from
vases
held
in
their
shapely
hands
beautiful
kennon
said
softly
we
like
it
alexander
said
we
oh
yesi
forgot
to
tell
you
about
the
family
alexander
said
grimly
i
run
outworld
and
own
fifty
per
cent
of
it
the
family
owns
the
other
fifty
there
are
eight
of
themthe
finest
collection
of
parasites
in
the
entire
galaxy
at
the
moment
they
cant
block
me
since
i
also
control
my
cousin
douglass
shares
but
when
douglas
comes
of
age
they
will
be
troublesome
therefore
i
defer
to
them
i
dont
want
to
build
a
united
opposition
usually
i
can
get
one
or
more
of
them
to
vote
with
me
on
critical
deals
but
i
always
have
to
pay
for
their
support
alexanders
voice
was
bitter
as
he
touched
the
dilate
button
on
the
iris
door
beside
him
youll
have
to
meet
them
tonight
theres
five
of
them
here
now
that
isnt
in
the
contract
kennon
said
he
was
appalled
at
alexander
civilized
people
didnt
speak
of
others
that
way
even
to
intimates
it
cant
be
helped
you
must
meet
them
its
part
of
the
job
alexanders
voice
was
grim
mother
cousin
anne
douglas
and
eloise
like
to
play
lord
of
the
manor
cousin
harold
doesnt
carefor
which
you
should
be
grateful
the
door
dilated
and
alexander
ushered
kennon
into
the
room
the
lani
sitting
on
the
couch
opposite
the
door
leaped
to
her
feet
her
mouth
opening
in
an
o
of
surprise
her
soft
snowwhite
hair
creamy
skin
and
bright
china
blue
eyes
were
a
startling
contrast
to
her
black
loincloth
and
halter
kennon
stared
appreciatively
her
effect
on
alexander
however
was
entirely
different
his
face
darkened
you
he
snapped
what
are
you
doing
here
serving
sir
the
lani
said
on
whose
authority
man
douglas
sir
alexander
groaned
you
see
he
said
turning
to
kennon
we
need
someone
here
with
a
little
sense
like
i
was
telling
you
the
familydhe
stopped
abruptly
and
turned
back
to
the
lani
your
name
and
pedigree
he
demanded
silver
dawn
sirout
of
white
magicplatinum
experimental
typestrain
four
i
thought
so
how
long
have
you
been
inhouse
almost
a
month
sir

terminated
report
to
goldie
and
tell
her
that
man
alexander

to
your
group
the
lanis
eyes
widened
man
alexanderyou
alexander
nodded
gosh
she
breathed
the
big
boss
get
moving
alexander
snapped
and
tell
goldie
to
report
to
me
in
my
quarters
yes
sir
right
away
sir
the
lath
ran
disappearing
through
the
door
they
had
entered
with
a
flash
of
shapely
white
limbs
that
douglas
alexander
growled
leave
that
young
fool
alone
here
for
six
months
and
hed
disrupt
the
entire
operation
the
nerve
of
that
young
puprequisitioning
an
experimental
type
for
household
labor
just
what
does
he
think
hes
doing
the
question
obviously
didnt
demand
a
reply
so
kennon
kept
discreetly
silent
as
alexander
crossed
the
room
to
the
two
doors
flanking
the
couch
on
which
the
lani
had
sat
he
opened
the
lefthand
one
revealing
a
modern
gravshaft
that
carried
them
swiftly
to
the
uppermost
level
they
walked
down
a
short
corridor
and
stopped
before
another
door
it
opened
into
a
suite
furnished
with
stark
functional
simplicity
it
fitted
the
entrepreneurs
outward
personality
so
exactly
that
kennon
had
no
doubt
that
this
was
alexanders
quarters
sit
down
kennon
relax
while
you
can
alexander
said
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
crossed
his
sandaled
feet
im
sure
you
have
many
questions
but
they
can
wait
you
might
as
well
get
some
rest
youll
have
little
enough
later
the
family
will
probably
put
you
through
the
meat
grinder
but
remember
that
they
dont
control
this
business
youre
my
man
kennon
had
hardly
seated
himself
in
another
chair
when
the
door
opened
and
a
plump
pinkskinned
lani
entered
she
was
considerably
older
than
the
silverhaired
one
he
had
seen
earlier
and
her
round
face
was
smiling
ah
goldie
alexander
said
i
understand
man
douglas
has
been
giving
you
quite
a
time
its
high
time
you
came
back
sir
she
said
since
old
doc
died
man
douglas
has
been
impossible
hes
been
culling
the
staff
and
replacing
them
with
emptyheaded
fillies
whose
only
claim
to
usefulness
is
that
they
can
fill
out
a
halter
pretty
soon
this
place
will
be
a
pigsty
ill
take
care
of
that
alexander
promised
now
id
like
you
to
meet
old
docs
replacement
this
is
dr
kennon
our
new
veterinarian
pleased
im
sure
goldie
said
you
look
like
a
nice
man
he
is
alexander
said
but
hes
just
as
hard
as
old
docand
hell
have
the
same
powers
goldies
the
head
housekeeper
alexander
added
shes
an
expert
and
youd
do
well
to
take
her
advice
on
assignments
kennon
nodded
have
a
maid
bring
us
a
light
meal
and
something
to
drink
alexander
said
have
a
couple
of
porters
take
dr
kennons
things
to
old
docs
house
find
man
douglas
and
tell
him
i
want
to
see
him
at
once
tell
the
family
that
ive
arrived
and
will
see
them
in
the
main
lounge
at
eight
tonight
tell
blalok
ill
be
seeing
him
at
nine
thats
all
yes
sir
goldie
said
and
left
the
room
her
tail
curling
buoyantly
a
good
lani
alexander
commented
one
of
the
best
loyal
trustworthy
intelligent
shes
been
running
alexandria
for
the
past
ten
years
and
should
be
good
for
at
least
ten
more
tenhow
old
is
she
thirty
thirtyyears
alexander
nodded
good
lord
lister
id
have
guessed
her
at
least
three
hundred
wrong
life
scale
lani
only
live
about
one
tenth
as
long
as
we
do
theyre
mature
at
twelve
and
dead
at
fifty
alexander
sighed
thats
another
difference
even
without
agerone
wed
live
to
be
a
hundred
have
you
tried
gerontological
injections
once
they
produced
death
in
about
two
days
killed
five
lani
with
them
alexanders
face
darkened
at
an
unpleasant
memory
so
we
dont
try
any
more
he
said
there
are
too
many
differences
he
stretched
id
tell
you
more
about
them
but
itll
be
better
to
hear
it
from
evald
blalok
hes
our
superintendent
steve
jordan
can
tell
you
a
lot
too
he
runs
the
lani
division
but
right
now
lets
wait
for
cousin
douglas
the
pup
will
take
his
time
about
comingbut
hell
do
it
in
the
end
hes
afraid
not
to
id
rather
not
kennon
said
its
poor
manners
to
be
injected
into
a
family
affairespecially
when
im
just
one
of
the
employees
youre
not
just
one
of
the
employees
you
are
the
station
veterinarian
and
as
such
you
hold
an
authority
second
only
to
blalok
and
myself
you
and
blalok
are
my
hands
ears
and
eyes
on
flora
you
are
responsible
to
meand
to
me
alone
while
i
defer
at
times
to
the
desires
of
the
family
i
do
not
have
to
i
run
outworld
enterprises
and
all
the
extensions
of
that
organization
i
possess
controland
the
family
knows
it
my
men
are
respected
and
furthermore
they
know
everything
that
goes
on
he
smiled
icily
in
a
way
its
quite
a
healthy
situation
it
keeps
my
relatives
under
control
somehow
they
dislike
being
disciplined
before
outsiders
now
think
no
more
about
it
alexander
stood
up
and
walked
over
to
one
of
the
windows
opening
onto
the
broad
roof
gardens
and
stood
looking
at
the
sundrenched
greenery
odd
isnt
it
alexander
said
how
beautiful
nature
is
and
how
simple
things
are
in
a
state
of
nature
its
only
when
man
interjects
himself
onto
a
scene
that
things
get
complicated
take
flora
for
instance
before
grandfather
came
here
it
must
have
been
a
pleasant
place
with
the
simple
natives
happy
in
their
paradise
but
thats
all
changed
now
we
have
taken
overand
they
like
other
lesser
creatures
on
other
worlds
have
been
bent
to
our
will
and
uses
i
could
pity
them
but
being
human
i
cannot
afford
that
luxury
kennon
understood
he
too
had
felt
that
sensation
that
odd
tightening
of
the
throat
when
he
first
saw
a
varl
on
santos
the
varl
had
been
the
dominant
life
form
there
until
men
had
come
now
they
were
just
another
animal
added
to
humanitys
growing
list
of
pets
and
livestock
the
little
varl
with
their
softfurred
bodies
and
clever
sixfingered
hands
made
excellent
pets
and
precision
workmen
the
products
of
those
clever
hands
the
tiny
instruments
the
delicate
microminiaturized
control
circuits
the
incredibly
fine
lacework
and
tapestries
formed
the
bulk
of
santos
interstellar
trade
he
had
owned
a
varl
once
and
had
delighted
in
its
almost
human
intelligence
but
the
varl
werent
human
and
there
lay
their
tragedy
two
thousand
years
of
human
domination
had
left
them
completely
dependent
on
their
conquerors
they
were
merely
intelligent
animalsand
that
was
all
they
would
ever
be
until
the
human
race
changed
its
cultural
pattern
or
was
overthrown
the
one
alternative
was
as
unlikely
as
the
other
humanity
had
met
some
fierce
competitors
but
none
with
its
explosive
acquisitive
nature
and
none
with
its
drive
to
conquer
colonize
and
rule
and
probably
it
never
would
the
little
varl
were
one
race
among
hundreds
that
had
fallen
before
the
fierceness
and
the
greed
of
men
but
unlike
most
others
the
varl
were
not
combative
therefore
they
had
survived
yet
had
it
been
necessary
to
reduce
them
to
slavery
they
would
never
be
a
threat
not
only
were
they
essentially
gentle
and
noncombative
but
their
delicate
bodies
could
not
stand
the
strains
of
spaceflight
they
were
trapped
on
their
world
why
should
they
be
forced
into
so
subordinate
a
rolewhy
was
humanity
so
jealous
of
its
dominance
that
no
other
species
could
exist
except
by
sufferance
why
after
five
thousand
years
of
exploration
invasion
and
colonization
did
the
human
race
still
consider
the
galaxy
as
its
oyster
and
themselves
uniquely
qualified
to
hold
the
knife
he
hadnt
thought
this
way
since
he
had
given
the
varl
to
his
girl
friend
of
the
moment
and
had
blasted
off
for
beta
now
the
questions
returned
to
haunt
him
as
a
betan
the
haunting
was
even
more
acute
since
beta
had
a
related
problem
that
was
already
troublesome
and
would
become
more
acute
as
the
years
passed
he
shrugged
and
laid
the
thought
aside
as
a
slim
darkhaired
lani
entered
pushing
a
service
cart
ahead
of
her
the
two
men
ate
silently
each
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
and
behind
the
view
wall
of
alexanders
apartment
kardons
brilliant
yellow
sun
sank
slowly
toward
the
horizon
filling
the
sky
with
flaming
colors
of
red
and
gold
rimmed
by
the
blues
and
purples
of
approaching
night
the
sunset
was
gaudy
and
blatant
kennon
thought
with
mild
distaste
unlike
the
restful
dayend
displays
of
his
homeworld
chapter
iv
douglas
alexander
was
a
puffyfaced
youngster
with
small
intolerant
eyes
set
in
folds
of
fat
above
a
button
nose
and
a
looselipped
sensual
mouth
there
was
an
odd
expression
of
defiance
overlaid
with
fear
on
his
pudgy
features
looking
at
him
kennon
was
reminded
of
a
frightened
dog
ready
either
to
bite
or
cower
but
it
wasnt
douglas
who
held
his
eye
it
was
the
two
lani
who
followed
him
into
the
room
every
line
of
their
bodies
was
perfection
that
spoke
volumes
about
generations
of
breeding
for
physical
elegance
they
moved
with
a
coordinated
grace
that
made
douglas
look
even
more
clumsy
by
contrast
and
they
were
identical
twin
creamandgold
works
of
art
they
were
completely
nudeand
kennon
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
fully
appreciated
the
beauty
of
an
unclad
female
to
cover
them
would
be
sacrilege
and
ornaments
would
only
detract
from
their
exquisite
perfection
kennon
knew
that
he
was
staring
like
an
idiot
alexanders
amused
smile
told
him
that
much
with
an
effort
he
composed
his
startled
features
the
pair
looked
at
him
with
soft
violet
eyesand
it
was
as
though
some
psychic
bathhouse
attendant
had
poured
ice
water
down
his
spine
for
he
had
seen
that
look
before
that
liquid
introspective
look
in
the
velvet
eyes
of
cattle
he
shivered
for
a
moment
he
had
been
thinking
of
them
as
human
and
somehow
the
lack
of
that
indefinable
some
thing
called
humanity
robbed
them
of
much
of
their
glamour
they
were
still
beautiful
but
their
beauty
had
become
impersonal
dont
take
these
as
representative
of
the
lani
alexander
said
suddenly
theyre
a
special
case
a
very
special
case
he
glared
at
his
cousin
damn
your
impudence
he
said
without
beat
i
sent
for
younot
your
toys
send
them
away
douglas
sulkily
thrust
out
his
lower
lip
you
cant
talk
to
me
like
that
cousin
alex
he
began
im
just
a
you
head
me
douglas
out
alexanders
voice
didnt
rise
but
it
cut
like
a
whip
oh
very
well
douglas
said
i
cant
fight
youyet
he
turned
to
the
humanoids
you
heard
the
bossman
go
home
the
two
nodded
in
unison
and
departed
quickly
somehow
kennon
got
the
impression
that
they
were
happy
to
leave
just
wait
douglas
said
you
cant
boss
me
forever
just
wait
ill
reach
my
majority
in
five
years
i
can
vote
my
shares
thenand
then
ill
fix
you
you
wont
be
so
high
and
mighty
then
mr
big
ill
throw
in
with
the
rest
of
the
family
they
dont
like
you
too
much
dont
hold
your
breath
waiting
for
the
family
to
help
you
alexander
said
they
wouldnt
have
anyone
else
but
me
handle
the
finances
they
love
money
too
much
and
until
you
get
your
inheritance
remember
one
thingim
master
here
i
know
it
douglas
said
and
then
curiouslywhos
the
oddball
he
gestured
at
kennon
with
a
pudgy
thumb
our
new
veterinarian
dr
kennon
ohgreat
now
you
tell
me
theres
nothing
like
making
a
good
first
impression
alexander
said
with
ironic
emphasis
i
hope
he
cuts
you
off
from
the
lani
hell
have
the
authority
to
do
it
since
hes
taking
old
docs
place
he
cant
im
an
owner
i
own
you
own
nothing
youre
a
minor
and
under
the
terms
of
grandfathers
will
youll
own
nothing
except
an
allowance
until
you
reach
legal
age
and
that
brings
me
to
the
reason
i
brought
you
here
just
when
did
you
gain
the
right
to
reorganize
the
household
staff
just
when
did
you
get
the
power
to
interfere
with
the
experimental
program
douglas
flushed
dull
red
and
bit
his
lip
do
we
have
to
go
into
this
in
front
of
strangers
kennons
my
agent
alexander
said
coldly
and
he
might
as
well
learn
about
you
and
the
others
from
the
start
wellwhat
do
you
want
him
to
dowatch
me
crawl
douglas
asked
bitterly
youll
make
me
do
it
you
always
do
do
you
want
me
to
beg
to
say
i
was
wrong
to
promise
i
wont
do
it
again
youve
done
that
already
alexander
said
several
times
you
need
a
lesson
i
wont
have
you
meddling
with
valuable
animals
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
put
you
where
you
can
do
no
more
damage
as
of
tomorrow
youll
go
to
otpen
one
douglas
paled
his
lips
quivered
and
his
eyes
flicked
uneasily
as
he
watched
alexanders
granite
face
you
dont
mean
that
he
said
finally
youre
joking
i
never
joke
about
business
but
you
cant
do
that
ill
tell
the
family
they
wont
let
you
i
already
have
their
consent
alexander
said
i
obtained
it
after
your
last
escapade
youll
be
happy
out
there
you
can
play
tin
god
all
you
like
master
of
life
and
death
on
a
twoacre
island
no
one
will
mind
you
can
also
go
to
work
no
one
will
mind
that
either
and
mullins
wont
mind
as
long
as
you
leave
the
troops
alone
now
get
out
of
here
and
get
packed
youre
leaving
tomorrow
morning
but
cousin
alex
move
im
tired
of
the
sight
of
you
alexander
said
douglas
turned
and
shambled
out
of
the
room
his
ego
was
thoroughly
deflated
and
he
seemed
more
frightened
than
before
obviously
the
otpens
werent
the
pleasantest
place
in
this
world
theyre
a
military
post
alexander
said
and
commander
mullins
doesnt
like
douglas
cant
say
that
i
blame
him
douglas
is
a
thoroughly
unpleasant
specimen
and
incidentally
quite
typical
of
the
rest
of
the
family
alexander
sighed
and
spread
his
hands
in
a
gesture
that
combined
disgust
and
resignation
sometimes
i
wonder
why
i
have
been
cursed
with
my
relatives
kennon
nodded
the
implications
behind
the
empty
eyes
of
douglass
lani
sickened
him
there
were
several
ways
to
produce
that
expression
all
of
them
unpleasant
hypnoconditioning
the
quiet
treatment
brainburning
transorbital
leukotomy
lobectomyall
of
the
products
of
that
diseased
period
of
humanitys
thinking
when
men
tampered
with
the
brains
of
other
men
in
an
effort
to
cure
psychic
states
psychiatry
had
passed
that
period
at
least
on
the
civilized
worlds
where
even
animal
experiments
were
frowned
upon
as
unnecessary
cruelty
you
saw
those
two
lani
alexander
said
grandfather
had
them
made
that
way
as
a
birthday
present
for
douglas
he
was
getting
senile
he
died
a
year
later
youd
think
a
man
would
be
ashamed
to
keep
things
like
that
aroundbut
not
douglas
he
likes
them
alexanders
voice
was
tinged
with
contempt
he
knows
they
disgust
meso
he
parades
them
in
i
could
strangle
that
pup
sometimes
i
wondered
about
it
i
wouldnt
like
to
work
for
a
man
who
permitted
such
things
that
was
done
before
i
took
over
for
the
past
three
years
there
have
been
no
dockings
no
mutilations
i
cant
see
treating
a
helpless
animal
like
that
i
feel
better
about
it
kennon
said
i
didnt
think
you
were
that
sort
understand
me
alexander
said
im
always
opposed
to
senseless
cruelty
and
wasteparticularly
when
its
dangerous
docked
lani
are
the
height
of
stupidity
just
because
someone
wants
a
pet
that
is
an
exact
duplicate
of
a
human
being
is
no
reason
to
risk
a
court
action
those
lani
and
a
few
others
whose
tails
have
been
docked
could
be
a
legal
bombshell
if
they
ever
left
flora
kennon
was
jolted
he
had
been
thinking
of
mental
mutilation
and
alexander
had
been
talking
physical
naturally
they
would
be
dangerous
property
anyone
attempting
to
sell
a
docked
lani
would
probably
be
thrown
in
detention
and
charged
with
slave
trading
did
you
ever
figure
the
cost
of
taking
a
legal
action
through
our
court
system
alexander
asked
even
the
small
ones
set
you
back
four
or
five
thousand
and
a
firstclass
action
like
a
humanity
trial
could
cost
over
a
million
grandfather
found
that
out
sure
there
are
differences
between
lani
and
humans
but
a
smart
lawyer
can
make
them
seem
trivial
until
the
final
test
and
that
would
drag
on
for
nearly
two
years
until
all
the
requirements
were
satisfiedand
by
that
time
the
unfavorable
publicity
would
drop
sales
to
zero
the
family
would
be
on
my
neck
for
lost
dividends
and
id
lose
much
of
the
control
i
hold
over
them
sure
its
possible
that
prehensile
tails
could
be
produced
by
mutation
but
so
far
as
we
know
it
hasnt
happened
in
human
history
as
a
result
the
tail
serves
as
a
trademarksomething
that
can
be
easily
recognized
by
anyone
so
we
sell
them
intact
alexander
crossed
his
legs
and
settled
back
in
his
chair
shocks
you
doesnt
it
kennon
nodded
yes
he
admitted
it
does
i
know
you
cant
help
it
most
of
our
new
employees
think
the
lani
are
humanat
first
they
learn
better
but
adjustment
is
always
a
strain
they
keep
confusing
external
appearances
with
the
true
article
but
remember
thislani
are
not
human
theyre
animals
and
on
this
island
theyre
treated
as
what
they
areno
more
no
less
they
are
a
part
of
our
economics
and
are
bred
fed
and
managed
according
to
sound
livestock
principles
despite
some
of
the
things
you
may
see
here
in
alexandria
dont
forget
that
you
are
a
veterinarian
your
job
is
to
handle
disease
problems
in
animals
lani
are
animals
therefore
you
will
be
doing
your
job
i
was
disappointed
in
your
reaction
when
you
first
saw
them
but
i
suppose
it
was
natural
at
any
rate
this
should
clear
the
air
it
doesintellectually
kennon
admitted
but
the
physical
resemblance
is
so
close
that
it
is
difficult
to
accept
alexander
smiled
dont
worry
youll
accept
it
in
time
now
i
think
its
time
that
you
met
the
family
chapter
v
the
main
salon
was
crowded
the
huge
room
glittering
with
mirrors
and
crystal
floored
with
thick
carpets
and
hung
with
rich
drapes
had
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
sarkian
harem
although
there
were
only
five
of
the
alexander
family
present
there
were
at
least
twenty
lani
whose
costumes
ranged
from
the
black
g
string
and
halter
of
the
household
staff
to
the
utter
nudity
of
douglass
playthings
they
were
all
female
and
kennon
wondered
for
a
moment
what
a
male
was
like
besides
alexander
there
were
two
men
and
three
women
douglas
still
with
his
sulky
expression
an
older
man
in
his
late
nineties
who
looked
like
douglass
eider
brother
two
mature
women
who
could
be
any
age
from
fifty
to
three
hundred
and
a
girl
she
might
have
been
thirtyperhaps
younger
perhaps
older
a
lean
feminine
edition
of
alexander
with
the
same
intriguing
face
and
veiled
predatory
look
there
was
a
hardness
about
her
that
was
absent
in
the
others
kennon
had
the
feeling
that
whatever
this
girl
did
she
didnt
do
it
half
way
my
sister
eloise
alexander
said
in
a
low
voice
watch
out
for
her
shes
as
deadly
as
a
puff
adder
and
she
collects
men
the
other
man
is
douglass
father
henry
the
plump
redhead
beside
him
is
his
wife
anne
the
other
woman
is
my
mother
clara
even
though
eloise
and
i
dont
look
like
her
we
take
after
father
wheres
he
kennon
whispered
dead
alexander
replied
he
was
killed
twenty
years
ago
id
like
to
present
dr
jac
kennon
our
new
veterinarian
alexander
said
into
the
hush
that
followed
their
entrance
the
introductions
that
followed
were
in
proper
form
and
kennon
was
beginning
to
feel
more
at
ease
until
eloise
sent
one
of
her
lani
with
a
summons
he
looked
around
for
alexander
but
the
entrepreneur
was
the
center
of
a
threecornered
argument
hemmed
in
by
douglas
henry
and
anne
henrys
voice
was
raised
in
bitter
protest
that
alexander
was
exceeding
his
authority
he
shrugged
there
was
no
help
there
all
right
he
said
tell
your
mistress
ill
be
along
in
a
moment
yes
doctor
the
lani
said
but
the
woman
eloise
says
for
you
to
come
and
she
is
not
accustomed
to
being
disobeyed
tell
her
what
i
said
kennon
replied
i
shall
be
there
directly
he
crossed
to
the
table
and
examined
it
selecting
a
cluster
of
odd
purple
fruit
which
looked
more
interesting
than
it
tasted
when
he
had
finished
he
walked
leisurely
over
to
where
eloise
sat
she
looked
at
him
angrily
i
am
accustomed
to
being
obeyed
by
my
employees
she
said
coldly
her
dark
eyes
oddly
like
her
brothers
traversed
his
hard
body
like
twin
scanners
he
returned
her
appraising
stare
with
one
of
his
own
im
not
your
employee
he
said
bluntly
i
was
hired
by
your
brother
and
theres
a
full
peeper
rider
on
my
contract
his
eyes
traveled
slowly
over
her
carefully
arranged
hair
her
makeup
her
jewelry
at
throat
and
arms
her
painted
finger
and
toenails
and
then
across
the
slim
smallbreasted
lines
of
her
body
half
revealed
under
her
thin
anklelength
tunic
of
lyranian
silk
satisfied
she
asked
on
beta
he
said
bluntly
your
appearance
would
qualify
you
for
a
parasite
camp
six
months
of
hard
labor
would
do
you
no
end
of
good
youre
soft
lazy
and
undisciplined
eloise
gasped
why
you
she
sputtered
and
perhaps
next
time
youll
learn
to
be
polite
kennon
continued
imperturbably
after
all
the
superficial
attributes
of
good
breeding
are
not
too
hard
to
counterfeit
to
his
surprise
eloise
giggled
you
bite
dont
you
she
asked
remind
me
to
remember
that
i
shall
of
course
your
actions
werent
good
breeding
either
admittedbut
ive
never
pretended
to
be
what
im
not
im
the
son
of
a
spaceship
skipper
and
im
a
veterinarian
thats
all
thats
not
all
you
are
also
a
man
her
face
was
sober
its
been
some
time
since
ive
met
one
id
almost
forgotten
they
existed
theres
your
brother
alexhes
a
money
making
machine
comesit
beside
me
and
lets
talk
about
what
youmeyour
job
your
lifeanything
you
wish
that
line
isnt
exactly
new
kennon
grinned
i
know
she
admitted
but
it
usually
works
im
immune
thats
what
you
think
eloises
eyes
were
frankly
appraising
i
think
i
could
become
interested
in
you
i
have
a
job
here
i
dont
think
i
would
have
time
to
give
you
the
attention
youd
demand
i
get
bored
easily
it
probably
wouldnt
be
long
before
i
would
be
tired
of
you
perhapsand
perhaps
not
i
cant
afford
to
take
the
chance
you
seem
confident
you
forget
i
was
a
sailor
and
spacemen
have
a
reputation
eh
eloise
chuckled
at
that
you
might
be
right
i
remember
the
first
officer
of
she
let
the
thought
die
but
i
became
tired
of
him
she
finished
kennon
smiled
ive
never
had
that
complaint
perhaps
youd
like
to
make
the
acid
test
she
asked
perhaps
he
said
but
not
tonight
tomorrow
then
alex
will
be
leaving
in
the
morning
he
never
stays
more
than
a
few
hours
eloises
eyes
were
bright
her
lips
moist
and
red
ill
pick
the
time
kennon
saidand
added
to
himself
if
ever
despite
her
wealth
eloise
was
no
different
from
the
portofcall
girls
if
anything
she
was
worse
since
she
had
enough
money
to
implement
her
desires
they
were
merely
in
the
trade
for
business
reasons
noeloise
would
be
something
to
steer
clear
of
alexander
was
right
she
was
a
mantrap
he
stood
up
and
bowed
betan
fashion
i
see
your
brother
is
free
now
he
wants
to
brief
me
on
my
duties
here
we
were
discussing
it
before
we
entered
eloise
pouted
you
can
always
do
that
you
said
yourself
that
alexander
never
stays
here
very
long
i
would
be
a
poor
employee
if
i
delayed
him
he
grinned
knowingly
at
her
and
she
smiled
back
with
complete
understanding
very
well
then
get
your
business
done
your
pleasure
can
wait
kennon
steered
alexander
over
to
an
open
window
that
led
to
a
balcony
whew
he
said
i
see
what
you
mean
shes
a
tartar
alexander
agreed
i
suspect
that
shes
a
nymphomaniac
you
suspect
kennon
asked
by
this
time
you
should
know
lets
get
out
of
here
ive
had
about
all
of
your
sister
i
care
to
take
cant
say
as
i
blame
you
ill
show
you
to
your
quarters
maybe
old
doc
left
a
bottle
or
two
although
i
suspect
the
old
sinner
hung
on
until
the
last
one
was
empty
if
he
had
to
put
up
with
your
relatives
as
a
steady
diet
i
cant
say
that
i
blame
him
kennon
said
careful
doctor
youre
talking
about
my
kinfolk
alexander
said
wryly
at
that
though
you
have
a
point
the
two
men
slipped
quietly
from
the
room
apparently
none
of
the
family
was
conscious
of
their
departure
except
eloise
who
watched
them
leave
with
an
enigmatic
expression
on
her
narrow
face
they
left
the
fortress
through
the
rear
gate
and
walked
slowly
down
the
winding
path
that
led
to
the
cluster
of
buildings
in
the
valley
below
it
was
a
beautiful
night
calm
and
clear
with
the
stars
shining
down
from
the
dark
vault
of
the
heavens
the
constellations
were
strange
and
kennon
missed
the
moons
beta
had
three
two
of
which
were
always
in
the
sky
but
kardon
was
moonless
somehow
it
gave
the
sky
an
empty
look
a
damp
coolness
rose
from
the
ground
as
the
evening
rain
evaporated
mistily
into
the
still
air
kennon
sniffed
the
odor
of
soil
and
growing
vegetation
clean
pleasant
odors
in
contrast
to
what
he
had
left
in
the
distance
a
bird
called
sleepily
from
one
of
the
fortress
turrets
and
was
answered
by
some
creature
kennon
couldnt
identify
a
murmur
of
blended
sound
came
from
the
valley
below
punctuated
by
highpitched
laughter
someone
was
singing
or
perhaps
chanting
would
be
a
better
description
the
melody
was
strange
and
the
words
unrecognizable
the
thin
whine
of
an
atomotor
in
the
fortresss
generating
plant
slowly
built
up
to
a
keening
undertone
that
blended
into
the
pattern
of
halfperceived
sound
nice
isnt
it
alexander
remarked
as
they
rounded
another
turn
on
the
switchback
path
yes
you
cant
hear
a
sound
from
back
there
except
for
that
generator
its
almost
as
though
we
shut
those
people
out
of
existence
by
merely
closing
a
door
i
wish
it
were
that
simple
alexander
said
but
doors
that
can
be
closed
can
also
be
opened
wellthink
youll
like
it
here
i
think
so
providing
i
dont
have
to
entertain
your
relatives
you
mean
eloise
dont
worry
about
her
shes
as
fickle
as
the
wind
ive
never
seen
anyone
so
frankly
predatory
kennon
said
she
worries
me
theyll
all
be
gone
tomorrowexcept
for
eloise
alexander
said
with
mock
comfort
douglas
is
on
the
otpens
for
a
year
and
the
others
are
off
somewhere
youll
be
staying
i
suppose
noim
afraid
i
cant
i
hoped
youd
help
me
get
organized
this
whole
thing
has
been
something
of
a
shock
i
was
expecting
something
entirely
different
sorrysomeone
has
to
run
the
business
but
blalokll
brief
you
actually
hes
more
qualified
than
i
he
knows
everything
worth
knowing
about
this
place
were
going
past
his
house
in
a
minutewant
to
stop
in
and
see
him
its
pretty
late
not
for
blalok
hes
a
mystica
nocturnal
hes
probably
doing
his
work
now
perhaps
we
shouldnt
disturb
him
nonsense
hes
used
to
it
i
visit
him
frequently
at
night
surebut
youre
the
boss
wellin
a
sense
you
are
too
at
least
in
the
veterinary
end
of
this
business
alexander
swung
sharply
to
the
left
and
climbed
a
short
flight
of
stairs
that
led
to
the
nearest
house
lights
flared
on
the
deep
porch
and
the
oldfashioned
iris
door
dilated
to
frame
the
black
silhouette
of
a
stocky
broadshouldered
man
good
evening
sir
he
said
i
was
expecting
you
that
the
new
vet
with
you
your
pipelines
still
working
i
see
alexander
said
yes
this
is
dr
kennonevald
blaloki
wanted
you
two
to
meet
kennon
liked
the
gray
middleaged
man
he
looked
honest
and
competent
a
solid
quiet
man
with
a
craggy
face
and
the
deepset
eyes
of
a
mystic
his
skin
had
the
typical
thickness
and
pore
prominence
of
the
dwellers
on
that
foggy
world
from
which
he
came
but
unlike
the
natives
of
myst
his
skin
was
burned
a
dark
brown
by
kardons
sun
he
seemed
out
of
place
on
this
tropic
world
but
kennon
reflected
wryly
that
there
was
probably
more
than
one
misplaced
human
here
himself
included
ive
been
going
over
station
fourteens
records
with
jordan
blalok
said
as
he
ushered
them
into
the
house
a
tall
blackhaired
man
rose
as
they
entered
skip
the
formality
jordan
sit
down
alexander
said
and
meet
dr
kennonsteve
jordanjordan
runs
the
lani
division
kennon
nodded
acknowledgment
as
alexander
continued
whats
this
trouble
at
fourteen
i
dont
know
weve
got
an
epizootic
of
something
another
youngster
died
this
morning
and
theres
three
more
that
look
pretty
bad
jaundice
no
appetite
complaining
of
muscular
pains
same
symptoms
as
took
the
others
the
one
this
morning
makes
the
fourth
this
month
and
were
only
half
through
it
are
all
your
losses
in
this
one
station
kennon
asked
nobut
its
worst
there
i
dont
like
losses
like
that
alexander
said
neither
do
i
jordan
replied
this
isnt
jordans
fault
sir
blalok
said
quickly
as
you
know
we
havent
had
a
vet
for
three
months
two
alexander
corrected
threeold
doc
wasnt
around
at
all
the
month
before
he
died
blalok
said
as
a
result
weve
got
a
problem
we
need
professional
help
well
here
he
isuse
him
alexander
said
he
looked
at
kennon
a
trace
of
amusement
on
his
face
theres
nothing
like
getting
into
things
early
particularly
when
one
comes
into
them
stone
cold
kennon
added
its
a
poor
way
to
start
a
career
we
cant
afford
to
wait
jordan
said
we
need
help
ill
see
what
can
be
done
kennon
replied
have
you
saved
the
body
every
one
of
them
jordan
said
theyre
in
the
hospital
in
the
autopsy
room
that
was
sensible
a
postmortem
might
give
us
an
answer
wheres
the
hospital
ill
show
you
jordan
offered
count
me
out
alexander
said
i
have
a
weak
stomach
ill
go
along
if
its
necessary
blalok
said
theres
a
staff
there
old
doc
trained
them
jordan
said
then
it
shouldnt
be
necessary
kennon
said
blalok
sighed
with
relief
and
turned
to
alexander
we
could
check
the
records
while
those
two
are
about
their
bloody
work
id
rather
check
a
long
strong
drink
alexander
replied
what
with
the
family
and
this
its
too
much
to
take
for
one
evening
kennon
hid
a
smile
alexander
had
a
weak
spot
he
was
squeamish
that
was
a
good
thing
to
know
chapter
vi
jordan
opened
the
door
of
the
twostory
building
below
blaloks
house
this
is
it
he
said
just
outside
your
front
door
convenientno
too
convenient
kennon
said
also
too
quiet
isnt
anyone
on
duty
i
wouldnt
know
old
doc
never
kept
the
place
open
at
night
there
was
a
stir
of
movement
in
the
darkness
the
lights
flashed
on
and
a
sleepyeyed
lani
blinked
at
them
in
the
sudden
glare
she
looked
blankly
at
kennon
and
then
brightened
as
she
saw
jordan
whats
the
trouble
sir
she
asked
nothing
we
want
to
look
at
the
lani
i
sent
down
this
morningdr
kennon
would
like
to
inspect
the
carcass
youre
the
new
doctor
the
lani
asked
thank
goodness
youve
come
ill
get
the
staff
ill
be
back
in
a
moment
she
stepped
quickly
over
to
the
switchboard
beside
the
door
and
punched
five
buttons
four
more
humanoids
came
into
the
room
followed
a
little
later
by
a
fifth
wheres
the
emergency
one
asked
he
isits
our
new
doctor
more
females
kennon
muttered
to
himself
he
turned
to
jordan
arent
there
any
males
in
this
crew
jordan
stared
at
him
with
mild
surprise
no
sirdidnt
you
know
there
are
no
male
lani
what
just
that
jordan
said
only
females
there
hasnt
been
a
male
on
the
island
since
old
man
alexander
took
over
he
killed
them
all
but
thats
impossible
how
do
they
reproduce
ever
hear
of
artificial
fertilization
surebut
thats
a
dead
end
the
offspring
are
haploids
and
theyre
sterile
the
line
would
die
out
in
a
generation
not
the
laniyou
can
see
for
yourself
weve
been
using
the
technique
here
for
better
than
four
centuries
and
were
still
doing
all
right
over
forty
generations
so
far
and
from
the
looks
of
things
we
can
go
on
indefinitely
but
how
is
it
done
i
dont
know
thats
alexanders
secret
the
bossman
doesnt
tell
us
everything
all
i
know
is
that
we
get
results
old
doc
knew
how
it
was
done
and
i
suppose
you
will
too
but
dont
ask
me
im
dumb
kennon
shrugged
maybemaybe
not
at
any
rate
there
was
no
sense
in
belaboring
the
point
he
turned
to
the
staff
five
of
them
were
the
same
bigboned
heavyframed
type
that
apparently
did
most
of
the
manual
labor
the
sixth
the
late
arrival
was
an
elegant
creature
a
bronzeskinned
greeneyed
minx
with
an
elfin
face
half
hidden
under
a
wavy
mass
of
redbrown
hair
unlike
the
others
she
had
been
dockedand
in
contrast
to
their
heavy
eyes
and
sleeppuffed
features
she
was
alert
and
lively
she
flashed
him
an
impish
grin
revealing
clean
white
teeth
kennon
smiled
back
he
couldnt
help
it
and
suddenly
the
tension
and
strangeness
was
broken
he
felt
oddly
at
ease
which
of
you
are
on
duty
he
asked
all
of
us
the
redhead
replied
if
its
necessary
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
hes
already
told
me
he
wants
that
last
carcass
prepped
for
a
postmortem
the
nightcall
lani
said
good
the
redhead
said
itll
be
nice
to
get
to
work
again
she
turned
to
face
kennon
now
doctorwould
you
like
to
see
your
office
old
doc
left
a
fine
collection
of
notes
on
lani
anatomy
and
perhaps
you
could
do
with
a
little
review
i
could
do
with
a
lot
of
it
kennon
admitted
unless
the
inner
structure
of
a
lani
is
as
similar
to
human
as
their
outer
there
are
differences
the
redhead
admitted
after
all
we
arent
quite
alike
perhaps
id
better
do
some
reading
kennon
said
you
need
me
any
more
jordan
asked
noi
think
not
good
ill
get
back
frankly
i
dont
like
this
any
better
than
blalok
or
the
boss
but
im
low
man
on
that
pole
see
you
later
kennon
chuckled
as
jordan
left
now
lets
get
ready
for
that
cadaver
he
said
carcass
doctor
the
redhead
corrected
a
cadaver
is
a
dead
human
body
she
accented
the
human
even
in
death
there
is
no
equality
kennon
thought
he
nodded
and
the
lani
led
the
way
to
a
door
which
opened
into
a
goodsized
office
liberally
covered
with
bookshelves
an
oldfashioned
plastic
desk
some
office
cybernetics
a
battered
voicewriter
and
a
few
chairs
completed
the
furnishings
the
redhead
placed
several
large
folio
volumes
in
front
of
him
and
stepped
back
from
the
desk
as
he
leafed
rapidly
through
the
color
plates
it
was
an
excellent
atlas
dr
williamson
had
been
a
careful
and
competent
workman
half
an
hour
later
well
fortified
with
a
positional
knowledge
of
lani
viscera
kennon
looked
up
at
the
redhead
she
was
still
standing
patiently
a
statue
of
redgold
and
bronze
get
a
smock
and
lets
go
he
said
nowait
a
minute
yes
sir
whats
your
name
i
dont
want
to
say
hey
you
she
smiled
its
copper
glowwant
my
pedigree
too
noit
wouldnt
mean
anything
to
me
do
they
call
you
copper
or
glow
or
both
just
copper
sir
very
well
copperlets
get
going
the
body
of
the
dead
lani
lay
on
the
steel
table
waxy
and
yellowish
in
the
pitiless
light
of
the
fluorescents
she
had
been
hardly
more
than
a
child
kennon
felt
a
twinge
of
pityso
youngso
young
to
die
and
as
he
looked
he
was
conscious
of
another
feeling
it
had
been
an
open
secret
among
his
classmates
that
he
had
refused
an
offer
to
study
human
medicine
because
of
his
aversion
to
dissecting
cadavers
the
sarcoplastic
models
were
all
right
but
when
it
came
to
flesh
kennon
didnt
have
the
stomach
for
it
and
now
the
sight
of
the
dead
humanoid
brought
back
the
same
cold
sweat
and
gutwrenching
nausea
that
had
caused
him
to
turn
to
veterinary
medicine
eight
years
ago
he
fought
the
spasms
back
as
he
approached
the
table
and
made
the
external
examination
icterus
and
a
swollen
abdomenthe
rest
was
essentially
normal
and
he
knew
with
cold
certainty
that
he
could
not
lay
a
scalpel
edge
upon
that
cold
flesh
it
was
too
human
too
like
his
own
are
you
ready
doctor
the
lani
standing
across
the
table
from
him
asked
shall
i
expose
the
viscera
kennons
stomach
froze
of
course
he
should
have
realized
no
pathologist
did
his
own
dissection
he
examined
and
that
he
could
do
it
was
the
tactile
not
the
visual
sensations
that
upset
him
he
nodded
the
abdominal
viscera
first
he
said
the
lani
laid
back
the
skin
and
musculature
with
bold
sure
strokes
an
excellent
prosectress
kennon
thought
kennon
pointed
at
the
swollen
liver
and
the
lani
deftly
severed
its
attachments
and
laid
the
organ
out
for
inspection
the
cause
of
death
was
obvious
the
youngster
had
succumbed
to
a
massive
liverfluke
infestation
it
was
the
worst
he
had
ever
seen
the
bile
ducts
were
thick
calcified
and
choked
with
literally
thousands
of
the
graygreen
leafshaped
trematodes
lets
look
at
the
others
he
said
two
more
postmortems
confirmed
the
diagnosis
except
for
minor
differences
the
lesions
were
identical
he
removed
a
few
of
the
flukes
and
set
them
aside
for
further
study
well
thats
that
he
said
you
can
clean
up
now
he
had
found
the
criminal
and
now
the
problem
assumed
the
fascinating
qualities
of
a
crime
hunt
now
he
must
act
to
prevent
further
murders
to
reconstruct
the
crime
to
find
the
modus
operandi
to
track
the
fluke
to
its
source
and
to
execute
it
before
it
could
do
more
harm
photographs
and
tridis
would
have
to
be
taken
the
parasite
would
have
to
be
identified
and
its
sensitivity
to
therapy
determined
studies
would
have
to
be
made
on
its
life
cycle
and
the
means
by
which
it
gained
entrance
to
its
host
it
wouldnt
be
simple
because
this
trematode
was
probably
hepatodirus
hominis
and
it
was
tricky
it
adapted
like
the
species
it
parasitized
kennon
leaned
back
from
the
microscope
and
studied
the
illustrations
in
the
parasitology
text
no
matter
how
much
hepatodirus
changed
its
life
cycle
it
could
not
change
its
adult
form
the
arrangements
of
the
suckers
and
genital
structures
were
typical
old
docs
library
on
parasites
was
too
inadequate
for
more
than
diagnosis
he
would
have
to
wait
for
his
own
books
to
be
uncrated
before
he
could
do
more
than
apply
symptomatic
treatment
he
sighed
and
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
tomorrow
was
going
to
be
a
busy
day
the
door
opened
behind
mm
and
copper
slipped
quietly
into
the
office
she
looked
at
him
curiously
a
faint
halfshy
smile
on
her
face
what
is
it
kennon
asked
are
you
ready
to
fill
out
the
autopsy
protocol
its
customary
its
also
customary
to
knock
on
a
door
before
entering
is
it
old
doc
never
mentioned
it
im
not
old
doc
no
youre
not
she
admitted
youre
much
youngerand
far
more
beautiful
old
doc
was
a
fat
gray
old
man
she
paused
and
eyed
kennon
appraisingly
with
a
look
on
her
pointed
face
that
was
the
virtual
twin
of
eloises
i
think
ill
like
working
for
you
if
youre
as
nice
as
you
are
pretty
you
dont
call
a
man
beautiful
or
pretty
kennon
exploded
why
not
it
just
isnt
done
youre
a
funny
human
she
said
i
called
old
doc
beautiful
and
he
didnt
mind
thats
different
he
was
an
old
man
what
difference
does
that
make
i
dont
like
it
kennon
said
hitting
on
the
perfect
answer
she
stiffened
im
sorry
doctor
i
wont
do
it
again
she
looked
down
at
him
head
cocked
sideways
i
guess
i
have
a
lot
to
learn
about
you
youre
much
different
from
old
doc
he
didnt
snap
at
me
she
paused
for
a
moment
then
drew
a
deep
breath
kennon
blinked
about
that
report
she
said
regulations
require
that
each
postmortem
be
reported
promptly
and
that
a
record
of
the
lani
concerned
be
posted
in
the
death
book
together
with
all
pertinent
autopsy
data
man
blalok
is
very
fussy
about
proper
records
she
drew
one
of
the
chairs
to
a
spot
beside
the
desk
and
sat
down
crossed
her
long
legs
and
waited
expectantly
kennons
mouth
was
suddenly
dry
this
situation
was
impossible
how
in
the
name
of
sir
arthur
fleming
could
he
dictate
a
coldly
precise
report
with
a
naked
redhead
sitting
beside
him
look
he
said
i
wont
need
you
i
can
operate
a
voicewriter
you
can
pick
up
the
material
later
and
transcribe
it
her
face
fell
you
dont
like
me
she
said
her
green
eyes
filling
with
quick
tears
old
doc
never
oh
damn
old
doc
kennon
snapped
and
stop
that
snivelingor
get
out
better
yetget
out
and
stop
sniveling
she
leaped
to
her
feet
and
fled
kennon
swore
there
was
no
reason
for
him
to
act
that
way
he
had
been
more
brutal
than
necessary
but
the
girlno
the
laniwas
disconcerting
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
he
had
behaved
like
a
primitive
rather
than
a
member
of
one
of
the
oldest
human
civilizations
in
the
galaxy
he
wouldnt
bark
at
a
dog
that
way
he
shook
his
head
probably
he
was
tired
certainly
he
was
irritable
and
unclad
females
virtually
indistinguishable
from
human
werent
the
most
soothing
objects
to
contemplate
he
wondered
if
his
exasperation
was
real
or
merely
a
defense
mechanism
first
eloise
and
then
this
confound
it
he
was
surrounded
he
felt
trapped
and
it
wasnt
because
hed
been
away
from
women
too
long
a
week
was
hardly
that
he
grinned
as
he
recalled
the
blonde
from
thule
aboard
the
starship
now
there
was
a
woman
even
though
her
ears
were
pointed
and
her
arms
were
too
long
she
didnt
pressure
a
man
she
let
him
make
the
advances
he
grinned
that
was
it
he
was
on
the
defensive
he
was
the
one
who
was
being
pursuedand
his
male
ego
had
revolted
he
shrugged
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
autopsy
report
but
it
was
hopeless
he
couldnt
concentrate
he
jotted
a
few
notes
and
dropped
them
on
the
desktomorrow
would
be
time
enough
what
he
needed
now
was
a
stiff
drink
and
eight
hours
sleep
chapter
vii
kennon
stopped
at
blaloks
house
long
enough
to
tell
the
superintendent
what
was
causing
the
trouble
blalok
scowled
weve
never
had
flukes
here
before
he
said
why
should
they
appear
now
theyve
been
introduced
kennon
said
the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
how
dr
williamson
missed
them
the
old
man
was
senile
blalok
said
he
was
nearly
blind
the
last
six
months
of
his
life
i
wouldnt
doubt
that
he
let
his
assistants
do
most
of
his
work
and
they
could
have
missed
them
possibly
but
the
lesions
are
easy
to
see
at
any
rate
the
culprit
is
known
now
culprit
hepatodirus
hoministhe
human
liver
fluke
hes
a
tricky
little
fellowtravels
almost
as
far
as
men
do
im
glad
its
your
problem
not
mine
all
i
can
remember
about
flukes
is
that
theyre
hard
to
eradicate
particularly
h
hominis
you
can
tell
me
about
it
later
right
now
mr
alexanders
over
at
oldyour
house
probably
hes
looking
for
you
wheres
jordan
he
went
up
to
station
fourteen
well
see
him
tomorrow
ill
say
good
night
then
kennon
said
im
glad
youre
here
its
a
load
off
my
shoulders
see
you
tomorrow
blalok
waved
a
friendly
good
night
and
left
the
lights
on
long
enough
for
kennon
to
make
his
way
to
his
quarters
alexander
was
seated
in
a
heavily
upholstered
chair
listening
to
a
taped
symphony
in
the
stereo
his
eyes
half
closed
an
expression
of
peace
on
his
face
an
elderly
lani
stood
beside
him
it
was
a
comfortable
picture
the
humanoid
saw
kennon
and
gasped
a
tiny
indrawn
sound
of
surprise
alexanders
eyes
snapped
open
ohits
you
he
said
dont
worry
karaits
your
new
doctor
kara
smiled
you
startled
me
she
said
i
was
dreaming
on
your
feet
alexander
interjected
idly
i
should
have
known
you
at
once
doctor
theres
talk
about
you
all
over
the
yards
ever
since
you
arrived
they
know
what
is
going
on
around
here
better
than
any
of
us
alexander
chuckled
the
grapevine
is
amazingly
efficient
wellwhats
the
story
liver
fluke
hmmnot
good
i
think
it
can
be
stopped
i
looked
at
the
records
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
been
here
too
long
i
hope
youre
right
how
long
will
it
take
several
months
maybe
a
year
maybe
more
i
cant
say
but
ill
try
to
clean
it
up
as
quickly
as
possible
im
pretty
sure
of
the
fluke
and
its
a
hard
one
to
control
hepatodirus
kennon
nodded
thats
an
offworld
parasite
isnt
it
yes
it
originated
on
santos
parasitized
the
varl
originally
but
liked
humans
better
its
adapted
to
a
hundred
different
planetary
environments
and
it
keeps
spreading
its
a
real
cutiealmost
intelligent
the
way
it
behaves
but
it
can
be
licked
goodget
on
it
right
away
im
starting
tomorrow
finei
thought
youd
be
the
right
man
kara
fix
the
doctor
a
drink
we
might
as
well
have
a
nightcapthen
ill
go
back
to
the
house
and
listen
to
henry
and
annes
screams
about
poor
mistreated
douglas
and
then
back
to
albertsville
tomorrow
duty
and
the
credits
call
with
mild
surprise
kennon
realized
that
alexander
was
drunk
not
obnoxiously
but
enough
to
change
his
character
intoxicated
he
was
a
friendlier
person
if
there
was
any
truth
in
the
ancient
cliche
about
alcohol
bringing
out
a
mans
true
character
then
alexander
was
basically
a
very
nice
person
indeed
wellheres
your
home
for
the
next
five
years
alexander
said
eight
rooms
two
baths
a
freshener
and
three
lani
to
keep
the
place
running
youve
got
it
made
perhapswell
see
when
we
tackle
this
fluke
infestation
personally
i
dont
think
im
going
to
have
an
easy
time
tomorrow
im
going
to
be
up
to
my
neck
in
trouble
trying
to
save
your
profits
youll
do
it
i
have
confidence
in
you
i
still
think
you
should
have
hired
a
medic
this
isnt
all
of
your
job
alexander
said
and
besides
i
cant
afford
to
do
it
ohnot
the
money
but
it
might
be
admitting
that
the
lani
might
be
human
and
weve
gone
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
prove
theyre
not
he
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
theres
a
story
behind
this
i
wouldnt
doubt
it
maybe
itd
be
better
if
i
told
it
it
goes
back
over
four
centuries
grandfather
was
a
clever
man
after
he
had
secured
this
island
he
became
worried
about
the
surviving
lani
he
didnt
want
to
be
accused
of
genocide
since
the
lani
were
so
human
in
appearance
so
he
had
his
medical
officer
make
a
few
autopsies
the
md
reported
that
while
there
was
similarity
the
lani
were
probably
not
human
that
was
enough
for
grandfather
he
requested
a
court
of
inquiry
the
court
was
sitting
in
halsey
and
the
hearing
was
private
even
so
it
leaked
and
grandfather
was
highly
unpopular
for
a
time
until
the
lab
reports
came
in
it
cost
him
over
eight
hundred
ems
and
nearly
two
years
time
to
finish
the
case
but
when
it
was
over
the
lani
were
declared
alien
and
grandfather
had
ironclad
discovery
rights
they
really
put
him
through
the
mill
grandfather
furnished
the
bodies
and
three
courtappointed
mos
went
through
them
with
microscopes
they
didnt
miss
a
thing
their
reports
are
so
detailed
that
theyre
classics
of
their
kind
theyre
almost
required
reading
for
anyone
who
wants
to
learn
lani
structure
and
function
the
court
rendered
an
interim
decision
that
the
lani
were
nonhuman
and
armed
with
this
grandfather
prepared
the
final
tests
which
were
run
by
a
team
of
courtappointed
medics
and
biologists
who
made
in
vitro
and
live
tests
on
a
number
of
lani
female
prisoners
the
tests
ran
for
over
two
years
and
were
totally
negative
so
the
alexander
family
acquired
flora
and
the
otpens
and
a
legal
status
alexander
stood
up
wellthats
a
capsule
summary
the
records
are
in
the
library
if
youd
care
to
check
them
why
just
to
prove
were
honest
he
moved
carefully
toward
the
door
opened
it
and
disappeared
into
the
night
silently
kennon
watched
him
descend
the
porch
steps
he
seemed
steady
enough
for
a
moment
kennon
debated
whether
he
should
see
him
homeand
then
decided
against
it
if
alexander
needed
help
hed
have
asked
for
it
as
it
was
it
was
better
to
leave
things
alone
certainly
he
didnt
know
alexander
well
enough
to
act
as
a
guardian
he
turned
back
to
the
living
area
the
stereo
was
playing
something
soft
and
nostalgic
as
kennon
sank
into
the
chair
alexander
had
vacated
he
let
his
body
relax
it
had
been
as
full
a
day
as
he
had
ever
spent
filled
with
changes
so
abrupt
that
they
were
exhausting
he
felt
confused
there
were
no
precedents
he
could
apply
neither
his
studies
nor
his
travels
had
prepared
him
for
living
in
a
situation
like
this
legally
and
biologically
the
lani
werent
human
but
they
were
intelligent
upright
bipedal
mammals
whose
morphology
was
so
close
to
mans
that
it
had
taken
the
ultimate
test
to
settle
their
status
and
being
a
betan
kennon
was
suspicious
of
the
accuracy
of
that
ultimate
test
but
the
brotherhood
of
man
was
based
upon
it
the
feeling
of
unity
that
pervaded
mankinds
expanding
empire
was
its
product
from
almost
the
beginning
of
mankinds
leap
to
the
stars
it
had
been
recognized
that
men
must
help
each
other
or
perish
the
spirit
of
cooperation
against
the
common
enmity
of
alien
worlds
and
cultures
transcended
the
old
petty
rivalries
on
earth
menall
menwere
brothers
in
arms
and
so
the
brotherhood
was
bornand
the
concept
born
of
necessity
developed
its
muscles
in
a
thousand
battles
on
a
thousand
hostile
worlds
and
ultimately
it
evolved
into
the
only
form
of
central
authority
that
men
would
accept
yet
basically
it
was
not
a
government
it
was
an
attitude
of
mind
men
accepted
its
decisions
as
they
would
accept
the
rulings
of
a
family
council
and
for
the
same
reasons
the
brotherhood
laid
down
certain
rules
but
it
did
not
attempt
to
enforce
them
after
all
it
didnt
need
to
it
also
arbitrated
disputes
admitted
new
worlds
to
membership
and
organized
concerted
human
effort
against
dangerous
enemies
and
that
was
all
yet
in
its
sphere
the
authority
of
the
brotherhood
was
absolute
there
was
only
one
criterion
for
membership
in
the
brotherhoodmembership
in
the
human
race
no
matter
how
decadent
or
primitive
a
population
might
be
if
it
was
human
it
was
automatically
eligible
for
brotherhooda
free
and
equal
partner
in
the
society
of
human
worlds
kennon
doubted
that
any
nonhuman
race
had
ever
entered
the
select
circle
of
humanity
although
individuals
might
have
done
so
a
docked
lani
for
instance
would
probably
pass
unquestioned
as
a
human
but
the
lani
race
would
not
in
consequence
they
and
their
world
were
fair
prey
and
had
been
attacked
and
subjugated
of
course
proof
of
inhumanity
was
seldom
a
problem
most
alien
life
forms
were
obviously
alien
but
there
were
a
fewlike
the
laniwhere
similarities
were
so
close
that
it
was
impossible
to
determine
their
status
on
the
basis
of
morphology
alone
and
so
the
humanity
test
had
come
into
being
essentially
it
was
based
upon
species
compatibilityon
the
concept
that
like
can
interbreed
with
like
tests
conducted
on
every
inhabited
world
in
the
brotherhood
had
proven
this
conclusively
whatever
changes
had
taken
place
in
the
somatic
characteristics
of
mankind
since
the
exodus
they
had
not
altered
the
compatibility
of
human
germ
plasm
man
could
interbreed
with
manaliens
could
not
the
test
was
simple
the
results
were
observable
and
what
was
more
important
everyone
could
understand
it
no
definition
of
humanity
could
be
more
simple
or
direct
but
was
it
accurate
like
other
betans
kennon
wondered
it
wasso
farprobably
the
qualifying
phrases
were
those
of
the
scientist
that
strange
breed
that
refuses
to
accept
anything
as
an
established
fact
until
it
is
proven
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
after
all
the
human
race
had
been
spaceborne
for
only
six
thousand
yearsscarcely
time
for
any
real
differences
to
develop
but
physical
changes
had
already
appearedand
it
would
only
be
a
question
of
time
before
these
would
probably
be
followed
by
genetic
changes
and
in
some
groups
the
changes
might
be
extensive
enough
to
make
them
genetic
strangers
to
the
rest
of
humanity
what
would
happen
then
no
one
knew
actually
no
one
bothered
to
think
about
it
except
for
a
few
farseeing
men
who
worried
as
they
saw
probably
might
possibly
if
four
words
but
because
of
them
the
betans
were
slowly
withdrawing
from
the
rest
of
humanity
already
the
radiations
of
betas
variantg
sun
had
produced
changes
in
the
population
little
things
like
tougher
epidermis
and
depilation
of
body
hairlittle
things
that
held
alarming
implications
to
betas
scientists
and
to
betas
people
not
too
many
generations
hence
a
betan
outside
his
home
system
would
be
a
rarity
and
in
a
few
millennia
the
betan
system
itself
would
be
a
closed
enclave
peopled
by
humans
who
had
deviated
too
far
from
the
basic
stock
to
mingle
with
it
in
safety
of
course
the
brotherhood
itself
might
be
changed
by
that
time
but
there
was
no
assurance
that
this
would
happen
and
mankind
had
a
history
of
dealing
harshly
with
its
mutants
so
beta
would
play
it
safe
kennon
wondered
if
there
were
other
worlds
in
the
brotherhood
that
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
possibly
there
were
and
possibly
there
were
worlds
where
marked
deviations
had
occurred
there
wasnt
a
year
that
passed
that
didnt
bring
some
new
human
world
into
the
brotherhood
and
many
of
these
had
developed
from
that
cultural
explosion
during
the
first
millennium
known
as
the
exodus
where
small
groups
of
colonists
in
inadequate
ships
set
out
for
unannounced
goals
to
homestead
new
worlds
for
man
some
of
these
survived
and
many
were
being
discovered
even
at
this
late
date
but
so
far
none
had
any
difficulty
in
proving
their
human
origin
the
lani
conceivably
could
have
been
descendants
of
one
of
these
groups
which
probably
explained
the
extreme
care
the
brotherhood
courts
had
taken
with
their
case
but
they
had
failed
the
test
and
were
declared
animals
yet
it
was
possible
that
they
had
mutated
beyond
genetic
compatibility
if
they
had
and
if
it
were
proved
here
was
a
test
case
that
could
rock
the
galaxythat
could
shake
the
brotherhood
to
its
very
foundationsthat
could
force
a
reevaluation
of
the
criteria
of
humanity
kennon
grinned
he
was
a
fine
employee
here
he
was
less
than
a
full
day
on
the
job
dreaming
how
he
could
ruin
his
employer
shake
the
foundation
of
human
civilization
and
force
ten
thousand
billion
humans
to
change
their
comfortable
habit
patterns
and
their
belief
in
the
unchangeable
sameness
of
men
he
was
he
reflected
wryly
an
incurable
romantic
chapter
viii
wake
up
doctor
its
six
am
a
pleasant
voice
cut
through
kennons
slumber
he
opened
one
eye
and
looked
at
the
room
for
a
moment
the
strange
surroundings
bothered
him
then
memory
took
over
he
stirred
uncomfortably
looking
for
the
owner
of
the
voice
you
have
your
morning
calls
at
seven
and
theres
a
full
day
ahead
the
voice
went
on
im
sorry
sir
but
you
should
get
up
the
voice
didnt
sound
particularly
sorry
it
was
behind
him
kennon
decided
he
rolled
over
with
a
groan
of
protest
and
looked
at
his
tormentor
a
gasp
of
dismay
left
his
lips
for
standing
beside
the
bed
a
half
smile
on
her
pointed
face
was
copperlooking
fresh
and
alert
and
as
disturbing
as
ever
it
wasnt
right
kennon
thought
bitterly
to
be
awakened
from
a
sound
sleep
by
a
naked
humanoid
who
looked
too
human
for
comfort
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
im
supposed
to
be
here
copper
said
im
your
secretary
she
grinned
and
flexed
a
few
curves
of
her
torso
kennon
was
silent
is
there
anything
wrong
she
asked
for
a
moment
kennon
was
tempted
to
tell
her
what
was
wrongbut
he
held
his
tongue
she
probably
wouldnt
understand
but
there
was
one
thing
hed
better
settle
right
now
now
look
here
young
lady
he
began
im
not
a
lady
copper
interrupted
before
he
could
continue
ladies
are
human
im
a
lani
all
right
kennon
growled
lani
or
human
who
cares
but
do
you
have
to
break
into
a
mans
bedroom
and
wake
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
didnt
break
in
she
said
and
it
isnt
the
middle
of
the
night
its
morning
all
rightso
its
morning
and
you
didnt
break
in
then
how
in
halsteads
sacred
name
did
you
get
here
i
sleep
next
door
she
said
jerking
a
thumb
in
the
direction
of
an
open
door
in
the
side
wall
ive
been
there
ever
since
you
dismissed
me
last
night
she
explained
the
explanation
left
kennon
cold
the
old
cliche
about
doing
as
the
santosians
do
flicked
through
his
mind
well
perhaps
he
would
in
timebut
not
yet
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
couldnt
be
overturned
overnight
now
you
have
awakened
me
he
said
perhaps
youll
get
out
of
here
why
i
want
to
get
dressed
ill
help
you
you
will
not
im
perfectly
capable
of
taking
care
of
myself
ive
been
dressing
myself
for
years
im
not
used
to
people
helping
me
mywhat
a
strange
world
you
must
come
from
havent
you
ever
had
a
lani
before
no
you
poor
man
her
voice
was
curiously
pitying
no
one
to
make
you
feel
like
the
gods
no
one
to
serve
you
no
one
to
even
scrub
your
back
thats
enough
kennon
said
i
can
scrub
my
own
back
howyou
cant
reach
it
kennon
groaned
werent
there
any
lani
on
your
world
no
no
wonder
you
left
it
it
must
be
quite
primitive
primitive
kennons
voice
was
outraged
beta
has
one
of
the
highest
civilizations
in
the
brotherhood
but
you
dont
have
lani
she
said
patiently
so
you
must
be
primitive
halstead
fleming
and
ochsner
kennon
swore
do
you
believe
that
naturally
isnt
it
obvious
you
cant
possibly
be
civilized
unless
you
take
responsibility
for
intelligent
life
other
than
your
own
race
until
you
face
up
to
your
responsibilities
you
are
merely
a
member
of
a
dominant
race
not
a
civilized
one
kennons
reply
caught
in
his
throat
his
eyes
widened
as
he
looked
at
her
and
what
he
was
about
to
say
remained
unspoken
out
of
the
mouths
of
humanoids
he
muttered
oddly
what
does
that
mean
copper
asked
forget
it
kennon
said
wildly
leave
me
alone
go
put
on
some
clothes
you
embarrass
me
ill
go
copper
said
but
youll
have
to
be
embarrassed
only
household
lani
wear
cloth
she
frowned
two
vertical
furrows
dividing
her
dark
brows
ive
never
understood
why
inhouse
lani
have
to
be
disfigured
that
way
but
i
suppose
theres
some
reason
for
it
men
seldom
do
anything
without
a
reason
kennon
shook
his
head
either
she
was
grossly
ignorant
which
he
doubted
or
she
was
conditioned
to
the
eyeballs
the
latter
was
more
probable
but
even
that
was
doubtful
her
trenchant
remark
about
civilization
wasnt
the
product
of
a
conditioned
mind
but
why
was
he
worrying
about
her
attitudes
they
werent
importantshe
wasnt
even
human
he
shook
his
head
that
was
a
sophistry
the
fact
that
she
wasnt
human
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
importance
of
her
attitude
i
suppose
there
is
a
reason
he
agreed
but
i
dont
know
it
i
havent
been
here
long
enough
to
know
anything
about
such
things
she
nodded
that
does
make
a
difference
she
admitted
many
new
men
are
bothered
at
first
by
the
fact
that
we
lani
are
naked
but
they
adjust
quickly
so
will
you
she
smiled
as
she
turned
away
you
see
she
added
over
her
shoulder
as
she
left
the
room
were
not
human
were
just
another
of
your
domestic
animals
was
there
laughter
in
her
voice
kennon
wasnt
sure
his
sigh
was
composed
of
equal
parts
of
relief
and
exasperation
as
he
slipped
out
of
bed
and
began
to
dress
hed
forgo
the
shower
this
morning
he
had
no
desire
for
copper
to
appear
and
offer
to
scrub
his
back
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
couldnt
take
it
possibly
hed
get
used
to
it
in
time
perhaps
he
might
even
like
it
but
right
now
he
wasnt
acclimatized
man
blalok
called
copper
said
as
she
removed
the
breakfast
dishes
he
said
that
hed
be
right
over
to
pick
you
up
he
wants
to
show
you
the
operation
when
did
he
call
about
ten
minutes
ago
i
told
him
that
you
were
at
breakfast
he
said
hed
wait
she
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
theres
a
nightmare
quality
to
this
kennon
muttered
as
he
slipped
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
his
tunic
and
closed
the
seam
tabs
i
have
the
feeling
that
im
going
to
wake
up
any
minute
he
looked
at
his
reflection
in
the
dresser
mirror
and
his
reflection
looked
worriedly
back
this
whole
thing
has
an
air
of
plausible
unreality
the
advertisement
the
contract
this
impossible
island
that
raises
humanoids
as
part
of
the
livestock
he
shrugged
and
his
mirrored
image
shrugged
back
but
its
real
all
right
no
dream
could
possibly
be
this
detailed
i
wonder
how
im
going
to
take
it
for
the
next
five
years
probably
not
too
well
he
mused
silently
already
im
talking
to
myself
without
even
trying
that
lani
copper
can
make
me
feel
like
a
sarkian
he
nodded
at
his
image
the
sarkian
analogy
was
almost
perfect
he
decided
for
on
that
grimly
backward
world
females
were
as
close
to
slaves
as
the
brotherhood
would
permit
raised
from
birth
under
an
iron
regimen
designed
to
produce
complaisant
mates
for
the
dominant
males
probably
that
was
the
reason
sark
was
so
backward
the
men
having
achieved
domestic
tranquillity
had
no
desire
to
do
anything
that
would
disturb
the
status
quo
and
since
no
sarkian
woman
under
any
conceivable
circumstances
would
annoy
her
lordly
master
with
demands
to
produce
better
mousetraps
household
gadgetry
and
more
money
the
technological
development
of
sark
had
come
to
a
virtual
standstill
it
took
two
sexes
to
develop
a
civilization
kennon
shrugged
worlds
developed
as
they
did
because
people
were
as
they
were
and
while
passing
judgment
was
still
a
major
human
pursuit
no
native
of
one
world
had
a
right
to
force
his
customs
down
the
unwilling
throat
of
another
it
would
be
better
to
accept
his
present
situation
and
live
with
it
rather
than
trying
to
impose
his
betan
conception
of
morality
upon
lani
that
neither
understood
nor
appreciated
it
his
business
was
to
treat
and
prevent
animal
disease
what
happened
to
the
animals
before
infection
or
after
recovery
was
none
of
his
affair
that
was
a
matter
between
alexander
and
his
conscience
blalok
was
waiting
for
him
sitting
behind
the
wheel
of
a
square
boxy
vehicle
that
squatted
with
an
air
of
unpolished
efficiency
on
the
graveled
drive
behind
his
house
he
smiled
a
quick
greeting
as
kennon
approached
its
about
time
you
showed
up
he
said
youll
have
to
get
into
the
habit
of
rising
early
on
this
place
we
do
most
of
our
work
early
in
the
morning
and
late
in
the
afternoon
during
the
day
its
too
hot
to
breathe
let
alone
work
well
lets
get
going
theres
still
time
to
visit
the
outer
stations
kennon
climbed
in
and
blalok
started
the
vehicle
i
thought
wed
take
a
jeep
today
he
said
they
arent
very
pretty
but
they
get
around
he
turned
onto
the
surfaced
road
that
ran
down
the
hill
toward
the
hospital
and
the
complex
of
redroofed
buildings
clustered
about
it
about
those
flukes
he
said
you
have
any
plans
to
get
rid
of
them
not
yet
ill
have
to
look
the
place
over
theres
more
detective
work
than
medicine
involved
in
this
detective
work
surewe
know
the
criminal
but
to
squelch
him
we
have
to
learn
his
hangouts
study
his
modus
operandi
and
learn
how
to
make
his
victims
secure
from
his
activities
unless
we
do
that
we
can
treat
individuals
from
now
to
infinity
and
all
well
have
is
more
cases
we
have
to
apply
modern
criminology
tacticseliminate
the
source
of
crimestop
up
the
soft
spots
in
other
words
kill
the
flukes
before
they
enter
the
lani
old
doc
never
said
anything
about
this
blalok
said
probably
he
never
knew
about
it
i
was
looking
over
the
herd
books
last
night
and
i
saw
nothing
about
trematodes
or
anything
that
looked
like
a
parasite
pattern
until
the
last
few
months
why
not
my
guess
is
that
he
was
one
of
the
first
deaths
you
mean
this
thing
attacks
human
beings
preferentially
kennon
said
its
strange
too
because
it
originated
on
santos
so
far
as
we
know
in
fact
some
people
think
that
the
varl
bred
it
for
a
weapon
to
use
against
us
before
we
conquered
them
they
could
have
done
it
their
biological
science
was
of
a
high
enough
order
but
how
did
it
get
here
i
wouldnt
knowunless
youve
hired
a
santosian
or
someone
else
who
was
affected
we
did
have
a
man
from
santos
fellow
called
joe
kryla
we
had
to
let
him
go
because
he
was
a
nudist
it
made
a
bad
impression
on
the
lani
but
that
was
over
a
year
ago
thats
about
the
right
time
to
build
up
a
good
reservoir
of
infection
the
fatal
cases
usually
dont
show
up
before
an
area
is
pretty
well
seeded
thats
not
so
good
well
theres
one
thing
in
our
favor
the
lani
are
pretty
well
concentrated
into
groups
and
so
far
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
infestation
outside
of
hillside
stationexcept
for
two
deaths
in
lani
recently
sent
from
there
if
we
quarantine
those
stations
and
work
fast
may
be
we
can
stop
this
before
it
spreads
all
over
the
island
thats
fine
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
treat
those
that
show
symptoms
there
should
be
some
trematox
capsules
at
the
hospital
if
there
arent
well
get
them
well
take
the
sick
ones
back
to
the
hospital
area
and
push
therapy
and
supportive
treatment
now
that
we
know
the
cause
we
shouldnt
have
any
more
death
losses
old
doc
didnt
treat
at
the
hospital
blalok
said
im
not
old
doc
but
its
going
to
mess
up
our
operations
were
using
the
ward
buildings
to
finish
training
the
lani
scheduled
for
market
why
its
convenient
most
of
the
ward
space
is
filled
right
now
blalok
said
there
was
a
touch
of
disgust
in
his
voice
theyre
well
arent
they
kennon
demanded
of
course
then
get
them
out
of
there
but
i
told
you
you
told
me
nothing
the
hospital
area
is
needed
for
something
more
than
a
training
center
perhaps
old
doc
was
trained
in
outcall
work
but
im
not
i
work
from
a
hospital
the
only
things
i
do
on
outcalls
are
diagnoses
vaccinations
and
emergencies
the
rest
of
the
patients
come
to
the
hospital
this
isnt
going
to
set
well
with
jordan
and
the
division
chiefs
thats
not
my
concern
kennon
said
i
run
my
business
in
the
best
way
possible
the
patients
are
of
more
concern
than
the
personal
comfort
of
any
straw
boss
or
administrator
youre
the
administratoryou
calm
them
down
you
have
the
authority
blalok
admitted
but
my
advice
to
you
is
to
go
slow
i
cant
kennon
said
not
if
we
want
to
prevent
any
more
losses
there
simply
wont
be
time
to
run
all
over
the
island
dosing
with
trematox
and
taking
temperatures
and
while
that
sort
of
thing
is
routine
it
should
be
supervised
besides
youll
see
the
advantages
of
this
method
soon
enough
i
hope
so
blalok
said
as
he
braked
the
jeep
to
a
stop
in
front
of
the
hospital
i
suppose
youll
want
to
take
some
things
along
so
i
will
kennon
said
ill
be
back
in
a
minute
kennon
slid
from
the
seat
leaving
blalok
looking
peculiarly
at
his
departing
back
the
minute
stretched
to
nearly
ten
before
kennon
returned
followed
by
two
lani
carrying
bags
which
they
loaded
into
the
back
of
the
jeep
i
had
to
reorganize
a
little
kennon
apologized
some
things
were
unfamiliar
plan
on
taking
them
blalok
said
jerking
a
thumb
at
the
two
lani
not
this
time
im
having
them
fit
up
an
ambulance
they
should
be
busy
most
of
the
day
blalok
grunted
and
started
the
turbine
he
moved
a
lever
and
the
jeep
floated
off
the
ground
an
airboat
too
kennon
remarked
i
wondered
why
this
rig
was
so
boxy
its
a
multipurpose
vehicle
blalok
said
we
need
them
around
here
for
fast
transport
most
of
the
roads
arent
so
good
he
engaged
the
drive
and
the
jeep
began
to
move
well
go
cross
country
he
said
hillsides
pretty
far
outthe
farthest
station
since
we
abandoned
olympus
the
air
began
whistling
past
the
boxlike
body
of
the
jeep
as
blalok
increased
the
power
to
the
drive
and
set
the
machine
on
automatic
well
get
a
pretty
good
crosssection
of
our
operations
on
this
trip
he
said
over
the
whine
of
the
turbine
look
down
there
they
were
passing
across
a
series
of
fenced
pastures
and
kennon
was
impressed
the
size
of
this
operation
was
beginning
to
sink
in
it
hadnt
looked
so
big
from
the
substratosphere
in
alexanders
ship
but
down
here
close
to
the
ground
it
was
enormous
fields
of
grain
wide
orchards
extensive
gardens
once
they
were
forced
to
detour
a
huge
supply
boat
that
rose
heavily
in
front
of
them
working
in
the
fields
were
dozens
of
brownskinned
lani
who
paused
to
look
up
and
wave
as
the
jeep
sped
by
occasional
clusters
of
farm
buildings
and
the
low
barrackslike
stations
appeared
and
disappeared
behind
them
theres
about
twenty
lani
at
each
of
these
stations
blalok
said
they
work
the
farm
area
under
the
direction
of
the
stationmaster
hes
a
farmer
of
course
usually
hes
a
graduate
of
an
agricultural
school
but
we
have
a
few
who
are
descendants
of
the
crew
of
the
first
alexander
and
theres
one
old
codger
who
was
actually
with
him
during
the
conquest
most
of
our
stationmasters
are
family
men
we
feel
that
a
wife
and
children
add
to
a
mans
stabilityand
incidentally
keep
him
from
fooling
around
with
the
lani
a
series
of
fenced
pastures
containing
hundreds
of
huge
grayishwhite
quadrupeds
slipped
past
cattle
kennon
asked
yesearth
strain
thats
why
theyre
so
big
we
also
have
sheep
and
swine
but
you
wont
see
them
on
this
run
any
native
animals
a
fewand
some
which
are
native
to
other
worlds
but
theyre
luxurytrade
items
the
big
sale
items
are
beef
pork
and
mutton
blalok
chuckled
did
you
think
that
the
lani
were
our
principal
export
kennon
nodded
theyre
only
a
drop
in
the
bucket
agricultureearthstyle
agricultureis
our
main
source
of
income
the
lani
are
valuable
principally
to
keep
down
the
cost
of
overhead
virtually
all
of
them
work
right
here
on
the
island
we
dont
sell
more
than
a
hundred
a
year
less
than
five
per
cent
of
our
total
and
those
are
surplustoo
light
or
too
delicate
for
farm
work
where
do
you
find
a
market
for
all
this
produce
kennon
asked
theres
two
hundred
million
people
here
and
quite
a
few
billion
more
in
spacetrain
range
we
can
produce
more
cheaply
than
any
competitor
and
we
can
undersell
any
competition
even
full
automation
blalok
chuckled
there
are
some
things
that
a
computer
cant
do
as
well
as
a
human
being
and
one
of
them
is
farm
the
foods
on
which
humanity
is
accustomed
to
feed
a
manll
pay
two
credits
for
a
steak
he
could
get
a
chlorella
substitute
for
half
a
credit
but
hell
still
buy
the
steak
if
he
can
afford
it
same
thing
goes
for
fruit
vegetables
grain
and
garden
truck
mans
eating
habits
have
only
changed
from
necessity
those
who
can
pay
will
still
pay
well
for
natural
foods
blalok
chuckled
weve
put
quite
a
dent
in
the
algae
and
synthetics
operations
in
this
sector
its
still
a
luxury
trade
kennon
said
youve
eaten
synthetic
blalok
replied
what
do
you
prefer
kennon
had
to
agree
that
blalok
was
right
he
too
liked
the
real
thing
far
better
than
its
imitations
if
its
this
profitable
then
why
sell
lani
kennon
asked
its
the
familys
idea
actuallysince
the
export
type
is
surplus
it
does
us
no
harm
we
keep
enough
for
servantsand
the
others
would
be
inefficient
for
most
farm
work
so
disposal
by
sale
is
a
logical
and
profitable
way
of
culling
but
now
the
bossman
is
being
pressured
into
breeding
an
export
type
and
this
i
dont
like
its
too
commercial
smells
like
slavery
youre
a
mystic
arent
you
kennon
asked
surebut
that
doesnt
mean
i
like
slavery
oh
i
know
some
of
those
fatheaded
brotherhood
economists
call
our
system
economic
slaveryand
ill
admit
that
its
pretty
hard
to
crack
out
of
a
spherical
trust
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
we
have
to
stay
where
we
are
mystics
arent
owned
by
their
entrepreneurs
sure
its
a
tough
haul
to
beat
the
boss
but
it
can
be
done
i
did
it
and
others
do
it
all
the
time
the
situation
isnt
hopeless
but
it
is
with
the
lani
kennon
added
of
course
thats
why
they
should
be
protected
what
chance
does
a
lani
have
without
us
they
cant
even
keep
going
as
a
race
theyre
technological
morons
they
dont
live
long
enough
to
understand
modern
civilization
to
turn
those
poor
helpless
humanoids
out
into
human
society
would
be
criminal
its
our
duty
to
protect
them
even
while
were
using
them
mans
burden
kennon
said
repeating
the
old
cliche
exactly
blalok
scowled
i
wish
i
had
guts
enough
to
give
the
bossman
the
factsbut
i
cant
get
nerve
enough
to
try
ive
a
good
job
herea
wife
and
two
kidsand
i
dont
want
to
jeopardize
my
future
blalok
glanced
over
the
side
well
here
we
are
he
said
and
began
descending
into
the
center
of
a
spokelike
mass
of
buildings
radiating
outward
from
a
central
hub
hmmbig
place
kennon
murmured
it
should
be
blalok
replied
it
furnishes
all
of
our
lani
for
replacement
and
export
it
can
turn
out
over
a
thousand
a
year
at
full
capacity
of
course
we
dont
run
at
that
rate
or
flora
would
be
overpopulated
but
this
is
a
big
layout
like
you
said
it
can
maintain
a
population
of
at
least
forty
thousand
old
alexander
had
big
ideas
i
wonder
what
he
planned
to
do
with
them
kennon
said
i
wouldnt
know
the
old
man
never
took
anyone
into
his
confidence
jordan
came
up
as
the
jeep
settled
to
the
ground
been
expecting
you
for
the
past
half
hour
he
said
your
office
said
you
were
on
your
waygood
to
see
you
too
doc
ive
been
going
over
the
records
with
hank
allworththe
stationmaster
here
jordan
held
out
his
hand
youre
an
earthman
eh
kennon
asked
as
he
grasped
the
outstretched
hand
the
gesture
was
as
old
as
man
its
ritualistic
meaning
lost
in
antiquity
nomarsborna
neighbor
world
jordan
said
but
our
customs
and
earths
are
the
same
youre
a
long
way
from
home
kennon
said
no
farther
than
you
doc
jordan
looked
uncomfortable
but
we
can
compare
origins
later
right
now
youd
better
come
into
the
office
ive
run
across
something
peculiar

ix
there
are
twelve
bays
to
this
station
jordan
said
under
our
present
setup
two
are
used
for
breeding
and
the
other
ten
for
maturation
we
rotate
the
youngsters
around
the
baya
different
bay
each
year
until
theyre
age
eleven
then
theyre
sorted
according
to
type
and
sent
out
for
a
year
of
further
specialized
training
after
which
they
go
onto
the
farms
or
to
inhouse
or
export
now
heres
the
peculiar
part
theres
no
trouble
in
bays
one
through
nine
but
bay
ten
has
had
all
our
losses
except
two
that
have
occurred
at
the
training
stations
thats
good
news
kennon
said
our
parasite
cant
have
had
time
to
migrate
too
far
we
have
him
pinpointed
unlesssay
how
many
training
centers
are
there
three
jordan
said
quarantine
them
kennon
replied
right
now
nothing
goes
in
or
out
until
weve
checked
them
and
completed
prophylaxis
jordan
looked
at
blalok
inquiringly
hes
the
boss
blalok
said
do
as
youre
told
this
is
his
problem
why
the
quarantine
jordan
asked
i
want
to
get
any
carriers
we
can
check
them
with
antigen
and
then
give
trematox
all
that
concentration
in
bay
ten
jordan
said
does
it
mean
something
blalok
said
that
there
was
a
santosian
in
your
division
yeahjoe
krylaand
come
to
think
of
it
he
ran
bay
ten
thats
a
helpnow
lets
see
what
makes
that
bay
different
from
the
others
why
ill
tell
youbut
you
may
not
understand
kennon
said
ill
take
a
chance
kennon
grinned
all
right
you
asked
for
it
the
parasite
thats
doing
the
damage
is
a
flatworm
a
trematode
called
hepatodirus
hominis
as
ive
told
blalok
its
a
tricky
thing
like
all
trematodes
it
has
a
threestage
life
cycle
but
unlike
every
other
fluke
its
life
cycle
is
not
fixed
to
definite
intermediate
hosts
depending
upon
where
it
is
the
fluke
adapts
it
still
must
pass
through
its
life
cycle
but
its
intermediate
host
need
not
be
one
species
of
snail
fish
or
copepod
any
coldblooded
host
will
do
what
you
have
here
is
a
kardonian
variant
which
has
adapted
to
some
particular
intermediate
host
on
this
world
until
now
its
final
host
was
either
man
or
varl
now
we
have
a
third
the
lani
and
apparently
they
are
the
most
susceptible
of
the
three
it
never
kills
varl
and
humans
while
theyre
more
susceptible
only
occasionally
succumb
but
the
lani
appear
to
be
the
most
susceptible
of
all
ive
never
seen
an
infestation
like
those
lani
had
their
livers
were
literally
crawling
with
flukes
kennon
paused
and
looked
at
jordan
you
following
me
he
asked
slowly
and
poorly
jordan
said
youre
assuming
too
much
knowledge
on
my
part
kennon
chuckled
you
cant
say
i
didnt
warn
you
wellim
really
interested
in
only
one
thinghow
do
you
break
the
parasite
up
in
business
theres
only
one
sure
wayand
thats
to
break
the
life
cycle
the
technique
is
thousands
of
years
old
but
its
just
as
good
today
as
it
was
then
goodthen
lets
do
it
to
make
a
varrit
stew
kennon
said
one
must
first
catch
the
varrit
huh
we
have
to
learn
the
beasties
life
cycle
before
we
can
break
it
and
like
i
said
it
adapts
its
intermediate
host
can
be
any
one
of
a
hundred
coldblooded
animals
is
there
no
place
else
where
it
can
be
attacked
sure
in
the
body
of
the
final
host
or
on
its
final
encysting
place
but
that
wont
eliminate
the
bug
why
not
itll
still
survive
in
its
infective
form
and
enough
lani
will
get
subacute
dosage
to
propagate
it
until
the
time
is
right
for
another
epizootic
we
have
to
kill
its
intermediate
hostor
hosts
if
it
has
more
than
one
that
will
keep
it
from
growing
and
will
ultimately
eradicate
it
judson
scratched
his
head
it
sounds
complicated
it
is
its
so
complicated
that
once
the
fluke
becomes
well
established
its
virtually
impossible
to
eradicate
and
you
think
it
can
be
done
here
we
can
give
it
the
old
college
try
but
its
going
to
take
some
detective
work
where
do
we
start
with
bay
ten
we
look
it
over
real
well
then
we
check
the
diet
and
habits
of
the
lani
then
we
check
each
individual
lani
then
we
check
the
life
cycle
of
the
parasite
somewhere
along
the
line
if
were
lucky
well
find
a
weak
point
that
can
be
attacked
thats
a
big
order
blalok
said
it
cant
be
helped
thats
the
way
it
is
of
course
were
lucky
that
were
on
an
isolated
land
mass
that
gives
us
an
advantage
we
should
be
able
to
clean
this
up
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
take
it
depends
on
how
well
the
fluke
is
established
six
months
at
the
minimumand
i
wouldnt
care
to
guess
at
the
maximum
however
i
hope
the
minimum
will
be
time
enough
so
do
i
blalok
said
well
kennon
said
lets
get
on
with
it
i
hope
it
wont
interrupt
our
program
jordan
said
of
course
it
will
interrupt
it
kennon
replied
it
cant
help
it
get
the
idea
in
your
head
that
youre
facing
something
here
that
can
cripple
youmaybe
abort
your
whole
operation
you
have
a
choiceinterrupt
now
or
abort
later
and
half
measures
wont
work
to
eradicate
this
pest
requires
an
allout
effort
but
i
cant
see
why
we
cant
merely
bypass
bay
ten
jordan
said
take
my
word
for
it
kennon
said
you
cant
theres
no
accurate
way
of
telling
how
far
this
spreads
until
the
death
losses
occur
our
tests
for
fluke
infestation
arent
that
good
we
have
to
work
thoroughly
and
carefully
we
cant
be
butting
heads
over
thiseither
we
all
cooperate
or
this
whole
operation
will
blow
up
in
our
faces
look
at
the
record
six
months
ago
you
ended
a
year
with
no
deaths
from
disease
five
months
ago
old
doc
and
two
lani
were
ill
four
months
ago
one
of
the
two
lani
was
dead
and
old
doc
was
too
ill
to
be
effective
three
months
ago
old
doc
and
the
other
lani
were
dead
and
before
the
end
of
the
month
two
more
followed
them
two
months
ago
six
died
last
month
eight
and
so
far
this
month
youve
lost
four
and
you
have
over
two
weeks
to
go
up
to
now
theyve
all
been
from
here
but
two
this
month
were
at
other
stations
in
six
months
if
nothing
is
done
well
be
having
losses
there
unless
were
lucky
and
the
losses
will
keep
on
increasing
apparently
you
dont
know
what
it
is
to
live
with
parasitesso
let
me
tell
you
it
isnt
pleasant
blalok
shrugged
you
neednt
get
hot
about
it
he
said
after
all
youre
the
docand
well
cooperate
jordan
nodded
we
will
he
said
all
the
way
chapter
x
there
is
a
special
providence
that
looks
over
recent
veterinary
graduates
kennon
reflected
as
he
checked
the
monthly
reports
from
the
stations
since
the
time
he
had
laid
down
the
law
to
judson
and
blalok
he
had
had
no
trouble
from
the
production
staff
and
for
the
past
four
months
there
had
been
no
further
trouble
with
hepatodirus
that
unwanted
visitor
had
apparently
been
evicted
at
that
they
had
been
lucky
the
parasite
had
been
concentrated
at
hillside
station
and
had
failed
to
establish
itself
in
the
training
area
the
intermediate
host
it
had
turned
out
was
a
small
amphibian
that
was
susceptible
to
commercial
insecticide
it
had
been
no
trouble
to
eradicate
systemic
treatment
and
cooking
of
all
food
had
cleaned
up
the
infective
cercaria
and
individual
infections
and
after
six
months
of
intensive
search
quarantine
and
investigation
kennon
was
morally
certain
that
the
disease
had
been
eradicated
the
last
four
reports
confirmed
his
belief
he
sighed
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
blalok
was
at
last
convinced
that
his
ideas
were
right
the
hospital
was
operating
as
a
hospital
should
with
a
staff
of
twelve
lani
kept
busy
checking
the
full
wards
actually
it
was
working
better
than
it
should
since
stationmasters
all
over
the
island
were
now
shipping
in
sick
animals
rather
than
treating
them
or
requesting
outpatient
service
hi
doc
blalok
said
as
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
looked
into
the
office
you
doing
anything
not
at
the
moment
kennon
said
something
troubling
you
nojust
thought
id
drop
in
for
a
moment
and
congratulate
you
for
what
for
surviving
the
first
year
that
wont
be
for
two
months
yet
blalok
shook
his
head
this
is
kardon
he
said
theres
only
three
hundred
and
two
days
in
our
year
ten
thirtyday
months
and
two
special
days
at
the
years
end
kennon
shrugged
my
contract
is
galactic
standard
i
still
have
two
months
to
go
but
how
come
the
tenmonth
year
most
other
planets
have
twelve
regardless
of
the
number
of
days
old
alexander
liked
thirtyday
months
ive
wondered
about
that
youll
find
a
lot
more
peculiar
things
about
flora
when
you
get
to
know
her
better
this
year
has
just
been
a
breakingin
period
kennon
chuckled
its
damn
near
broken
me
he
admitted
you
know
i
thought
that
the
lanid
be
my
principal
practice
when
i
came
here
you
didnt
figure
that
right
theyre
the
easiest
part
theyre
intelligent
and
cooperative
which
is
more
than
one
can
say
about
the
others
kennon
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
what
with
this
infernal
heat
and
their
eternal
stubbornness
ive
nearly
been
driven
crazy
you
shouldnt
have
laid
out
that
vaccination
program
i
had
to
your
hog
business
was
living
mostly
on
luck
and
the
sheep
and
shrakes
were
almost
as
bad
you
cant
get
away
from
soil
saprophytes
no
matter
how
clean
you
are
under
a
pasture
setup
theres
always
a
chance
of
contamination
and
that
old
cliche
about
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
truer
of
livestock
raising
than
anything
else
i
can
think
of
i
have
some
more
good
news
for
you
blalok
said
thats
why
i
came
over
were
going
to
have
another
species
to
treat
and
vaccinate
kennon
groaned
now
what
poultry
blaloks
voice
was
disgusted
personally
i
think
its
a
mess
but
alexander
thinks
its
profitable
someones
told
him
that
pound
for
pound
chickens
are
the
most
efficient
feed
converters
of
all
the
domestic
animals
so
were
getting
a
pilot
plant
eggs
incubator
and
a
knockeddown
broiler
battery
so
we
can
try
the
idea
out
the
bossman
is
always
hot
on
new
ideas
to
increase
efficiency
and
production
the
only
trouble
is
that
he
fails
to
consider
the
work
involved
in
setting
up
another
operation
youre
so
right
ill
have
to
brush
up
on
pullorum
ornithosis
coccidosis
leukosis
perosis
and
ochsner
knows
how
many
otherosises
anditises
i
was
never
too
strong
on
fowl
practice
in
school
and
id
be
happier
if
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
them
so
would
i
blalok
agreed
i
cant
see
anything
in
this
but
trouble
kennon
nodded
and
hes
forgotten
something
else
blalok
added
poultry
need
concentrated
feed
were
going
to
have
to
install
a
feed
mill
kennon
chuckled
i
hope
hell
appreciate
the
bill
he
gets
he
thinks
we
can
use
local
labor
blalok
said
gloomily
i
wish
hed
realize
that
lani
are
technological
morons
they
could
learn
i
suppose
sobut
it
isnt
easy
and
besides
allworth
is
the
only
man
with
feedmill
experience
and
hes
up
to
his
ears
with
hillside
station
since
that
expansion
order
came
in
i
never
did
get
the
reason
for
that
after
we
complained
about
the
slavery
implications
and
got
the
bossmans
okay
to
hold
the
line
why
do
we
need
more
lani
didnt
you
know
his
sisters
finally
decided
to
try
marriage
found
herself
some
overmuscled
halsite
who
looked
good
to
herbut
she
couldnt
crack
his
moral
barrier
blalok
grinned
i
thought
youd
be
the
first
to
know
wasnt
she
interested
in
you
kennon
chuckled
you
could
call
it
that
interestedlike
the
way
a
dogs
interested
in
a
beefsteak
its
a
good
thing
we
had
that
fluke
problem
or
id
have
been
chewed
up
and
digested
long
ago
that
woman
frightens
me
i
could
be
scared
by
uglier
things
blalok
said
with
the
bossmans
sister
on
my
side
i
wouldnt
worry
what
makes
you
think
shed
be
on
my
side
shes
a
cannibal
well
you
know
her
better
than
i
do
he
didhe
certainly
did
that
first
month
had
been
one
of
the
worst
he
had
ever
spent
kennon
reflected
between
eloise
and
the
flukes
he
had
nearly
collapsedand
when
it
had
come
to
the
final
showdown
he
thought
for
a
while
that
hed
be
looking
for
another
job
but
alexander
had
been
more
than
passably
understanding
and
had
refused
his
sisters
passionate
pleas
for
a
betan
scalp
he
owed
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
bossman
youre
lucky
you
never
knew
her
kennon
said
that
all
depends
on
what
you
mean
blalok
said
as
he
grinned
and
walked
to
the
door
the
parting
shot
missed
its
mark
entirely
as
kennon
looked
at
him
with
blank
incomprehension
you
should
have
been
a
mystic
blalok
said
a
knowledge
of
the
sacred
books
would
do
you
no
end
of
good
and
with
that
cryptic
remark
the
superintendent
vanished
that
had
all
the
elements
of
a
snide
remark
kennon
murmured
to
himself
but
my
educations
been
neglected
somewhere
along
the
line
i
dont
get
it
he
shrugged
and
buzzed
for
copper
the
veterinary
report
would
have
to
be
added
to
the
pile
already
before
him
and
the
bossman
liked
to
have
his
reports
on
time
copper
watched
kennon
as
he
dictated
the
covering
letter
her
slim
fingers
dancing
over
the
stenotype
he
had
been
here
a
full
yearbut
instead
of
becoming
a
familiar
object
he
had
grown
so
gigantic
that
he
filled
her
world
and
it
wasnt
merely
because
he
was
young
and
beautiful
he
was
kind
too
yet
she
couldnt
approach
him
and
she
wanted
to
so
desperately
that
it
was
a
physical
pain
other
lani
had
told
her
about
men
and
what
they
could
do
even
her
old
preceptress
at
hillside
station
had
given
her
some
advice
when
man
allworth
had
tattooed
the
tiny
v
on
her
thigh
that
meant
she
had
been
selected
for
the
veterinary
staff
and
when
old
doc
had
brought
her
from
the
training
station
to
the
hospital
and
removed
her
tail
she
was
certain
that
she
was
one
of
the
lucky
ones
who
would
know
love
but
love
wasnt
a
pain
in
the
chest
an
ache
in
the
belly
and
thighs
an
unfulfilled
longing
that
destroyed
sleep
and
made
food
tasteless
love
was
supposed
to
be
pleasant
and
exciting
she
could
remember
every
word
her
preceptress
had
spoken
my
little
one
the
old
lani
had
said
you
now
wear
the
doctors
mark
and
soon
no
one
will
be
able
to
tell
you
from
a
human
you
will
look
like
our
masters
you
will
share
in
their
work
and
there
may
be
times
when
you
will
find
favor
in
their
eyes
then
you
may
learn
of
love
love
the
old
voice
was
soft
in
coppers
ears
the
word
is
almost
a
stranger
to
us
now
known
only
to
the
few
who
serve
our
masters
it
was
not
always
so
the
old
ones
knew
love
before
man
alexander
came
and
our
young
were
the
fruit
of
love
rather
than
the
product
of
our
masters
cunning
but
you
may
know
the
flower
even
though
you
cannot
bear
its
fruit
you
may
enter
that
world
of
pleasurepain
the
old
ones
knew
that
world
which
is
now
denied
us
but
remember
always
that
you
are
a
lani
a
man
may
be
kind
to
you
he
may
treat
you
gently
he
may
show
you
love
yet
you
never
will
be
his
equal
nor
must
you
become
too
attached
to
him
for
you
are
not
human
you
are
not
his
natural
mate
you
cannot
bear
his
young
you
cannot
completely
share
you
can
only
accept
so
if
love
should
come
to
you
take
it
and
enjoy
it
but
do
not
try
to
possess
it
for
there
lies
heartache
rather
than
happiness
and
it
is
a
world
of
heartache
my
little
one
to
long
for
something
which
you
cannot
have
to
long
for
something
which
one
cannot
have
copper
knew
that
feeling
it
had
been
with
her
ever
since
kennon
had
come
into
her
life
that
night
a
year
ago
and
it
had
grown
until
it
had
become
gigantic
he
was
kindyes
he
was
harshoccasionally
yet
he
had
shown
her
no
more
affection
than
he
would
have
shown
a
dog
lessfor
he
would
have
petted
a
dog
and
he
did
not
touch
her
he
laughed
but
she
was
not
a
part
of
his
laughter
he
needed
her
but
the
need
was
that
of
a
builder
for
a
tool
he
liked
her
and
sometimes
shared
his
problems
and
triumphs
with
her
and
sometimes
his
defeats
but
he
did
not
love
there
had
never
been
for
her
the
bright
fierce
look
he
had
bent
upon
the
woman
eloise
those
times
when
she
had
come
to
him
the
look
men
gave
to
those
who
found
favor
in
their
eyes
had
he
looked
at
her
but
once
with
that
expression
she
would
have
come
to
him
though
fire
barred
the
way
the
woman
eloise
was
a
fool
copper
looked
at
him
across
the
corner
of
the
desk
the
yellow
hair
the
bronze
skin
firm
chin
soft
lips
and
long
straight
nose
the
narrowed
eyes
hooded
beneath
thick
brows
scanning
the
papers
in
his
leantendoned
hands
his
nearness
was
an
ache
in
her
bodyyet
he
was
far
away
she
thought
of
how
his
hands
would
feel
upon
her
he
had
touched
her
once
and
that
touch
had
burned
like
hot
iron
for
hours
she
had
felt
it
he
looked
up
her
heart
choked
her
with
its
beating
she
would
die
for
him
if
he
would
but
once
run
his
fingers
over
her
tingling
skin
and
stroke
her
hair
the
naked
emotion
in
coppers
face
was
readable
enough
kennon
thought
one
didnt
need
sorovkin
techniques
to
interpret
what
was
in
her
mind
and
it
would
have
been
amusing
if
it
werent
so
sad
for
what
she
wanted
he
couldnt
give
yet
if
she
were
human
it
would
be
easy
a
hundred
generations
of
betan
moral
code
said
never
yet
when
he
looked
at
her
their
voices
faded
he
was
a
mana
member
of
the
ruling
race
she
was
an
animala
beasta
humanoidnear
human
but
not
near
enough
to
like
her
was
easybut
to
love
her
was
impossible
it
would
be
bestiality
yet
his
body
less
discerning
than
his
mind
responded
to
her
nearness
he
sighed
it
was
a
pleasant
unpleasantness
a
mixed
emotion
he
could
not
analyze
in
a
way
it
was
poetrythe
fierce
vaguely
disquieting
poetry
of
the
sensual
santosian
bardsthe
lyrics
that
sung
of
the
joys
of
flesh
he
had
never
really
liked
them
yet
they
filled
him
with
a
vague
longing
an
odd
uneasinessjust
the
sort
that
filled
him
now
there
was
a
deadly
parallel
here
he
sighed
yes
sir
do
you
want
something
copper
asked
i
could
use
a
cup
of
coffee
he
said
these
reports
are
getting
me
down
the
banality
amused
himsitting
here
thinking
of
copper
and
talking
about
coffee
banality
was
at
once
the
curse
and
the
saving
grace
of
mankind
it
kept
men
from
the
emotional
peaks
and
valleys
that
could
destroy
them
he
chuckled
shakily
the
only
alternative
would
be
to
get
rid
of
herand
he
couldnt
or
wouldntthe
question
intruded
slyly
do
that
copper
returned
with
a
steaming
cup
which
she
set
before
him
truly
this
coffee
was
a
mans
drink
she
had
tried
it
once
but
the
hot
bitterness
scalded
her
mouth
and
flooded
her
body
with
its
heat
and
she
had
felt
so
lightheaded
not
like
herself
at
all
it
wasnt
a
drink
for
lani
of
that
she
was
certain
yet
he
enjoyed
it
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
he
was
pleased
with
her
perhapsyetshe
might
find
favor
in
his
eyes
the
hope
was
always
there
within
hera
hope
that
was
at
once
fear
and
prayer
and
if
she
didshe
would
know
what
to
do
kennon
looked
up
coppers
face
was
convulsed
with
a
bright
mixture
of
hope
and
pain
never
he
swore
had
he
saw
anything
more
beautiful
or
sad
involuntarily
he
placed
his
hand
upon
her
arm
she
flinched
her
muscles
tensing
under
his
finger
tips
it
was
though
his
fingers
carried
a
galvanic
current
that
backlashed
up
his
arm
even
as
it
stiffened
hers
whats
the
matter
copper
he
asked
softly
nothing
doctor
im
just
upset
why
there
it
was
again
the
calm
friendly
curiosity
that
was
worse
than
a
bath
in
ice
water
her
heart
sank
she
shivered
she
would
never
find
her
desire
here
he
was
coldcoldcold
he
wouldnt
see
he
didnt
care
all
rightso
that
was
how
it
had
to
be
but
first
she
would
tell
him
then
he
could
do
with
her
as
he
wished
i
hopedfor
the
past
year
that
you
would
see
me
that
you
would
think
of
me
not
as
a
lani
but
as
a
beloved
the
words
came
faster
now
tumbling
over
one
another
that
you
would
desire
me
and
take
me
to
those
worlds
we
cannot
know
unless
you
humans
show
us
i
have
hoped
so
much
but
i
suppose
its
wrongfor
youyou
are
so
very
human
and
iwell
im
not
the
last
three
words
held
all
the
sadness
and
the
longing
of
mankind
aspiring
to
be
god
my
dearmy
poor
child
kennon
murmured
she
looked
at
him
but
her
eyes
could
not
focus
on
his
face
for
his
hands
were
on
her
shoulders
and
the
nearness
of
him
drove
the
breath
from
her
body
from
a
distance
she
heard
a
hard
tight
voice
that
was
her
own
oh
siroh
please
sir
the
hands
withdrew
leaving
emptinessbut
her
heartbeat
slowed
and
the
pink
haze
cleared
and
she
could
see
his
face
and
with
a
surge
of
terror
and
triumph
she
realized
what
she
saw
that
hard
bright
look
that
encompassed
and
possessed
her
the
curved
lips
drawn
over
white
white
teeth
the
flared
nostrils
the
hungry
demand
upon
his
face
that
answered
the
demand
in
her
heart
and
she
knewat
lastwith
a
knowledge
that
turned
her
limbs
to
water
that
she
had
found
favor
in
his
eyes
chapter
xi
mixed
emotion
ha
the
author
of
that
cliche
didnt
even
know
its
meaning
kennon
strode
furiously
down
the
dusty
road
toward
station
one
trying
to
sublimate
his
inner
conflict
into
action
it
was
useless
of
course
for
once
he
stopped
moving
the
grim
tugofwar
between
training
and
desire
would
begin
again
and
no
matter
how
it
ended
the
result
would
be
unsatisfactory
as
long
as
he
had
been
able
to
delude
himself
that
he
was
fond
of
copper
the
way
a
man
is
fond
of
some
lesser
species
it
had
been
all
right
but
he
knew
now
that
he
was
fond
of
her
as
a
man
is
of
a
womanand
it
was
hell
for
no
rationalization
in
the
universe
would
allow
him
to
define
her
as
human
copper
was
humanoidsomething
like
human
and
to
live
with
her
and
love
her
would
not
be
miscegenation
which
was
bad
enough
but
bestiality
which
was
a
thousand
times
worse
although
throughout
most
of
the
brotherhood
miscegenation
was
an
unknown
word
and
even
bestiality
had
become
a
loose
definition
on
many
worlds
with
humanoid
populations
the
words
had
definite
meaning
and
moral
force
to
a
betan
andgod
help
himhe
was
a
betan
a
lifetime
of
training
in
a
moral
code
that
frowned
upon
mixed
marriages
and
shrank
appalled
from
even
the
thought
of
mixing
species
was
nothing
to
bring
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
he
loved
copper
it
was
odd
kennon
reflected
bitterly
that
humans
could
do
with
animals
what
their
customs
and
codes
prohibited
them
from
doing
to
themselves
for
thousands
of
yearsback
to
the
very
dawn
of
history
when
men
had
bred
horses
and
asses
to
produce
mulesmen
had
been
mixing
species
to
produce
useful
hybrids
yet
a
betan
who
could
hybridize
plants
or
animals
with
complete
equanimity
shrank
with
horror
from
the
thought
of
applying
the
same
technique
to
himself
what
was
there
about
a
human
being
that
was
so
sacrosanct
he
shook
his
head
angrily
he
didnt
know
there
was
no
answer
but
the
ideathe
beliefwas
there
ingrained
into
his
attitudes
a
part
of
his
outlook
built
carefully
block
by
block
from
infancy
until
it
now
towered
into
a
mighty
wall
that
barred
him
from
doing
what
he
wished
to
do
it
would
be
an
easier
hurdle
if
he
had
been
born
anywhere
except
on
beta
in
the
rest
of
the
brotherhood
the
color
of
a
mans
skin
the
shape
of
his
face
the
quality
and
color
of
his
hair
and
eyes
made
no
difference
all
men
were
brothers
but
on
beta
where
a
variantg
sun
had
already
caused
genetic
divergence
the
brotherhood
of
man
was
a
term
that
was
merely
given
lip
service
betans
were
different
and
from
birth
they
were
taught
to
accept
the
difference
and
to
live
with
it
mixing
of
betan
stock
with
other
human
species
while
not
actually
forbidden
was
so
encircled
with
conditioning
that
it
was
a
rare
betan
indeed
who
would
risk
selfopprobrium
and
the
contempt
of
his
fellows
to
mate
with
an
outsider
and
as
for
humanoidskennon
shuddered
he
couldnt
break
the
attitudes
of
a
lifetime
yet
he
loved
copper
and
she
knew
he
did
and
that
was
an
even
greater
horror
he
had
fled
from
the
office
from
the
glad
light
in
her
eyes
as
a
burned
child
flees
fire
he
needed
time
to
think
time
to
plan
yet
his
body
and
his
surface
thoughts
wanted
no
plans
or
time
living
with
a
lani
wasnt
frowned
upon
on
flora
many
of
the
staff
did
nor
did
anyone
seem
to
think
less
of
them
for
doing
so
even
alexander
himself
had
halfconfessed
to
a
more
than
platonic
affection
for
a
lani
called
susy
yet
this
was
no
excuse
nor
would
it
silence
the
cold
still
voice
in
his
mind
that
kept
repeating
sodomitesodomitesodomite
with
a
passionless
inflection
that
was
even
more
terrible
than
anger
the
five
kilometers
to
station
one
disappeared
unnoticed
beneath
his
feet
as
he
walked
and
he
looked
up
in
surprise
to
see
the
white
walls
and
red
roofs
of
the
station
looming
before
him
good
lord
doc
whats
got
into
you
the
stationmaster
said
you
look
like
youd
seen
a
ghost
and
out
in
this
sun
without
a
helmet
come
inside
man
before
you
get
sunstroke
kennon
chuckled
without
humor
getting
sunstroke
is
the
least
of
my
worries
al
he
said
but
he
allowed
al
crothers
to
usher
him
inside
its
odd
that
you
showed
up
right
now
al
said
his
dark
face
showing
the
curiosity
that
filled
him
i
just
had
a
call
from
message
center
not
five
minutes
ago
telling
me
to
have
you
call
in
if
you
showed
up
kennon
sighed
on
this
island
you
cant
get
away
from
the
phone
he
said
wryly
ok
where
is
it
you
look
pretty
bushed
doc
maybe
youd
better
rest
awhile
and
maybe
its
an
emergency
kennon
interrupted
and
probably
it
is
because
the
staff
can
handle
routine
mattersso
maybe
youd
better
show
me
where
you
keep
the
phone
one
moment
please
the
message
center
operator
said
there
were
a
few
clicks
in
the
background
heres
your
party
she
continued
go
ahead
doctor
kennon
a
nervous
voice
crackled
from
the
receiver
yes

needed
out
on
otpen
one
who

whats
the
rush
douglasdouglas
alexander
the
lani

dying
its
an
emergency
cousin
alexll
skin
us
alive
if
we
let
these
lani
die
douglas
kennon
hadnt
thought
of
him
since
the
one
time
they
had
met
in
alexandria
that
was
a
year
ago
it
seemed
much
longer
since
the
bossman
had
exiled
his
cousin
to
that
bleak
rock
to
the
east
of
flora
there
had
been
no
word
of
him
and
nowhe
laughed
a
sharp
bark
of
humorless
annoyancedouglas
couldnt
have
timed
it
better
if
he
had
tried
all
right
kennon
said
ill
come
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble
theyre
sick
thats
obvious
kennon
snapped
otherwise
you
wouldnt
be
calling
cant
you
tell
me
any
more
than
that
theyre
vomiting
they
have
diarrhea
several
have
had
fits
thanks
kennon
said
ill
be
right
out
expect
me
in
an
hour
so
youre
leaving
al
asked
as
he
cradled
the
phone
thats
a
practitioners
life
kennon
said
full
of
interruptions
can
i
borrow
your
jeep
ill
drive
you
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
the
hospital
kennon
said
ill
have
to
pick
up
my
gear
its
an
emergency
all
right
youre
a
tough
one
al
said
admiringly
id
hate
to
walk
five
kilos
in
this
heat
without
a
hatand
then
go
out
on
a
call
kennon
shrugged
its
not
necessarily
toughness
i
believe
in
doing
one
job
at
a
timeand
my
contract
reads
veterinary
service
not
personal
problems
the
job
comes
first
and
theres
work
to
do
copper
wasnt
in
sight
when
kennon
came
back
to
the
hospitala
fact
for
which
he
was
grateful
he
packed
quickly
threw
his
bags
into
the
jeep
and
took
off
with
almost
guilty
haste
hed
contact
the
hospital
from
the
otpens
right
now
all
he
wanted
was
to
put
distance
between
himself
and
copper
absence
might
make
the
heart
grow
fonder
but
at
the
moment
propinquity
was
by
far
the
more
dangerous
thing
he
pointed
the
blunt
nose
of
the
jeep
toward
mount
olympus
set
the
autopilot
opened
the
throttle
and
relaxed
as
best
he
could
as
the
little
vehicle
sped
at
top
speed
for
the
outer
islands
a
vague
curiosity
filled
him
hed
never
been
on
the
otpens
he
wondered
what
they
were
like
otpen
one
was
a
rocky
treeclad
islet
crowned
with
the
stellate
mass
of
a
class
ii
fortalice
but
this
one
wasnt
like
alexandria
it
was
fully
manned
and
in
service
condition
airboat
a
voice
crackled
from
the
dashboard
speaker
of
the
jeep
identify
yourself
you
are
being
tracked
kennon
quickly
flipped
the
iff
switch
dr
kennon
from
flora
he
said
thank
you
sir
you
are
expected
and
are
clear
to
land
bring
your
vehicle
down
in
the
marked
area
a
section
of
the
roof
turned
a
garish
yellow
as
kennon
circled
the
building
he
brought
the
jeep
in
lightly
setting
it
carefully
in
the
center
of
the
area
leave
your
vehicle
the
speaker
chattered
if
you
are
armed
leave
your
weapon
behind
its
not
my
habit
to
carry
a
gun
kennon
snapped
sorry
sirregulations
the
speaker
said
this
is
sop
kennon
left
the
jeep
and
instantly
felt
the
probing
tingle
of
a
search
beam
he
looked
around
curiously
at
the
flat
roof
of
the
fortress
with
its
domed
turrets
and
ugly
snouts
of
the
main
battery
projectors
pointing
skyward
beside
him
the
long
metal
doors
of
a
missile
launcher
made
a
rectangular
trace
on
the
smooth
surface
of
the
roof
behind
him
the
central
tower
poked
its
gaunt
ferromorph
and
durilium
outline
into
the
darkening
sky
bearing
its
crown
of
spiderweb
radar
antennae
turning
steadily
on
their
gimbals
covering
a
vast
hemisphere
from
horizon
to
zenith
with
endless
inspection
from
the
base
of
the
tower
a
man
emerged
he
was
tall
taller
even
than
kennon
and
the
muscles
of
his
body
showed
through
the
tightness
of
his
battle
dress
his
face
was
harsh
and
in
his
hands
he
carried
a
burkholtz
magnumthe
most
powerful
portable
weapon
mankind
had
yet
devised
you
are
dr
kennon
the
trooper
asked
i
am
your
id
please
kennon
handed
it
over
and
the
big
man
scanned
the
card
with
practiced
eyes
check
he
said
follow
me
sir
my
bags
kennon
said
theyll
be
taken
care
of
kennon
shrugged
and
followed
the
man
into
the
tower
a
modern
gravshaft
lowered
them
to
the
ground
floor
they
passed
through
a
gloomy
caricature
of
the
great
hall
in
alexandria
through
an
iris
and
down
a
long
corridor
lined
with
doors
a
bell
rang
back
the
trooper
said
against
the
wall
quick
into
the
doorway
whats
up
another
practice
alert
the
troopers
voice
was
bored
it
gets
so
that
youd
almost
wish
for
a
fight
to
relieve
the
monotony
a
trooper
and
several
lani
came
down
the
corridor
running
in
disciplined
formation
steel
clanged
on
steel
as
they
turned
the
corner
and
moments
later
the
whine
of
servos
came
faintly
to
their
ears
from
somewhere
deep
in
the
pile
a
rising
crescendo
of
generators
under
full
battle
load
sent
out
vibrations
that
could
be
sensed
rather
than
heard
a
klaxon
squawked
briefly
there
was
another
clash
of
metal
and
a
harsh
voice
boomed
through
the
corridors
fourteen
seconds
well
done
secure
stations
the
trooper
grinned
that
ties
the
record
he
said
we
can
go
now
the
corridor
ended
abruptly
at
an
iris
flanked
by
two
sentries
they
conferred
briefly
with
kennons
guide
dilated
the
iris
and
motioned
for
kennon
to
enter
the
pastel
interior
of
the
modern
office
was
a
shocking
contrast
to
the
gray
ferromorph
corridors
outside
douglas
alexander
was
standing
behind
the
desk
he
was
much
the
same
his
pudgy
face
was
haggard
with
uncertainty
and
his
eyes
darted
back
and
forth
as
his
fingers
caressed
the
knobby
grip
of
a
small
burkholtz
jutting
from
a
holster
at
his
waist
there
were
new
unpleasant
furrows
between
his
eyes
he
looked
older
and
the
indefinable
air
of
cruelty
was
more
pronounced
he
had
been
frightened
the
last
time
kennon
had
seen
him
and
he
was
frightened
now
im
not
sure
whether
i
am
glad
to
see
you
kennon
he
said
uncertainly
but
i
suppose
i
have
to
be
kennon
believed
him
how
have
you
been
kennon
asked
not
too
bad
until
this
afternoon
things
have
been
going
pretty
well
he
shifted
uncomfortably
from
one
foot
to
another
i
suppose
cousin
alex
will
skin
me
for
this
but
theres
nothing
else
i
can
do
he
licked
his
lips
youve
been
here
long
enoughand
youll
have
to
know
eventually
he
fidgeted
and
finally
sat
down
behind
the
desk
we
have
trouble
half
the
lani
were
stricken
about
four
hours
ago
it
was
sudden
no
warning
at
all
and
if
they
die
his
voice
trailed
off
wellwhat
are
we
waiting
for
get
someone
to
bring
my
bags
down
here
and
well
look
them
over
do
you
have
tocant
you
prescribe
something
how
i
havent
examined
the
patients
i
can
tell
you
whats
wrong
kennon
smiled
i
hardly
think
thats
the
way
to
do
it
even
though
your
description
might
be
accurate
you
still
might
miss
something
of
critical
importance
douglas
sighed
i
thought
thats
what
youd
say
he
said
ohvery
wellyou
might
as
well
see
what
we
have
out
here
you
cant
possibly
believe
that
i
dont
already
know
kennon
said
you
have
male
lani
douglas
looked
at
him
his
face
blank
with
surprise
buthow
did
you
know
no
one
on
the
main
island
does
except
the
family
and
we
never
talk
about
it
did
eloise
tell
you
i
noticed
she
was
struck
with
you
the
day
you
came
and
the
lani
who
have
come
out
here
since
have
been
talking
about
you
two
did
she
do
it
kennon
shook
his
head
she
never
said
a
word
then
how
im
not
stupid
kennon
said
that
story
youve
spread
about
artificial
fertilization
has
more
holes
in
it
than
a
sieve
that
technique
has
been
investigated
a
thousand
times
and
it
has
never
worked
past
the
first
generation
if
you
had
been
using
it
the
lani
would
long
ago
have
been
extinct
haploids
dont
reproduce
and
the
only
way
the
diploid
number
of
chromosomes
can
be
kept
is
to
replace
those
lost
by
maturation
division
of
the
ovum
you
might
be
able
to
keep
the
diploid
number
by
using
immature
ova
but
the
fertilization
technique
would
be
far
more
complex
than
the
simple
uterine
injections
you
use
at
hillside
station
douglas
looked
at
him
blankly
besides
kennon
added
i
have
a
microscope
i
checked
your
socalled
fertilizing
solution
i
found
spermatozoa
and
spermatozoa
only
come
from
males
whats
more
the
males
have
to
be
the
same
species
as
the
females
or
fertilization
will
not
take
place
so
there
must
be
male
lani
nothing
else
fits
youve
been
using
artificial
insemination
on
the
mainisland
lani
and
from
the
way
this
place
is
guarded
its
obvious
that
here
is
your
stud
farm
douglas
shrugged
and
spread
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
resignation
i
suppose
he
said
thats
the
way
old
doc
found
out
too
we
never
told
him
but
he
knew
before
he
ever
came
out
here
the
only
thing
that
puzzles
me
kennon
went
on
is
how
you
managed
to
eliminate
the
ychromosome
carriers
within
the
sperm
eh
the
male
sexdeterminant
half
the
sperm
carry
it
but
so
far
as
i
know
theres
never
been
a
male
born
on
the
main
island
ohthat
its
something
thats
done
in
the
labs
here
probably
one
of
the
technicians
could
tell
you
its
called
electroelectro
freezing
or
something
like
that
electrodiaphoresis
douglas
nodded
that
sounds
like
it
i
dont
know
anything
about
it
one
of
grandfathers
men
did
the
basic
work
we
just
follow
instructions
he
shrugged
wellsince
you
know
the
secret
theres
no
sense
in
hiding
the
bodies
come
along
and
tell
me
whats
wrong
it
was
a
peculiar
feeling
to
walk
down
the
row
of
cubical
rooms
with
their
barred
doors
the
whole
area
reminded
him
of
a
historical
novel
of
the
prisons
of
early
human
history
where
men
confined
other
men
for
infractions
of
social
customs
the
grimness
of
the
place
was
appalling
the
male
laniimpressive
in
their
physical
developmentwere
in
miserable
condition
nauseated
greenfaced
retching
the
sickening
odors
of
vomit
and
diarrhea
hung
heavily
on
the
air
douglas
coughed
and
held
a
square
of
cloth
to
his
face
and
even
kennon
strongstomached
as
he
was
could
feel
his
viscera
twitch
in
sympathy
with
the
caged
sufferers
great
fleming
man
kennon
exploded
you
cant
keep
them
here
get
them
out
give
them
some
fresh
air
this
place
would
make
a
well
man
sick
douglas
looked
at
him
i
wouldnt
take
one
of
them
out
unless
i
had
him
shackled
and
there
was
an
armed
guard
to
help
me
those
males
are
the
most
vicious
cunning
and
dangerous
animals
on
kardon
they
exist
with
but
one
thought
in
mindto
kill
kennon
looked
curiously
through
a
barred
door
at
one
of
the
lani
he
lay
on
a
bare
cot
a
magnificently
muscled
figure
with
a
ragged
black
beard
hiding
his
face
there
were
dozens
of
scars
on
his
body
and
one
angry
purple
area
on
his
thick
right
forearm
where
flesh
had
been
torn
away
not
too
long
ago
beads
of
sweat
stood
out
on
his
forehead
and
soft
moaning
noises
came
from
his
tight
lips
as
he
pressed
his
abdomen
with
thickfingered
hands
he
doesnt
look
so
dangerous
kennon
said
watch
it
douglas
warned
dont
get
too
close
but
the
warning
was
too
late
kennon
touched
the
bars
and
as
he
did
the
lani
moved
with
fluid
speed
one
huge
hand
clutching
kennons
sleeve
and
pulling
him
against
the
bars
while
the
other
darted
for
his
throat
fingers
bit
into
kennons
neck
and
tightened
in
a
viselike
grip
kennon
reacted
automatically
his
arms
came
up
inside
the
lanis
and
crashed
down
elbows
out
tearing
the
lani
loose
he
jumped
back
rubbing
his
bruised
throat
that
fellows
not
sick
he
gasped
hes
crazy
the
lani
glared
at
him
through
the
bars
disappointment
written
on
his
scarred
and
bearded
face
i
warned
you
douglas
said
his
voice
held
an
undertone
of
malicious
laughter
he
must
be
sick
or
he
would
have
killed
you
george
is
clever
in
a
stupid
sort
of
way
kennon
looked
into
the
cubicle
the
lani
glared
back
and
growled
there
was
a
beastlike
note
in
his
voice
that
made
the
short
hairs
on
kennons
neck
prickle
that
fellow
needs
a
lesson
he
said
you
want
to
give
it
to
him
douglas
asked
not
particularly
hamanyou
afraid
the
lani
taunted
his
voice
was
thick
and
harsh
all
men
fear
me
all
lani
too
i
am
boss
come
close
again
man
and
i
kill
you
are
they
all
that
stupid
kennon
asked
he
sounds
like
a
homicidal
moron
hes
not
stupid
douglas
said
just
uneducated
why
is
he
so
murderous
thats
his
training
all
his
life
he
has
fought
from
childhood
his
life
has
been
based
on
his
ability
to
survive
in
an
environment
where
every
male
is
his
enemy
you
see
here
the
sublimation
of
individuality
he
cannot
cooperate
with
another
male
he
hates
them
and
they
in
turn
hate
him
george
here
is
a
perfect
example
of
absolute
freedom
from
restraint
douglas
smiled
unpleasantly
his
whole
history
is
one
of
complete
lack
of
control
as
an
infant
being
a
male
his
mother
thought
she
was
favored
by
the
gods
and
she
denied
him
nothing
in
fact
we
were
quite
insistent
that
she
gave
him
everything
he
wanted
by
the
time
he
was
able
to
walk
and
take
care
of
himself
he
was
completely
spoiled
selfish
and
authoritative
then
we
took
him
and
a
dozen
others
exactly
like
him
and
put
them
together
douglas
grinned
you
should
see
what
happens
when
a
dozen
spoiled
brats
are
forced
to
live
together
its
more
fun
the
little
beasts
hate
each
other
on
sight
and
we
stimulate
them
to
compete
for
toys
food
and
drink
never
quite
enough
to
go
around
you
can
imagine
what
happens
instead
of
sharing
each
little
selfish
individualist
fights
to
get
everything
he
can
grab
except
for
one
thing
we
dont
punish
them
no
matter
what
they
do
if
anyone
shows
signs
of
cooperating
he
is
disciplined
severely
the
first
time
the
next
time
he
is
culled
but
other
than
that
we
leave
them
alone
they
develop
their
personalities
and
their
musclesand
if
one
proves
to
be
too
much
for
his
fellows
we
transfer
him
to
a
more
advanced
class
where
the
competition
is
keener
and
he
learns
what
it
is
to
lose
at
puberty
we
add
sex
drive
to
the
basics
and
by
the
time
our
male
reaches
maturity
we
have
something
like
george
actually
george
is
more
mature
than
either
you
or
i
he
has
all
the
answers
he
needs
hes
strong
solitary
authoritative
and
selfish
he
has
no
curiosity
and
resents
encroachment
hes
a
complete
individualist
if
he
proves
out
he
should
make
an
excellent
sire
but
isnt
he
dangerous
to
handle
kennon
asked
yes
but
we
take
precautions
kennon
grimaced
with
distaste
look
at
it
objectively
douglas
said
were
trying
to
select
the
best
physical
type
we
can
in
the
hope
that
hell
pass
his
qualities
to
his
offspring
and
theres
no
better
practical
way
to
select
the
strongest
and
hardiest
than
by
natural
selection
we
control
their
environment
as
little
as
possible
and
let
nature
do
our
educating
until
theyre
old
enough
to
be
useful
naturally
there
are
some
things
which
we
cannot
provide
such
as
exposure
to
disease
to
the
elements
and
to
predators
the
one
isnt
selective
about
whom
it
infects
while
the
others
would
tend
to
produce
cooperation
as
a
matter
of
survival
isnt
there
a
great
deal
of
mortality
under
such
a
regimen
kennon
asked
not
as
much
as
you
might
expect
its
about
twenty
per
cent
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
compensation
from
a
management
viewpoint
we
get
essentially
the
same
physical
end
product
as
we
would
from
a
closely
managed
operation
plus
a
great
saving
in
labor
males
you
see
are
fairly
expendable
we
only
need
a
few
a
year
its
brutal
so
it
is
but
life
is
brutal
still
its
efficient
for
our
purposes
we
merely
take
advantage
of
natural
impulses
to
produce
a
better
product
grandfather
got
the
idea
out
of
an
old
booksomething
about
the
noble
savage
natural
selection
and
survival
of
the
fittest
he
thought
it
was
greatsaid
there
was
nothing
like
relentless
competition
to
bring
out
the
strongest
and
hardiest
types
and
hes
been
right
for
centuries
can
you
imagine
anything
much
better
than
georgefrom
a
physical
viewpoint
he
is
a
magnificent
animal
kennon
admitted
as
he
eyed
the
lani
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
train
some
obedience
into
him
douglas
shook
his
head
that
would
introduce
a
modifying
factor
something
bigger
and
more
powerful
than
the
male
himself
and
that
would
modify
the
results
we
can
control
them
well
enough
with
knockout
gas
and
shackles
and
those
things
oddly
enough
dont
destroy
their
pride
or
selfesteem
they
think
that
we
use
them
because
we
are
afraid
and
it
satisfies
their
egos
kennon
eyed
the
caged
lani
dubiously
this
is
going
to
be
difficult
i
must
examine
them
and
treat
them
but
if
theyre
all
as
homicidal
as
this
one
you
fight
me
man
george
interrupted
his
face
twisted
into
lines
of
transparent
guile
i
am
boss
and
others
do
as
i
say
you
beat
me
then
you
are
boss
is
this
true
kennon
asked
oh
its
true
enough
douglas
said
george
is
the
leader
and
if
you
beat
him
youd
be
top
male
until
some
other
one
got
courage
enough
to
challenge
you
but
hes
just
trying
to
get
his
hands
on
you
hed
like
to
kill
kennon
looked
at
the
big
humanoid
appraisingly
george
was
huge
at
least
five
centimeters
taller
and
fifteen
kilograms
heavier
than
himself
and
he
was
all
muscle
i
dont
think
id
care
to
accept
that
challenge
unless
i
was
forced
to
kennon
said
douglas
chuckled
i
dont
blame
you
kennon
sighed
it
looks
like
we
are
going
to
need
reinforcements
to
get
these
brutes
under
control
im
not
going
in
there
with
them
and
i
cant
examine
them
from
out
here
oh
we
can
hold
them
all
right
paralysis
gas
and
shackles
will
keep
them
quiet
theres
no
need
to
bother
the
troopers
we
can
handle
this
by
ourselves
kennon
shrugged
its
your
baby
you
should
know
what
youre
doing
i
do
douglas
said
confidently
wait
here
until
i
get
the
gas
capsules
and
the
equipment
he
turned
and
walked
back
to
the
entrance
to
the
cell
block
at
the
iris
he
turned
be
careful
he
said
dont
worry
i
will
kennon
looked
at
george
through
the
bars
and
the
humanoid
glared
back
his
eyes
bright
with
hatred
kennon
felt
the
short
hairs
prickle
along
the
back
of
his
neck
george
roused
a
primal
emotionan
elemental
dislike
that
was
deeper
than
reasonan
antagonism
intensely
physical
almost
overpoweringa
purely
adrenal
response
that
had
no
business
in
the
makeup
of
a
civilized
human
he
had
thought
the
lani
had
a
number
of
human
traits
until
he
had
encountered
george
but
if
george
was
a
typical
malethen
the
lani
were
alien
he
flexed
his
muscles
and
stared
coldly
into
the
burning
blue
eyes
behind
the
bars
there
would
be
considerable
satisfaction
in
beating
this
monstrosity
to
a
quivering
pulp
millennia
of
human
preeminenceof
belief
that
nothing
no
matter
how
big
or
muscular
should
fail
to
recognize
that
a
mans
person
was
inviolatefed
the
fuel
of
his
anger
the
most
ferocious
beasts
on
ten
thousand
worlds
had
learned
this
lesson
and
yet
this
animal
had
laid
hands
on
him
with
intent
to
kill
a
cold
corner
of
his
mind
kept
telling
him
that
he
wasnt
behaving
rationally
but
he
disregarded
it
george
was
a
walking
need
for
a
lesson
in
manners
dont
get
the
idea
that
im
afraid
of
youyou
overmuscled
oaf
kennon
snapped
i
can
handle
you
or
anyone
like
you
and
if
you
put
your
hands
on
me
again
ill
beat
you
within
an
inch
of
your
worthless
life
the
lani
snarled
let
me
out
and
i
kill
you
but
you
are
like
all
men
you
use
gun
and
ironnot
fair
fight
douglas
returned
with
a
gas
capsule
and
a
set
of
shackles
all
right
he
said
were
ready
for
him
he
handed
kennon
the
shackles
and
a
key
to
the
cell
doorand
drew
his
burkholtz
see
the
lani
growled
it
is
as
i
say
men
are
cowards
you
know
gun
douglas
asked
as
he
pointed
the
muzzle
of
the
burkholtz
at
the
lani
i
know
george
growled
gun
kill
it
does
indeed
douglas
said
now
get
backclear
back
against
the
wall
george
snarled
but
didnt
move
ill
count
three
douglas
said
and
if
youre
not
back
by
then
ill
burn
you
down
youll
obey
even
if
you
wont
do
anything
elseonetwo
george
retreated
to
the
far
end
of
his
cell
now
face
the
wall
douglas
tossed
the
gas
capsule
into
the
cell
the
thinwalled
container
broke
releasing
a
cloud
of
vapor
george
crumpled
to
the
floor
now
we
wait
a
couple
of
minutes
for
the
gas
to
dissipate
douglas
said
after
that
hes
all
yours
you
can
go
in
and
put
the
irons
on
him
will
he
be
out
long
kennon
asked
about
five
minutes
after
that
hell
have
muscular
control
douglas
chuckled
theyre
stupid
he
said
they
know
what
gas
does
to
them
but
they
never
have
sense
enough
to
hold
their
breath
they
could
be
twice
as
much
trouble
as
they
are
all
right
its
safe
to
go
in
now
douglas
let
the
gun
dangle
in
his
hand
kennon
unlocked
the
door
and
george
rolled
over
muscles
bunched
and
driving
he
hit
the
door
with
such
force
that
kennon
was
slammed
against
the
wall
dazedhalf
stunned
by
the
speed
of
the
attack
georgehe
had
time
to
think
in
one
brief
flashwasnt
stupid
he
had
held
his
breath
for
the
necessary
two
minutes
douglas
jerked
the
blaster
up
and
fired
but
his
target
was
too
quick
george
dropped
and
rolled
the
sizzling
streak
of
violet
flashed
inches
above
his
body
and
tore
a
sixinch
hole
through
the
back
of
the
cell
and
then
george
was
on
him
the
huge
marvelously
fast
hands
of
the
humanoid
wrenched
the
blaster
out
of
douglass
hands
and
jerked
him
forward
a
scream
burst
from
douglas
as
georges
hands
closed
around
his
neck
muscles
sprang
into
writhing
life
in
the
humanoids
huge
forearms
there
was
a
soft
brittle
crack
and
douglas
sagged
limp
in
the
iron
grip
that
held
him
dangling
faugh
george
grunted
he
dropped
douglas
as
kennon
pushed
the
door
back
and
came
out
into
the
passageway
maybe
you
make
better
fight
george
said
as
he
lowered
his
head
into
the
muscular
mass
of
his
broad
shoulders
kennon
eyed
him
appraisingly
swinging
the
irons
in
his
right
hand
this
time
the
lani
didnt
charge
he
moved
slowly
half
crouched
long
arms
held
slightly
forward
kennon
backed
away
watching
the
humanoids
eyes
for
that
telltale
flicker
of
the
pupils
that
gives
warning
of
attack
the
expression
on
georges
face
never
changed
it
was
satisfiedsmug
almostreflecting
the
feelings
of
a
brute
conditioned
to
kill
and
given
an
opportunity
to
do
so
the
lani
radiated
confidence
kennon
shivered
involuntarily
he
wasnt
frightened
but
he
had
never
met
an
opponent
like
this
a
chill
raced
up
the
back
of
his
legs
and
spread
over
his
stomach
and
chest
his
mouth
was
dry
and
his
muscles
quivered
with
tense
anticipation
but
his
concentration
never
wavered
his
hard
blue
eyes
never
left
georges
searching
with
microscopic
intentness
for
the
faintest
sign
of
the
lanis
intentions
george
chargedhands
reaching
for
kennons
throat
face
twisted
in
a
snarl
of
rage
and
hate
but
even
as
he
charged
kennon
moved
he
ducked
beneath
the
lanis
outstretched
hands
and
drove
his
left
fist
deep
into
georges
belly
just
below
the
breastbone
air
whistled
out
of
the
lanis
gaping
mouth
as
he
bent
double
from
the
power
of
the
blow
kennon
clipped
him
on
the
chin
with
a
driving
knee
snapping
georges
head
back
and
smashed
the
bearded
face
with
the
shackles
blood
spurted
and
george
screamed
with
rage
one
of
the
lanis
big
hands
wrapped
around
the
shackles
and
tugged
kennon
let
go
and
drove
another
left
to
georges
ribs
the
lani
threw
the
irons
at
kennon
but
his
aim
was
poor
one
of
the
handcuff
rings
scraped
across
kennons
cheek
but
did
nothing
more
than
break
the
skin
half
paralyzed
by
the
blows
to
his
solar
plexus
georges
coordination
was
badly
impaired
but
he
kept
trying
kennon
wrapped
lean
fingers
about
one
of
georges
outstretched
hands
bent
pivoted
and
slammed
the
lani
with
bonecrushing
force
against
the
bars
of
a
nearby
cell
but
george
didnt
go
down
hes
more
brute
than
man
kennon
thought
no
man
could
take
a
beating
like
that
he
moved
aside
from
georges
stumbling
rush
feeling
a
twinge
of
pity
for
the
battered
humanoid
it
was
no
contest
strong
as
he
was
george
didnt
know
the
rudiments
of
handtohand
fighting
his
reactions
were
those
of
an
animal
to
close
clutch
bite
and
tear
even
if
he
were
completely
well
the
results
would
have
been
the
same
it
would
merely
have
taken
longer
kennon
drove
a
vicious
judo
chop
to
the
junction
of
the
lanis
neck
and
shoulder
brute
strength
was
no
match
for
the
highly
evolved
mayhem
that
every
spaceman
learns
as
a
necessary
part
of
his
trade
george
had
never
been
on
planet
leave
in
a
spaceport
town
he
knew
nothing
about
the
dives
the
crimps
the
hostile
port
police
his
idea
of
fighting
was
that
of
a
beast
but
kennon
was
a
civilized
man
to
whom
fighting
was
an
art
perfected
by
millennia
of
warfare
and
kennon
knew
his
trade
even
so
it
took
longer
than
kennon
expected
because
george
was
big
george
was
strong
and
george
had
courage
and
pride
that
kept
him
coming
as
long
as
the
blazing
will
behind
his
blazing
eyes
could
drive
his
battered
body
but
the
end
was
inevitable
kennon
looked
at
his
bloody
arm
where
georges
teeth
had
reached
their
mark
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
scratch
but
it
had
been
close
george
had
his
lesson
and
kennon
felt
oddly
degraded
he
sighed
dragged
george
back
into
the
cell
and
locked
the
door
then
he
turned
to
douglas
the
howls
of
hate
from
the
caged
lani
died
to
a
sullen
silence
as
kennon
gently
examined
the
limp
body
douglas
wasnt
dead
his
neck
was
dislocated
not
broken
but
he
was
in
serious
condition
kennon
was
still
bending
over
douglas
wondering
how
to
call
for
help
when
three
guards
burst
through
the
door
faces
grim
weapons
at
the
ready
whats
going
on
here
the
leader
demanded
the
board
showed
an
open
door
down
here
he
saw
the
bodymr
douglas
he
gasped
the
commandant
will
have
to
know
about
this
he
took
a
communicator
from
his
waist
belt
and
spoke
rapidly
into
it
arleson
in
stud
cell
block
he
said
attempted
escape
one
casualtydouglas
alexanderyes
thats
right
nohes
not
dead
send
a
litter
and
bearers
inform
the
commandant
i
am
making
investigation
on
the
spot
out
he
turned
to
look
coldly
at
kennon
who
are
youand
what
happened
here
he
asked
kennon
told
him
you
mean
you
took
george
arleson
said
look
in
his
cell
if
you
dont
believe
me
the
soldier
looked
and
then
turned
hack
to
kennon
there
was
awed
respect
in
his
hard
brown
eyes
you
did
thatto
him
man
youre
a
fighter
he
said
in
an
unbelieving
voice
a
stretcher
detail
manned
by
two
soberfaced
lani
females
came
in
loaded
douglass
body
on
the
stretcher
and
silently
bore
it
away
douglas
was
a
fool
arleson
said
he
knew
we
never
handle
this
kind
without
maximum
restraint
i
wonder
why
he
did
it
i
couldnt
say
he
told
me
that
gas
and
shackles
would
hold
him
he
knew
better
these
lani
know
gas
capsules
all
george
bad
to
do
was
hold
his
breath
in
that
cell
george
would
have
killed
you
you
couldnt
have
stayed
away
from
him
kennon
shrugged
maybe
that
was
what
douglas
had
wanted
kennon
sighed
he
didnt
have
the
answer
and
it
could
just
be
that
douglas
had
tried
to
show
off
well
he
would
pay
for
it
hed
have
a
stiff
neck
for
months
and
perhaps
that
was
a
proper
way
to
end
it
commander
mullins
a
thin
grayfaced
man
with
the
hard
cold
eyes
of
a
professional
soldier
came
into
the
corridor
followed
by
another
trooper
his
eyes
took
in
the
wreckage
that
had
been
george
the
split
lips
the
smashed
nose
the
puffed
eyes
the
cuts
and
bruises
and
then
raked
across
kennon
spacemanhey
he
asked
ive
seen
work
like
that
before
kennon
nodded
i
was
once
im
station
veterinarian
now
douglas
called
me
oversaid
it
was
an
emergency
mullins
nodded
wellwhy
arent
you
tending
to
it
i
have
to
examine
them
kennon
said
gesturing
at
the
cells
and
i
dont
want
any
more
trouble
like
this
dont
worry
you
wont
have
it
now
that
youve
beaten
george
youll
have
no
trouble
at
all
youre
top
dog
mullins
gestured
at
the
cages
theyll
be
good
for
a
while
now
youd
better
get
on
with
your
work
theres
been
enough
disruption
of
routine
for
today
the
men
will
help
you
kennon
checked
in
at
the
commandants
office
before
he
left
for
the
main
island
how
is
douglas
he
asked
hes
alive
mullins
said
we
flew
him
to
albertsvilleand
good
riddance
how
are
the
lani
theyll
be
all
right
kennon
said
its
just
food
poisoning
i
suggest
you
check
your
kitchen
and
your
food
handlers
theres
a
break
in
sanitation
that
could
incapacitate
your
whole
command
i
found
a
few
things
wrong
but
there
are
probably
more
ill
check
on
itand
thanks
for
the
advice
mullins
said
sit
down
doctor
your
airboat
wont
be
serviced
for
another
few
minutes
tell
me
how
things
are
on
the
main
island
hows
blalok
you
know
him
of
course
i
used
to
be
a
frequent
visitor
there
but
with
that
young
pup
here
i
couldnt
leave
i
didnt
dare
to
hed
have
disrupted
routine
in
a
single
day
look
what
he
did
in
half
an
hour
frankly
i
owe
you
a
debt
for
getting
him
off
my
hands
mullins
chuckled
dryly
thats
a
fine
thing
to
say
kennon
grinned
but
i
can
sympathize
it
took
us
two
months
to
straighten
out
alexandria
after
the
bossman
sent
him
here
i
heard
about
that
wellwere
under
control
now
things
are
going
pretty
smoothly
theyll
be
better
here
mullins
said
now
that
douglas
is
gone
he
shrugged
i
hope
the
boss
doesnt
send
him
back
hes
hard
to
handle
and
he
makes
discipline
a
problem
could
you
tell
meor
would
it
be
violating
security
kennon
said
why
do
you
have
a
class
ii
installation
on
full
war
footing
out
here
mullins
chuckled
its
no
secret
he
said
there
was
a
commercial
raid
on
this
place
about
fifty
years
ago
seems
as
though
one
of
our
competitors
didnt
like
us
alexandria
was
on
a
war
footing
then
and
managed
to
hold
them
off
but
it
scared
the
old
man
you
see
our
competitive
position
is
based
on
lani
labor
our
competitors
didnt
know
that
their
intelligence
wasnt
so
good
up
until
that
time
wed
been
keeping
the
males
out
here
in
what
was
hardly
more
than
a
stockade
those
people
could
have
taken
a
few
dozen
females
and
a
couple
of
males
and
theyd
have
been
in
business
but
they
didnt
know
they
tried
to
smash
alexandria
instead
naturally
they
didnt
have
a
chance
and
after
it
was
over
the
old
man
got
smart
he
still
had
the
tapes
for
alexandria
so
he
built
a
duplicate
out
here
and
spent
a
few
millions
on
modern
armament
the
way
were
set
now
itd
take
a
battle
group
to
hurt
us
but
how
about
security
dont
the
others
know
about
the
lani
now
its
a
moot
question
but
it
wont
do
them
any
good
they
cant
crack
this
place
and
without
males
all
the
females
on
flora
wouldnt
do
them
enough
longterm
good
to
pay
for
the
force
theyd
need
to
be
successful
so
thats
why
the
males
are
isolated
theres
another
reasontwo
of
them
in
fact
one
is
physical
even
the
best
male
is
a
dangerous
beast
they
have
a
flair
for
violence
that
makes
them
useless
as
labor
and
their
training
doesnt
help
matters
and
the
other
is
mental
the
females
on
the
main
island
believe
that
we
humans
are
responsible
for
the
continuation
of
their
breed
this
tends
to
keep
them
in
line
we
have
a
great
deal
more
trouble
with
them
out
here
once
they
know
the
truth
weve
had
a
number
of
cases
of
females
trying
to
engineer
a
males
escape
but
theyre
never
repeated
mullins
said
grimly
actually
it
would
be
an
interesting
life
out
here
except
for
the
abattoir
he
grimaced
thats
an
unpleasant
chore
you
mean
kennon
said
why
certainly
what
else
could
we
do
with
senile
animals
but
thats
murder
mullins
shook
his
head
no
more
than
killing
a
cow
for
beef
you
know
kennon
said
ive
never
thought
of
what
happened
to
aged
lani
sure
ive
never
seen
one
butlord
listerim
a
fool
youll
get
used
to
the
idea
mullins
said
they
arent
human
and
except
for
a
few
they
arent
as
intelligent
as
a
santosian
varl
i
know
that
they
look
like
us
except
for
those
tails
but
thats
as
far
as
it
goes
ive
spent
two
hundred
years
with
them
and
i
know
what
im
talking
about
thats
what
alexander
says
he
should
know
hes
lived
with
them
all
his
life
wellperhaps
but
im
not
convinced
neither
was
old
docnot
until
the
day
he
died
did
he
change
then
i
dont
know
i
wasnt
there
but
old
doc
was
a
stubborn
cuss
kennon
stood
up
ive
given
instructions
for
treatment
to
your
corpsman
he
said
now
i
think
id
better
be
getting
back
i
have
some
reports
to
finish
mullins
smiled
grimly
you
know
he
said
i
get
the
feeling
that
you
dont
approve
of
this
operation
frankly
i
dont
kennon
said
but
i
signed
a
contract
he
turned
toward
the
door
and
gestured
to
the
two
lani
who
waited
outside
with
his
bags
i
can
find
my
way
to
the
roof
he
said
wellgood
luck
mullins
said
well
call
you
again
if
we
need
you
do
that
kennon
replied
he
wanted
to
leave
to
get
away
from
this
place
and
back
to
the
main
island
he
wanted
to
see
copper
hed
be
damned
if
anyone
was
going
to
butcher
her
if
he
had
to
stay
here
until
she
died
of
old
age
hed
do
it
but
nobody
was
going
to
hurt
her
chapter
xii
kennon
wondered
if
his
colleagues
in
human
medicine
felt
toward
their
patients
as
he
did
toward
the
lani
or
if
they
ultimately
lost
their
individuality
and
became
mere
hosts
for
diseases
parasites
and
tumorsvehicles
for
the
practice
of
surgical
and
medical
skillseconomic
units
whose
wellbeing
meant
a
certain
amount
of
credits
probably
not
he
decided
they
were
human
and
their
very
humanity
made
them
persons
rather
than
things
but
the
possession
of
individuality
was
not
an
asset
in
the
practice
of
animal
medicine
where
economics
was
the
main
factor
and
the
satisfaction
of
the
owner
the
principal
personality
problem
the
normal
farm
animals
the
shrakes
cattle
sheep
morks
and
swine
were
no
problem
they
were
merely
a
job
but
the
lani
were
different
they
werent
human
but
they
were
intelligent
and
they
did
have
personality
even
though
they
didnt
possess
that
indefinable
quality
that
separated
man
from
the
beasts
it
was
hard
to
treat
them
with
dispassionate
objectivity
in
fact
it
was
impossible
and
this
lack
of
objectivity
annoyed
him
should
he
be
this
way
was
he
right
to
identify
them
as
individuals
and
treat
them
as
persons
rather
than
things
the
passing
months
had
failed
to
rob
them
of
their
personalities
they
had
not
become
the
faceless
mass
of
a
herd
of
cattle
or
a
flock
of
sheep
they
were
still
not
essentially
different
from
humansand
wouldnt
men
themselves
lose
many
of
their
human
characteristics
if
they
were
herded
into
barracks
and
treated
as
property
for
forty
generations
wouldnt
men
too
approach
the
animal
condition
if
they
were
bred
and
treated
as
beasts
their
pedigrees
recorded
their
types
winnowed
and
selected
the
thought
was
annoying
it
would
be
better
kennon
reflected
if
he
didnt
have
time
to
think
if
he
were
so
busy
he
could
drop
to
his
bed
exhausted
each
night
and
sleep
without
dreaming
if
he
could
keep
on
the
run
so
fast
that
he
wouldnt
have
time
to
sit
and
reflect
but
he
had
done
his
work
too
well
he
had
trained
his
staff
too
thoroughly
they
could
handle
the
petty
routines
of
minor
treatment
and
laboratory
tests
as
well
as
he
he
had
only
the
intellectual
stimulation
of
atypical
cases
and
these
were
all
too
rare
the
routine
inspections
were
boring
yet
he
forced
himself
to
make
them
because
the
filled
the
time
the
hospital
wards
were
virtually
empty
of
patients
the
work
was
up
to
date
the
whole
island
was
enjoying
a
carnival
of
health
and
kennon
was
still
impaled
upon
the
horns
of
his
dilemma
it
wasnt
so
bad
now
that
the
first
shock
was
over
but
it
was
bad
enoughand
showed
no
signs
of
getting
better
now
that
copper
realized
he
wanted
her
she
did
nothing
to
make
his
life
easier
instead
she
did
her
best
to
get
underfoot
usually
in
some
provocative
position
it
was
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
a
marble
statue
kennon
reflected
grimly
but
it
did
have
its
humorous
side
and
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
copper
wasnt
human
could
have
been
thoroughly
enjoyable
that
however
was
the
real
hell
of
it
he
couldnt
relax
and
enjoy
the
contesthis
feet
were
on
too
slippery
ground
and
copper
with
her
unerring
female
instinct
knew
just
what
to
do
to
make
the
footing
slipperier
sooner
or
later
she
was
certain
that
he
would
fall
it
was
only
a
question
of
applying
sufficient
pressure
at
the
right
spot
and
the
right
time
now
that
she
knew
he
desired
her
she
was
content
to
wait
the
only
thing
that
had
bothered
her
was
the
uncertainty
whether
he
cared
or
not
for
copper
the
future
was
a
simple
thing
and
she
was
lighthearted
about
it
but
not
so
kennon
even
after
the
initial
shock
had
passed
there
still
remained
the
moral
customs
the
conditioning
and
the
prohibitions
but
copperwas
copperand
somehow
the
conditioning
lost
its
force
in
her
presence
perhaps
he
thought
wryly
it
was
a
symptom
of
the
gradual
erosion
of
his
moral
character
in
this
abnormal
environment
im
getting
stale
he
confided
to
copper
as
he
sat
in
his
office
idly
turning
the
pages
of
the
kardon
journal
of
allied
medical
sciences
theres
nothing
to
do
thats
interesting
you
could
help
me
copper
said
as
she
looked
up
from
the
pile
of
cards
she
was
sorting
he
had
given
her
the
thankless
task
of
reorganizing
the
files
and
she
was
barely
half
through
the
project
theres
nothing
to
do
thats
interesting
he
repeated
he
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
from
this
angle
copper
looked
decidedly
intriguing
as
she
bent
over
the
file
drawer
and
replaced
a
stack
of
cards
i
could
suggest
something
copper
said
demurely
yes
i
know
he
said
youre
full
of
suggestions
i
was
thinking
that
we
could
go
on
a
picnic
a
what
a
picnic
take
a
lunch
and
go
somewhere
in
the
jeep
maybe
up
into
the
hills
i
think
it
might
be
fun
why
not
kennon
agreed
at
least
it
would
break
the
monotony
tell
you
what
you
run
up
to
the
house
and
tell
kara
to
pack
a
lunch
and
well
take
the
day
off
good
i
hoped
youd
say
that
im
getting
tired
of
these
dirty
old
cards
she
stood
up
and
sidled
past
the
desk
kennon
resisted
the
impulse
to
slap
as
she
went
past
and
congratulated
himself
on
his
selfcontrol
as
she
looked
at
him
with
a
halfdisappointed
expression
on
her
face
she
had
expected
it
he
thought
gleefully
score
one
for
morality
he
smiled
whatever
the
other
lani
might
be
copper
was
different
quick
volatile
intelligent
she
was
a
constant
delight
a
flashing
kaleidoscope
of
unexpected
facets
perhaps
the
others
were
the
same
if
he
knew
them
better
but
he
didnt
know
themand
avoided
learning
in
that
direction
lay
ulcers
well
go
to
olympus
he
said
copper
looked
dubious
id
rather
not
go
there
thats
forbidden
ground
oh
nonsense
youre
merely
superstitious
she
smiled
perhaps
youre
right
you
usually
are
thats
the
virtue
of
being
a
man
even
if
im
wrong
im
right
he
chuckled
at
the
peculiar
expression
on
her
face
now
off
with
youand
get
that
lunch
basket
packed
she
bowed
yes
master
your
slave
flies
on
winged
feet
to
execute
your
commands
kennon
chuckled
copper
had
been
reading
old
docs
romances
again
he
recognized
the
florid
style
kennon
landed
the
jeep
in
a
mountain
meadow
halfway
up
the
slope
of
the
peacefully
slumbering
volcano
it
was
quiet
and
cool
and
the
light
breeze
was
blowing
olympuss
smoky
cap
away
from
them
to
the
west
copper
unpacked
the
lunch
she
moved
slowly
after
all
there
was
plenty
of
time
and
she
wasnt
very
hungry
neither
was
kennon
lets
go
for
a
walk
copper
said
the
woods
look
cooland
maybe
we
can
work
up
an
appetite
good
idea
i
could
use
some
exercise
that
lunch
looks
big
enough
to
choke
a
horse
and
id
like
to
do
it
justice
they
walked
through
the
woods
skirting
scant
patches
of
underbrush
slowly
moving
higher
on
the
mountain
slopes
the
trees
unlike
those
of
beta
did
not
end
abruptly
at
a
snow
line
but
pushed
green
fingers
upward
through
passages
between
old
lava
flows
on
whose
black
wrinkled
surfaces
nothing
grew
the
faint
hum
of
insects
and
the
piping
calls
of
the
birdlike
mammals
added
to
the
impression
of
remoteness
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
scarcely
twenty
kilometers
from
this
primitive
microcosm
was
the
border
of
the
highly
organized
and
productive
farmlands
of
outworld
enterprises
do
you
think
we
can
see
the
hospital
if
we
go
high
enough
copper
said
she
panted
a
little
unaccustomed
to
the
altitude
possibly
kennon
said
it
is
a
long
distance
away
but
we
should
be
able
to
see
alexandria
he
added
thats
high
enough
and
big
enough
he
looked
at
her
curiously
how
is
it
that
youre
so
breathless
he
asked
were
not
that
high
youre
getting
fat
with
too
much
soft
living
copper
smiled
perhaps
im
getting
old
nonsense
kennon
chuckled
its
just
fat
come
to
think
of
it
you
are
plumper
not
that
i
mind
but
if
youre
going
to
keep
that
sylphlike
figure
youd
better
go
on
a
diet
youre
too
good
to
me
copper
said
youre
darn
right
i
am
welllets
get
going
exercise
is
always
good
for
the
waistline
and
id
like
to
see
whats
up
ahead
scarcely
a
kilometer
ahead
they
came
to
a
wall
of
lava
that
barred
their
path
oh
oh
kennon
said
we
cant
go
over
that
he
looked
at
the
wrinkled
and
shattered
rock
with
its
knifelike
edges
i
dont
think
my
feet
could
take
it
copper
admitted
it
looks
like
the
end
of
the
trail
nonot
quite
kennon
said
there
seems
to
be
a
path
here
he
pointed
to
a
narrow
cleft
in
the
black
rock
lets
see
where
it
goes
copper
hung
back
i
dont
think
i
want
to
she
said
doubtfully
it
looks
awfully
dark
and
narrow
oh
stop
it
nothings
going
to
hurt
us
come
on
kennon
took
her
hand
unwillingly
copper
allowed
herself
to
be
led
forward
theres
something
about
this
place
that
frightens
me
she
said
uncomfortably
as
the
high
black
wails
closed
in
narrowing
until
only
a
slit
of
yellow
sky
was
visible
overhead
the
path
underfoot
was
surprisingly
smooth
and
free
from
rocks
but
the
narrow
corridor
steeped
in
shadows
was
gloomy
and
depressingly
silent
it
even
bothered
kennon
although
he
wouldnt
admit
it
what
forces
had
sliced
this
razorthin
cleft
in
the
dense
rock
around
them
earthquake
probably
and
if
it
happened
once
it
could
happen
again
he
would
hate
to
be
trapped
here
entombed
in
shattered
rock
gradually
the
passage
widened
then
abruptly
it
ended
a
bleak
vista
of
volcanic
ash
dotted
with
sputter
cones
opened
before
them
it
was
a
flat
tableland
roughly
circular
scarcely
half
a
kilometer
across
a
desolation
of
black
rock
stunted
trees
and
underbrush
and
gray
volcanic
ash
a
crater
somewhat
larger
than
the
rest
lay
with
its
nearest
edge
about
two
hundred
meters
away
the
rock
edges
were
fire
polished
gleaming
in
the
yellow
sunshine
and
the
thin
margin
of
trees
and
brush
surrounding
the
depression
were
gnarled
and
shrunken
twisted
into
fantastic
shapes
hey
whats
this
kennon
asked
curiously
that
crater
looks
peculiar
like
a
meteor
had
struck
herebut
those
stunted
plantshmmthere
must
have
been
some
radioactivity
too
he
looked
at
the
crater
speculatively
now
i
wonder
he
began
copper
had
turned
a
sickly
white
no
she
said
in
a
halfstrangled
voiceoh
no
kennon
looked
at
her
you
know
what
this
is
he
demanded
no
copper
said
but
her
voice
was
unsteady
youre
lying
but
i
dont
know
copper
wailed
im
only
guessing
ive
never
seen
this
place
before
in
my
life
pleaselets
get
out
of
here
then
you
know
about
this
kennon
demanded
i
think
its
the
pit
copper
said
the
redes
dont
say
where
it
is
but
the
description
fitsthe
circle
of
death
the
twisted
landits
all
like
the
redes
say
redeswhat
are
redes
and
what
is
this
business
about
circles
of
death
theres
something
here
thats
peculiar
and
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
its
nothing
truly
just
lets
go
back
lets
leave
this
place
its
no
good
its
tabu
tabu
youve
never
used
that
word
before
forbidden
who
forbids
it
the
godsthe
old
ones
it
is
not
for
lani
nor
for
you
her
voice
was
harsh
come
away
before
it
is
too
late
before
the
silent
death
strikes
you
down
im
going
to
have
a
look
at
this
youll
be
killed
copper
said
and
if
you
die
i
die
too
dont
be
foolish
theres
nothing
here
that
can
hurt
me
see
those
trees
and
plants
growing
right
up
to
the
craters
edge
if
they
can
take
it
permanently
i
can
stand
it
for
a
few
moments
if
theres
any
radioactivity
there
its
not
very
much
but
the
redes
say
oh
forget
those
redes
i
know
what
im
doing
besides
im
a
betan
and
can
stand
more
radiation
than
most
men
a
brief
exposure
isnt
going
to
hurt
me
you
go
and
i
go
too
copper
said
desperately
youll
stay
here
where
its
safe
kennon
said
flatly
im
going
with
you
copper
repeated
i
dont
want
to
live
without
you
i
tell
you
i
wont
be
hurt
and
one
quick
look
isnt
going
to
bother
whatevers
down
there
thats
what
roga
the
foolish
said
when
he
opened
lyssas
tower
but
he
brought
men
to
flora
and
your
little
look
may
bring
an
even
greater
calamity
kennon
shrugged
and
started
walking
toward
the
craters
edge
copper
followed
he
turned
to
order
her
back
but
the
words
died
on
his
tips
as
he
saw
the
terror
and
determination
on
her
face
neither
commands
nor
pleas
would
move
her
if
he
went
she
would
follow
the
only
way
he
could
stop
her
would
be
with
violence
and
he
didnt
want
to
manhandle
her
he
felt
an
odd
mixture
of
pride
tenderness
and
admiration
for
her
were
their
situations
reversed
he
doubted
whether
he
would
have
the
courage
she
was
showing
he
sighed
perhaps
she
was
right
perhaps
he
did
need
an
antiradiation
suit
all
right
he
said
you
win
ill
get
some
protective
clothing
and
look
at
it
later
her
knees
sagged
but
he
caught
her
before
she
fell
and
held
her
erect
until
her
strength
returned
belatedly
he
understood
the
emotional
strain
that
had
been
gripping
her
if
you
come
back
later
sir
youll
take
me
with
you
the
words
were
a
statement
not
a
question
he
nodded
providing
you
wear
a
radiation
suit
he
said
she
grimaced
with
distaste
and
he
chuckled
clothing
and
copper
simply
didnt
get
along
together
well
all
right
she
said
unhappily
and
theres
one
more
condition
whats
that
she
asked
suspiciously
that
you
tell
me
about
this
place
you
obviously
know
something
about
it
and
with
all
your
talking
youve
never
mentioned
it
to
me
it
is
forbidden
to
talk
of
these
things
to
men
copper
saidand
then
perversely
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
now
noit
can
wait
we
have
come
a
long
way
and
i
am
hungry
i
listen
poorly
on
an
empty
stomach
lets
go
back
to
the
jeep
and
you
can
tell
me
later
copper
smiled
thats
good
she
said
id
feel
better
away
from
this
place
chapter
xiii
i
was
a
poor
learner
of
the
redes
copper
confessed
and
ill
have
to
skip
the
mysteries
i
never
even
tried
to
learn
them
somehow
i
was
sure
id
never
be
a
preceptress
she
settled
herself
more
comfortably
on
the
tawny
grass
and
watched
him
as
he
lay
on
his
back
beside
her
eh
kennon
said
preceptress
the
guardians
of
our
traditions
they
know
the
redes
and
mysteries
by
heart
and
you
have
kept
your
religion
alive
that
way
all
these
years
it
isnt
exactly
religion
copper
said
its
more
like
history
we
learn
it
to
remember
that
we
were
once
a
great
raceand
that
we
may
be
again
someday
there
will
come
a
male
a
leader
to
bring
us
out
of
bondage
and
our
race
will
be
free
of
dependence
on
men
there
will
be
pairings
again
and
freedom
to
live
as
we
please
she
looked
thoughtfully
at
kennon
you
might
even
be
the
oneeven
though
you
are
human
youre
different
from
the
others
youre
prejudiced
kennon
smiled
im
no
different
wellnot
very
different
at
any
rate
that
is
not
my
thought
copper
said
you
are
very
different
indeed
no
man
has
ever
resisted
a
lani
as
long
as
you
have
kennon
shook
his
head
lets
not
go
into
that
now
what
are
these
redes
i
do
not
remember
them
all
copper
apologized
i
was
youve
said
that
before
tell
me
what
you
do
know
i
remember
the
beginning
fairly
well
she
said
it
goes
back
to
the
time
before
flora
when
everything
was
nothing
and
the
master
himself
was
lonely
without
warning
her
voice
changed
to
a
rhythmic
cadenced
chant
that
was
almost
a
song
her
face
became
rapt
and
introspective
as
she
rocked
slowly
from
side
to
side
the
rhythm
was
familiar
and
then
he
recognized
itthe
unintelligible
music
he
had
often
heard
coming
from
the
barracks
late
at
night
when
no
men
were
aroundthe
voiceless
humming
that
the
lani
sang
at
work
first
there
was
darknessstarless
and
sunless
void
without
formdarker
than
night
then
did
the
masterlord
of
creation
wave
his
right
hand
saying
let
there
be
light
verse
kennon
thought
that
was
logical
people
remember
poetry
better
than
prose
but
the
form
was
not
what
hed
normally
expect
it
was
advanced
a
style
that
was
past
primitive
blank
verse
or
heroic
pentameter
he
listened
intently
as
copper
went
on
light
filled
the
heavens
bright
golden
glowing
brought
to
the
void
by
his
wondrous
hand
then
did
the
masterlord
of
creation
nod
his
great
head
saying
let
there
be
land
air
land
and
water
formed
into
being
born
in
the
sight
of
his
allseeing
eyes
then
did
the
masterlord
of
creation
smile
as
he
murmured
let
life
arise
all
of
the
life
conceived
by
the
master
varied
in
shape
as
the
grasses
and
birds
hunters
and
hunted
moveless
and
moving
came
into
form
at
the
sound
of
his
words
thats
a
great
deal
like
genesis
kennon
said
with
mild
astonishment
where
could
you
have
picked
that
up
from
the
beginning
of
our
race
copper
said
it
came
to
us
with
ulf
and
lyssabut
what
is
genesis
a
part
of
an
ancient
religionone
that
is
still
followed
on
some
of
the
central
worlds
its
followers
call
themselves
christians
they
say
it
came
from
earth
the
motherworld
of
men
our
faith
has
no
name
we
are
children
of
lyssa
who
was
a
daughter
of
the
master
it
is
an
odd
similarity
kennon
said
but
other
races
have
had
stories
of
the
creation
and
possibly
there
may
be
another
explanation
your
ancestors
could
have
picked
this
up
from
alexanders
men
they
came
from
earth
originally
and
some
of
them
could
have
been
christians
no
cooper
said
this
rede
is
long
before
man
alexander
it
is
the
origin
of
our
world
even
before
ulf
and
lyssa
it
is
the
first
bookthe
book
of
the
godspell
man
alexander
came
in
the
sixth
bookthe
book
of
roga
theres
no
point
in
arguing
about
it
kennon
said
go
ontell
me
the
rest
its
going
to
be
a
long
story
copper
said
even
though
i
have
forgotten
some
of
it
i
can
chant
the
redes
for
hours
kennon
braced
his
back
against
one
of
the
fat
tires
of
the
jeep
im
a
good
listener
he
said
she
chuckled
you
asked
for
this
she
saidand
took
up
the
verses
where
she
had
left
off
and
kennon
learned
the
lani
version
of
creation
of
the
first
man
and
woman
cast
out
of
heaven
for
loving
each
other
despite
the
masters
objection
of
how
they
came
to
flora
and
founded
the
race
of
the
lani
he
learned
how
the
lani
grew
in
numbers
and
power
how
they
split
into
two
warring
groups
over
the
theological
point
of
whether
ulf
or
lyssa
was
the
principal
deity
how
roga
the
foolish
opened
lyssas
tower
to
find
out
whether
the
ulfians
or
lyssans
were
right
and
brought
the
black
years
to
flora
he
heard
the
trial
of
roga
and
the
details
of
his
torture
by
the
priests
of
ulf
and
the
priests
of
lyssaunited
by
this
greatest
sacrilege
and
he
heard
the
lani
version
of
the
landing
of
alexanders
ship
and
mans
conquest
of
flora
it
was
a
story
of
savagery
and
superstition
of
blood
and
intolerance
of
bravery
and
cowardice
of
love
and
beauty
yet
through
it
all
even
through
the
redes
that
described
the
conquest
there
was
a
curious
remoteness
a
lack
of
emotion
that
made
the
verses
more
terrible
as
they
flowed
in
passionless
rhythm
from
coppers
lips
thats
enough
kennon
said
i
told
you
you
wouldnt
like
it
its
horrible
how
can
you
remember
such
things
we
begin
to
learn
them
as
soon
as
we
can
talk
we
know
the
redes
almost
our
entire
lives
copper
was
silent
for
a
moment
theres
lots
more
she
said
but
its
all
about
our
lives
since
the
man
alexanderthe
old
onetook
possession
of
us
and
most
of
the
newer
redes
are
pretty
dull
our
life
hasnt
changed
much
since
the
men
came
the
book
of
man
is
boring
copper
sighed
i
have
dared
a
great
deal
by
telling
you
these
things
if
the
others
knew
they
would
kill
both
of
us
then
why
tell
me
he
asked
i
love
you
she
said
simply
you
wanted
to
knowand
i
can
deny
you
nothing
a
wave
of
tenderness
swept
over
him
she
would
give
her
life
for
himand
what
would
he
give
nothing
not
even
his
prejudices
his
face
twisted
if
she
was
only
human
if
she
wasnt
just
an
animal
if
he
wasnt
a
betan
if
if
if
resentment
gorged
his
throat
it
was
unfairso
damned
unfair
he
had
no
business
coming
here
he
should
have
stayed
on
beta
or
at
least
on
a
human
world
where
he
would
never
have
met
copper
he
loved
her
but
he
couldnt
have
her
it
was
tantalus
and
sisyphus
rolled
into
one
unsightly
package
and
fastened
to
his
soul
with
a
muttered
curse
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
as
he
did
he
stoppedfrozenstaring
at
copper
as
though
he
had
never
seen
her
before
how
did
you
say
that
roga
was
judged
responsible
for
alexander
coming
here
he
demanded
he
went
into
lyssas
towerwhere
ulf
and
lyssa
tried
to
call
heavenand
with
his
foolish
meddling
set
the
tower
alight
with
a
glow
that
all
could
see
less
than
a
week
later
the
man
alexander
came
where
was
this
tower
where
alexandria
now
stands
man
alexander
destroyed
it
and
built
his
house
upon
its
ruins
and
what
was
that
place
of
the
pit
the
shrine
of
ulfwhere
the
godegg
struck
flora
it
is
buried
in
the
pit
but
the
silent
death
has
protected
it
from
blasphemyand
besides
man
alexander
never
learned
about
it
we
feared
that
he
would
destroy
it
as
he
did
lyssas
tower
a
wild
hope
stirred
in
kennon
were
going
home
he
announced
good
and
were
going
to
get
a
pair
of
radiation
suitsand
then
were
coming
back
well
have
a
good
look
at
that
pit
and
if
whats
in
there
is
what
i
think
it
ishis
face
was
a
mixture
of
grimness
and
eagernesswell
blow
this
whole
operation
off
this
planet
copper
blanched
it
is
death
to
meddle
with
the
godegg
she
said
superstition
kennon
scoffed
if
that
egg
is
what
i
think
it
was
made
by
men
and
you
are
their
descendant
perhaps
youre
right
but
i
cant
help
thinking
you
are
wrong
she
said
soberly
look
at
the
trouble
that
came
with
rogas
meddling
be
careful
that
you
do
not
bring
us
a
worse
fate
ill
be
very
careful
well
take
every
precaution
we
youre
coming
of
course
i
cant
imagine
you
staying
away
copper
nodded
you
shouldnt
worry
so
much
kennon
teased
you
know
we
men
live
forever
that
is
true
and
if
im
right
youre
just
as
human
as
i
and
youre
capable
of
living
as
long
as
i
do
yes
sir
copper
said
her
voice
was
unconvinced
her
expression
noncommittal
you
females
kennon
said
in
quick
exasperation
you
drive
a
man
crazy
get
an
idea
in
your
head
and
it
takes
triatomate
to
blast
it
out
now
lets
go
two
hours
brought
them
back
to
the
volcanic
area
and
knowing
what
to
look
for
kennon
located
the
pockmarked
mountain
valley
from
the
air
it
looked
completely
ordinary
kennon
was
amazed
at
the
perfection
of
the
natural
camouflage
the
pit
was
merely
another
crater
in
the
pitted
ground
he
dropped
to
a
lower
altitude
barely
a
hundred
feet
above
the
sputter
cones
look
he
said
below
them
was
the
crater
of
the
pit
and
in
its
center
a
smooth
bluishblack
hemisphere
protruded
from
the
crater
floor
it
would
have
passed
unnoticed
by
the
casual
eyenearly
concealed
by
two
gigantic
blocks
of
pumice
the
godegg
copper
exclaimed
eggha
thats
a
spacer
i
thought
it
would
be
id
recognize
durilium
anywhere
lets
go
down
and
look
this
over
but
first
we
want
a
couple
of
pictures
he
pointed
a
camera
at
the
crater
and
snapped
the
shutter
therenow
lets
have
a
closer
look
at
our
baby
do
you
expect
me
to
get
into
that
thing
copper
said
distastefully
as
she
prodded
the
shapeless
green
coveralls
with
a
bare
toe
she
eyed
the
helmet
gloves
and
boots
with
equal
distaste
id
suffocate
if
you
want
to
come
with
me
youll
wear
it
kennon
said
otherwise
you
wont
come
near
that
pit
try
it
and
ill
chain
you
to
the
jeep
you
wouldnt
just
try
me
ohall
fight
ill
wear
the
thingbut
i
wont
be
comfortable
who
cares
about
that
youll
be
protected
all
rightshow
me
how
to
put
it
on
id
rather
be
with
you
than
worry
about
what
you
are
doing
the
suit
was
several
sizes
too
large
but
it
covered
her
adequately
too
adequately
kennon
decided
she
looked
like
a
pile
of
wrinkles
with
legs
he
chuckled
she
glared
so
im
funny
she
said
let
me
tell
you
something
else
thats
funny
im
hot
im
sweating
i
itch
nowlaugh
i
dont
feel
like
laughing
kennon
said
i
feel
the
same
way
they
approached
the
edge
of
the
pit
carefully
kennon
kept
checking
the
radiation
counter
the
needle
slowly
rose
and
steadied
at
onehalf
roentgen
per
hour
as
he
thrust
the
probe
over
the
rim
of
the
depression
its
fine
so
far
he
said
encouragingly
we
could
take
this
much
for
quite
a
while
even
without
suits
he
lowered
himself
over
the
edge
sliding
down
the
gentle
slope
how
is
it
down
there
copper
called
the
intercom
crackled
in
his
ear
finebarely
over
one
roentgen
per
hour
with
these
suits
we
could
stay
here
indefinitely
the
sigh
of
relief
was
music
in
her
ears
this
place
is
barely
lukewarm
thats
what
you
think
copper
said
i
mean
radiation
warm
kennon
said
stay
up
there
and
watch
me
i
may
need
some
things
all
right
copper
squirmed
inside
the
hot
suit
the
thing
was
an
oven
she
hoped
that
kennon
didnt
plan
to
work
in
the
daytime
it
would
be
impossible
kennon
gingerly
approached
the
ship
it
was
half
buried
in
the
loose
debris
and
ash
that
had
fallen
or
blown
into
the
pit
during
the
centuries
it
had
rested
there
it
was
oldincredibly
old
the
hull
design
was
ancientriveted
sheets
of
millimeterthick
durilium
ships
hadnt
been
built
like
that
in
over
two
thousand
years
and
the
ovoid
shape
was
reminiscent
of
the
even
more
ancient
spindizzy
design
a
hyperspace
converter
like
that
couldnt
be
less
than
four
millennia
old
it
was
a
museum
piece
but
the
blueblack
hull
was
as
smooth
and
unblemished
as
the
day
it
had
left
fabrication
space
travel
would
have
gotten
nowhere
without
durilium
kennon
reflected
for
five
thousand
years
men
had
used
the
incredibly
tough
synthetic
to
build
their
spacecraft
it
had
given
man
his
empire
kennon
gave
the
hull
one
quick
glance
that
part
of
the
ship
didnt
worry
him
it
was
what
he
would
find
inside
that
bothered
him
how
much
damage
had
occurred
from
two
thousand
or
more
years
of
disuse
how
much
had
the
original
travelers
cannibalized
how
much
could
be
salvaged
what
sort
of
records
remained
there
were
a
thousand
questions
that
the
interior
of
that
enigmatic
hull
might
answer
the
upper
segment
of
the
airlock
was
visible
it
was
closed
which
was
a
good
sign
a
few
hours
work
with
a
digger
should
expose
it
enough
to
be
opened
copper
he
said
were
going
to
have
to
dig
this
out
theres
a
small
excavator
in
the
cargo
bed
of
the
jeep
do
you
think
you
can
bring
it
down
here
i
think
so
good
girl
kennon
turned
back
to
the
ship
he
was
eager
to
enter
it
there
might
be
things
inside
that
would
settle
the
question
of
the
lani
the
original
crew
had
probably
recognized
the
value
of
the
hull
as
a
repository
as
well
as
he
did
but
in
the
meantime
there
would
be
worklots
of
it
and
every
step
must
be
recorded
it
was
the
rest
of
the
days
work
to
expose
the
emergency
airlock
the
little
excavator
toiled
over
the
loose
ash
for
hours
before
it
displaced
enough
to
make
the
port
visible
and
the
ash
was
not
yet
cleared
away
sufficiently
to
open
the
portal
when
darkness
brought
a
halt
to
the
work
it
would
be
impossible
to
unearth
the
spaceship
with
their
lowcapacity
digger
kennon
decided
it
would
be
difficult
enough
to
clear
the
emergency
airlock
in
the
nose
but
if
the
tubes
and
drive
were
still
all
right
by
careful
handling
it
should
be
possible
to
use
the
drive
to
blast
out
the
loose
ash
and
cinders
which
surrounded
the
hull
kennon
reluctantly
gave
up
the
idea
of
entering
the
spaceship
that
would
have
to
wait
until
tomorrow
now
they
would
have
to
conceal
the
work
and
call
it
a
day
a
few
branches
and
the
big
blocks
of
pumice
would
suffice
for
temporary
camouflage
later
they
could
make
something
better
anything
in
the
jeep
which
might
be
useful
was
cached
along
with
the
radiation
suits
in
the
passageway
through
the
lava
walland
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
they
were
heading
homeward
kennon
was
not
too
displeased
tomorrow
they
would
be
able
to
enter
the
ship
tomorrow
they
would
probably
have
some
of
the
answers
to
his
questions
he
looked
ahead
into
the
gathering
night
the
gray
mass
of
the
abandoned
olympus
station
slipped
below
them
as
he
lined
the
jeep
along
the
path
indicated
by
the
luminous
arrow
atop
the
main
building
set
the
controls
on
automatic
and
locked
the
craft
on
the
guide
beacon
in
alexandrias
tower
in
a
little
less
than
an
hour
they
would
be
home
chapter
xiv
kennon
was
morally
certain
that
the
lani
were
of
human
stock
evolved
of
course
mutated
genetic
strangers
to
the
rest
of
humanity
but
human
the
spaceship
and
the
redes
proved
it
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
but
moral
certainty
and
legal
certainty
were
two
different
things
what
he
believed
might
be
good
enough
to
hold
up
in
a
brotherhood
court
but
he
doubted
it
ulf
and
lyssa
might
be
the
founders
of
the
lani
race
but
they
had
come
to
kardon
nearly
four
thousand
years
ago
and
no
records
existed
to
prove
that
the
lani
werent
here
before
they
came
redes
passed
by
word
of
mouth
through
hundreds
of
generations
were
not
evidence
even
the
spaceship
wasnt
the
absolute
proof
that
would
be
needed
to
overturn
the
earlier
legal
decision
other
and
better
proof
was
neededsomething
that
would
stand
up
in
any
court
in
the
brotherhood
he
hoped
the
spaceship
would
hold
that
proof
but
kennons
eagerness
to
find
out
what
was
inside
the
ancient
spacer
was
tempered
by
hard
practicality
too
much
depended
on
what
he
might
find
inside
that
hull
every
step
of
the
work
must
be
documented
beyond
any
refutation
some
method
of
establishing
date
time
and
location
had
to
be
prepared
there
must
be
a
record
of
every
action
and
that
would
require
equipment
and
planning
there
must
be
no
mistake
that
could
be
twisted
by
the
skillful
counsel
that
alexander
undoubtedly
retained
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
family
would
fight
too
much
money
and
prestige
were
involved
to
prove
the
lani
human
would
destroy
outworld
enterprises
on
kardon
yet
this
thought
did
not
bother
him
to
his
surprise
he
had
no
qualms
of
conscience
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
violate
his
contract
break
faith
with
his
employers
and
plot
their
ruin
the
higher
duty
came
firstthe
duty
to
the
human
race
he
smiled
wryly
it
wasnt
all
higher
duty
there
were
some
personal
desires
that
leavened
the
nobility
to
prove
copper
human
was
enough
motivationactually
it
was
better
than
his
sense
of
duty
events
kennon
reflected
cause
a
great
deal
of
change
in
ones
attitude
although
not
by
nature
a
plotter
schemes
had
been
flitting
through
his
mind
with
machinelike
regularity
to
be
examined
and
discarded
or
to
be
set
aside
for
future
reference
he
rejected
the
direct
approach
it
was
too
dangerous
depended
too
much
on
personalities
and
had
too
little
chance
for
success
he
considered
the
possibility
of
letters
to
the
brotherhood
council
but
ultimately
rejected
it
not
only
was
the
proof
legally
insufficient
to
establish
humanity
in
the
lani
but
he
also
remembered
alexanders
incredible
knowledge
of
his
activities
and
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
his
present
didnt
receive
the
same
scrutiny
as
the
past
and
if
he
who
hadnt
written
a
letter
in
over
a
year
suddenly
began
to
write
the
correspondence
would
undoubtedly
be
regarded
with
suspicion
and
would
probably
be
examined
and
dirac
messages
would
be
out
for
the
same
reason
he
could
take
a
vacation
and
while
he
was
away
from
the
island
he
could
inform
the
brotherhood
leaving
flora
wouldnt
be
particularly
difficult
but
leaving
kardon
would
be
virtually
impossible
his
contract
called
for
vacations
but
it
expressly
provided
that
they
would
be
taken
on
kardon
and
again
there
would
be
no
assurance
that
his
activities
would
not
be
watched
in
fact
it
was
probable
that
they
would
be
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
immediately
but
there
were
certain
longrange
measures
that
could
be
started
he
could
begin
preparing
a
case
that
could
be
presented
to
the
council
and
beta
when
it
knew
would
help
him
the
situation
of
the
lani
was
so
close
to
betas
own
that
its
obvious
merit
as
a
test
case
simply
could
not
be
ignored
if
he
could
get
the
evidence
to
beta
it
would
be
easy
to
enlist
the
aid
of
the
entire
medicotechnological
civilization
it
would
take
time
and
attention
to
detail
the
case
the
evidence
everything
would
have
to
be
prepared
with
every
safeguard
and
contingency
provided
so
that
there
would
not
be
the
slightest
chance
of
a
slipup
once
it
came
to
court
and
perhaps
the
best
method
of
bringing
the
evidence
would
be
to
transport
it
under
its
own
power
the
thought
intrigued
him
actually
it
wouldnt
be
too
difficult
externally
the
egg
wasnt
in
bad
shape
the
virtually
indestructible
durilium
hull
was
still
intact
the
controls
and
the
engines
hermetically
sealed
inside
the
hull
were
probably
as
good
as
the
day
they
stopped
running
the
circuitry
would
undoubtedly
be
bad
but
it
could
be
repaired
and
restored
and
new
fuel
slugs
could
be
obtained
for
the
engine
and
the
converter
but
that
was
a
problem
for
the
future
the
immediate
problem
was
to
get
into
the
ship
in
a
properly
documented
fashion
it
took
nearly
two
months
but
finally
under
the
impersonal
lenses
of
cameras
and
recorders
the
entrance
port
of
the
godegg
swung
open
and
revealed
the
dark
interior
kennon
moved
carefully
recording
every
step
as
he
entered
the
black
orifice
in
the
spaceships
side
his
handtorch
gave
plenty
of
light
for
the
recorders
as
he
moved
insidecopper
at
his
heels
both
of
them
physically
unrecognizable
in
antiradiation
suits
why
are
we
moving
so
slowly
copper
said
lets
go
ahead
and
find
out
whats
beyond
this
passageway
from
a
superstitious
coward
youve
certainly
become
a
reckless
explorer
he
said
the
egg
hasnt
hurt
us
and
weve
been
around
it
many
times
she
said
either
the
curse
has
become
too
old
to
hurt
us
or
there
never
was
any
in
the
first
place
so
lets
see
what
is
ahead
im
curious
kennon
shook
his
head
in
this
business
we
must
hurry
slowlyvery
slowly
you
know
why
but
i
want
to
see
patience
girl
simmer
down
youll
see
soon
enough
kennon
said
now
help
me
set
up
this
camera
oh
all
rightbut
isnt
there
any
excitement
in
you
im
bubbling
over
with
it
kennon
admitted
but
i
manage
to
keep
it
under
control
youre
coldblooded
noim
sensible
we
want
to
nail
this
down
my
future
yours
and
that
of
your
people
depend
upon
how
carefully
we
work
you
wouldnt
want
to
let
us
all
down
by
being
too
eager
would
you
she
shook
her
head
noyoure
right
of
course
but
i
still
would
like
to
see
they
moved
cautiously
through
the
airlock
and
into
the
control
room
ah
kennon
said
with
satisfaction
i
hoped
for
this
but
i
didnt
dare
expect
it
what
look
around
what
do
you
see
nothing
but
an
empty
room
its
shaped
like
half
an
orange
and
it
has
a
lot
of
funny
instruments
and
dials
on
the
walls
and
a
video
screen
overhead
but
thats
all
whywhats
so
unusual
about
it
it
looks
just
like
someone
had
left
it
thats
the
point
theres
nothing
essential
thats
missing
they
didnt
cannibalize
the
instrumentsand
they
didnt
come
back
why
not
maybe
because
that
curse
you
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago
was
real
copper
drew
back
but
you
said
it
wouldnt
hurt
us
not
now
the
heats
practically
gone
but
when
whoever
flew
this
crate
came
here
the
whole
shell
could
have
been
as
hot
as
a
samarian
summer
but
couldnt
they
have
come
back
when
it
cooled
not
with
this
kind
of
heat
the
hull
was
probably
too
radioactive
to
approach
from
the
outside
and
radioactivity
cools
off
slowly
it
might
take
several
lifetimes
for
its
level
to
become
low
enough
to
approach
if
there
was
no
decontamination
equipment
available
i
suppose
thats
why
the
early
ones
thought
the
egg
was
cursed
kennon
nodded
now
lets
checkoh
oh
whats
this
he
pointed
to
a
metalbacked
book
lying
on
the
control
panel
it
looks
like
a
book
copper
said
im
hoping
its
the
book
the
book
yesthe
ships
log
its
possible
and
if
it
is
we
may
have
all
the
evidence
we
needcopperdont
touch
it
why
not
because
its
position
has
to
be
recorded
first
wait
until
we
get
the
camera
and
recorders
set
up
gingerly
kennon
opened
the
ancient
book
the
sheets
inside
were
brittlecrumbling
with
agebut
he
could
make
out
the
title
unss
wanderer
with
the
date
of
launching
and
a
lower
line
which
read
ships
log
kennon
was
thankful
for
his
medical
training
the
four
years
of
classical
english
that
he
had
despised
so
much
were
essential
now
stumbling
over
unfamiliar
words
and
phrases
he
moved
slowly
through
the
log
tracing
the
old
ships
history
from
pleasure
craft
to
shorthaul
freight
tractor
to
obsolescence
in
a
space
dump
orbiting
around
a
world
called
heaven
there
was
a
gap
of
nearly
ten
years
indicated
by
a
blank
page
before
the
entries
resumed
ahthis
is
it
kennon
said
what
is
it
copper
said
curiously
i
cant
read
the
writing
of
course
you
cant
its
in
englisha
language
that
became
obsolete
during
the
interregnum
i
had
to
learn
it
since
most
medical
terminology
is
based
on
it
what
is
an
interregnum
copper
interrupted
ive
never
heard
that
word
before
its
a
period
of
confusion
when
there
is
no
stable
government
the
last
one
came
after
the
second
galactic
warbut
never
mind
thatit
happened
long
ago
and
isnt
important
now
the
important
thing
that
did
happen
was
the
exodus
what
was
that
a
religious
revival
and
a
tremendous
desire
to
see
what
was
happening
beyond
the
next
star
during
that
century
men
traveled
wider
and
farther
then
they
ever
have
before
or
since
in
that
outward
explosion
with
its
mixed
motivations
of
religion
and
practicality
colonists
and
missionaries
went
starward
to
find
new
worlds
to
tame
and
new
races
to
be
rescued
from
the
darkness
of
idolatry
and
hell
almost
any
sort
of
vehicle
capable
of
mounting
a
spindizzy
converter
was
pressed
into
service
the
old
spindizzies
were
soundly
engineered
converters
of
almost
childlike
simplicity
that
could
and
did
carry
ships
enormous
distances
if
their
passengers
didnt
care
about
subjective
timelag
and
a
little
radioactivity
and
thats
what
happened
to
this
ship
according
to
this
log
it
was
bought
by
alfred
and
melissa
weyganda
missionary
couple
with
the
idea
of
spreading
the
christian
faith
to
the
heathen
alfred
and
melissaulf
and
lyssathey
were
a
part
of
this
ancient
explosion
that
scattered
human
seed
across
parsecs
of
interstellar
space
it
seems
that
they
were
a
unit
in
a
missionary
fleet
that
had
gone
out
to
the
stars
with
flame
in
their
hearts
and
gospel
on
their
lips
to
bring
the
word
to
the
benighted
heathen
on
other
worlds
kennons
lips
curled
with
mild
contempt
at
their
stupid
foolhardiness
even
as
his
pulse
quickened
to
their
bravery
they
had
been
fanatics
true
enough
but
theirs
was
a
selfless
fanaticism
that
would
risk
torture
and
death
for
what
they
believeda
fanaticism
that
was
more
sublime
than
the
concept
of
brotherhood
which
had
evolved
from
it
they
knew
nothing
of
the
enmity
of
race
of
the
incessant
struggle
man
had
since
waged
with
alien
intelligences
all
too
willing
to
destroy
intruders
who
encroached
upon
their
worlds
mankinds
early
selflessness
had
long
ago
been
discarded
for
frank
expansionism
and
dominance
over
the
lesser
races
that
stood
in
their
way
and
in
a
way
it
was
too
bad
the
ships
log
meticulously
kept
in
neat
round
english
script
told
a
story
that
was
more
than
the
bare
bones
of
flight
there
was
passion
and
tenderness
and
a
spiritual
quality
that
was
shocking
to
a
modern
man
steeped
in
millennia
of
conquest
and
selfinterest
there
was
a
greatness
to
it
a
depth
of
faith
that
had
since
been
lost
and
as
kennon
slowly
deciphered
the
ancient
script
he
admired
the
courage
even
as
his
mind
winced
with
dismay
at
the
unheeding
recklessness
the
weygands
had
lost
contact
with
the
others
and
had
searched
for
them
in
hyperspace
doubling
and
twisting
upon
their
course
until
they
had
become
hopelessly
lost
and
then
with
their
fuel
nearly
exhausted
had
broken
out
into
the
normal
threespace
continuum
to
find
kardons
sun
and
the
world
they
called
flora
how
little
they
had
known
and
how
lucky
they
had
been
it
was
only
by
the
grace
of
their
god
that
they
had
found
this
world
before
their
fuel
was
exhausted
and
it
was
only
by
further
grace
that
the
planet
was
habitable
and
not
populated
with
intelligent
life
they
had
more
luck
than
people
were
entitled
to
in
a
dozen
lifetimes
against
odds
of
a
million
to
one
they
had
survived
it
was
fascinating
reading
but
it
was
not
proof
the
last
entry
read
we
have
circled
this
world
and
have
seen
no
buildingsno
sign
of
intelligent
life
we
are
lost
marooned
on
this
empty
world
our
fuel
supplies
are
too
low
for
us
to
attempt
to
find
the
others
nor
could
we
the
constellations
in
the
sky
are
strange
we
do
not
know
which
way
to
go
therefore
we
shall
land
upon
the
great
island
in
the
center
of
the
yellow
sea
and
perhaps
someday
men
will
come
to
us
since
we
cannot
return
to
them
melissa
thinks
that
this
is
an
example
of
divine
providence
that
the
lords
mercy
has
been
shown
to
us
that
were
lost
in
the
vastness
of
the
deepthat
we
have
been
chosen
like
eve
and
adam
to
spread
the
seed
of
man
to
yet
another
world
i
hope
she
is
right
yet
i
fear
the
radiation
level
of
the
ship
has
become
inordinately
high
we
may
well
be
eve
and
adam
yet
an
adam
that
cannot
beget
and
an
eve
that
is
not
fruitful
i
am
trimming
the
ship
for
landing
and
we
shall
leave
it
immediately
after
we
have
landed
taking
with
us
only
what
we
absolutely
need
there
is
too
much
radiation
from
the
spindizzy
and
the
drive
to
remain
here
longerand
god
knows
how
hot
the
outer
hull
may
be
and
that
was
all
presumptive
evidenceyes
reasonable
certaintyyes
but
not
proof
lawyers
could
argue
that
since
no
direct
exploration
was
made
there
was
no
valid
reason
to
assume
that
the
lani
did
not
already
inhabit
kardon
but
kennon
knew
his
body
more
perceptive
than
his
mind
had
realized
a
truth
that
his
brain
would
not
accept
until
he
read
the
log
it
was
at
once
joy
and
frustration
joy
that
copper
was
human
frustration
that
he
could
not
obtain
for
her
and
her
race
the
rights
to
which
they
were
entitled
but
the
immediate
problem
was
solved
his
conditioning
was
broken
now
he
was
convinced
that
copper
was
a
member
of
the
human
race
it
was
no
violation
of
his
code
to
love
her
the
greatest
barrier
was
broken
and
with
it
gone
the
lesser
ones
would
yield
relief
that
was
almost
pain
washed
through
him
and
left
him
weak
with
reaction
what
is
it
copper
asked
as
he
turned
to
her
what
is
this
thing
that
has
turned
your
face
to
joy
cant
you
guess
she
shook
her
head
i
have
seen
nothing
but
you
reading
this
ancient
book
yet
you
turn
to
me
with
the
look
in
your
eyes
that
the
redes
say
ulf
had
for
lyssa
youre
human
copper
shrugged
youre
mad
im
a
lani
i
was
born
a
laniand
i
shall
die
one
dont
you
understand
all
lani
are
human
you
all
are
the
descendants
of
two
humans
who
came
here
thousands
of
years
ago
then
there
is
no
reason
why
you
cannot
love
me
kennon
shook
his
head
no
he
said
there
is
no
reason
copper
laughed
it
was
a
sound
so
merry
and
gay
that
kennon
looked
at
her
in
surprise
she
looked
as
happy
as
she
sounded
simple
and
savage
kennon
thought
she
cared
nothing
for
the
future
and
probably
very
little
about
the
injustice
of
her
present
the
thing
that
mattered
was
that
what
had
kept
them
apart
was
gone
she
was
probably
offering
mental
sacrifices
to
the
old
ones
who
had
caused
this
change
in
the
man
she
loved
she
didnt
really
care
about
what
had
caused
the
change
to
her
it
was
sufficient
that
it
had
happened
for
a
moment
kennon
wished
that
it
could
be
as
simple
for
him
as
it
apparently
was
for
her
the
fact
that
copper
was
human
posed
a
greater
problem
than
the
one
it
solved
the
one
had
been
personal
the
other
was
infinitely
greater
he
could
not
let
it
lie
the
very
morality
which
had
kept
him
from
doing
what
he
wished
when
he
thought
she
was
a
humanoid
now
forced
him
to
do
what
he
did
not
wish
every
instinct
said
to
leave
it
alone
the
problem
was
too
great
for
one
man
to
solve
the
situation
too
complicated
the
evidence
too
inconclusive
the
opposition
too
powerful
it
would
be
far
better
to
take
his
happiness
and
enjoy
it
it
was
not
his
problem
to
solve
he
could
turn
the
evidence
over
to
the
brotherhood
once
his
contract
was
over
and
better
and
more
capable
people
than
he
could
settle
the
lani
legal
status
but
the
inner
voice
that
had
called
him
bestial
now
called
him
shirker
coward
and
slacker
and
this
too
could
not
be
borne
the
case
of
the
lani
would
have
to
be
pursued
as
vigorously
as
he
could
do
it
they
were
entitled
to
human
rightswhether
they
wanted
them
or
not
his
first
idea
of
making
the
spacer
operational
was
a
good
one
kennon
decided
as
they
finished
the
inspection
of
the
ship
even
if
it
was
never
used
it
would
make
a
good
means
of
retreat
he
grinned
wryly
in
a
guerrilla
operation
such
as
the
one
he
was
considering
it
would
be
wise
to
have
a
way
out
if
things
got
too
hot
the
heavy
parts
the
engines
and
the
controls
were
in
workable
condition
and
would
merely
require
cleaning
and
oiling
some
of
the
optical
equipment
would
have
to
be
replaced
and
fuel
slugs
would
have
to
be
obtained
for
the
drivebut
none
of
these
would
be
too
hard
to
accomplish
the
slugs
from
any
of
the
power
reactors
on
the
island
would
serve
nicely
all
that
would
have
to
be
done
would
be
to
modify
the
fuel
ports
on
the
ships
engine
the
spindizzy
would
have
to
be
disassembled
and
checked
and
the
main
leads
embedded
in
timeresistant
plastic
would
have
to
be
examined
the
most
serious
problem
however
wouldnt
involve
these
things
the
control
board
wiring
and
circuitry
was
where
the
trouble
would
lie
normal
insulation
and
printed
circuitry
wasnt
designed
to
last
for
thousands
of
years
each
wired
circuit
would
have
to
be
removed
duplicated
and
replaced
every
printed
panel
would
have
to
be
cleaned
and
receive
a
new
coat
of
insulating
varnish
working
full
time
a
fourman
electronics
team
could
do
the
job
in
a
week
working
parttime
the
two
of
them
might
get
it
done
in
three
months
and
the
other
jobs
would
take
at
least
another
add
a
month
for
errors
in
judgment
lack
of
materials
and
mistakesand
another
for
unavoidable
delaysit
would
be
at
least
six
months
before
the
egg
would
be
spaceworthy
six
months
not
too
long
if
everything
went
well
but
far
too
long
if
there
were
any
mistakes
he
would
have
to
be
careful
yet
he
must
not
give
the
impression
of
being
careful
he
shook
his
head
being
a
subversive
was
going
to
require
a
greater
amount
of
acting
ability
than
he
had
ever
been
called
upon
to
display
and
what
of
copper
how
would
she
behave
under
the
double
strain
of
knowledge
that
she
was
human
and
knowledge
of
the
spaceship
women
werent
noted
for
their
tightlipped
reticence
would
she
tell
the
other
lani
would
she
crack
under
the
pressure
did
she
have
the
qualities
of
a
good
conspirator
as
it
turned
out
he
didnt
need
to
worry
as
a
partner
in
crime
copper
was
all
that
could
be
wished
everything
was
normal
she
was
still
obedient
helpful
and
gay
as
ever
to
watch
her
no
one
would
ever
think
that
her
bright
head
was
full
of
knowledge
that
could
rock
flora
to
its
foundations
never
by
look
or
word
did
she
betray
the
slightest
trace
of
strain
or
guilt
and
in
her
other
moments
she
was
ecstatic
in
her
love
and
helpful
with
the
repair
work
on
the
egg
whenever
kennon
could
get
time
to
visit
the
old
spaceship
you
amaze
me
kennon
said
as
they
eased
the
cover
of
the
spindizzy
in
place
and
spun
the
bolts
on
the
lugs
that
held
it
to
the
outer
shielding
he
picked
up
a
heavy
wrench
and
began
methodically
to
seat
the
bolts
as
copper
wiped
the
white
extrusion
of
the
cover
sealant
from
the
shining
case
how
the
way
you
hide
your
knowledge
of
this
ship
from
the
others
i
know
you
better
than
anyone
else
on
this
island
and
yet
you
would
fool
me
we
lani
are
used
to
hiding
things
you
men
have
been
our
masters
for
centuries
yet
you
do
not
know
our
redes
nor
do
you
know
what
we
think
we
obey
you
but
there
are
parts
of
us
you
do
not
own
it
is
easy
to
hide
a
little
thing
like
this
kennon
nodded
it
figured
he
seated
another
bolt
three
more
and
the
drive
room
would
be
restored
and
they
could
start
on
the
control
circuits
i
wish
you
were
as
clever
about
adopting
human
customs
as
you
are
about
hiding
guilty
knowledge
he
said
copper
laughed
you
mean
those
silly
things
you
have
been
teaching
me
why
should
i
learn
them
im
happy
as
i
am
i
love
you
you
love
me
and
that
is
all
that
matters
its
not
all
that
matters
cant
you
get
it
through
your
head
that
civilized
customs
are
necessary
in
a
civilized
society
he
gave
the
nexttolast
bolt
an
extravicious
wrench
youll
have
to
know
them
if
you
expect
to
get
along
on
beta
but
i
will
never
see
beta
i
am
going
there
when
my
duty
here
is
over
and
youre
going
with
me
when
will
that
be
three
years
so
long
wellwe
can
think
of
it
then
but
i
dont
think
man
alexander
will
let
you
take
me
then
i
shall
take
you
without
his
consent
she
smiled
it
would
be
easier
to
stay
here
in
another
fifteen
years
i
will
be
old
and
you
will
not
want
me
ill
never
do
that
ill
always
want
you
you
swear
too
easily
she
said
gently
you
men
live
forever
we
lani
are
a
shortlived
race
but
you
neednt
be
its
obviously
its
been
tried
my
loveand
those
who
were
treated
died
man
alexander
tried
many
years
ago
to
make
us
longlived
like
you
but
he
failed
you
see
he
loved
one
of
us
too
but
let
us
think
no
more
of
it
let
us
enjoy
what
we
have
and
be
grateful
to
the
gods
for
the
love
we
enjoyor
do
you
have
any
gods
one
two
are
better
more
anyway
and
besides
ulf
and
lyssa
and
the
godegg
are
responsible
for
our
joy
they
are
indeed
kennon
said
then
why
should
you
think
of
leaving
the
place
where
they
rule
you
should
stay
here
there
will
be
other
lani
when
i
am
gone
you
will
be
happy
always
not
without
you
kennon
said
dont
you
understand
that
i
love
you
and
i
you
but
i
am
a
lani
you
are
a
man
youre
as
human
as
i
am
kennon
said
abruptly
that
is
what
you
say
copper
replied
i
am
not
so
sure
i
need
more
proof
than
this
she
waved
her
hand
at
the
ship
what
proof
do
you
need
the
same
as
the
proof
you
men
require
if
i
should
have
your
child
then
i
would
believe
that
i
was
human
ive
told
you
a
thousand
times
that
the
radiation
on
this
ship
must
have
affected
ulf
and
lyssas
germ
plasm
cant
you
understand
that
i
can
understand
it
all
right
but
it
does
not
change
things
ulf
and
lyssa
may
have
been
human
before
they
came
here
but
they
were
not
when
they
landed
they
were
lani
and
their
children
were
lani
but
they
were
of
human
stock
the
law
that
lets
men
become
our
masters
does
not
agree
with
you
then
the
law
is
wrong
it
should
be
changed
copper
shrugged
two
people
cannot
change
a
law
they
can
tryparticularly
if
the
law
is
unjust
copper
sighed
is
it
not
enough
for
us
to
love
must
you
try
to
run
through
a
wall
when
the
wall
stands
in
the
way
of
right
and
justice
i
must
copper
looked
at
him
with
pity
in
her
green
eyes
this
i
do
not
understand
i
know
nothing
of
right
and
justice
what
are
these
things
just
words
yet
you
will
endanger
our
happiness
for
them
if
it
is
my
happiness
you
wishthen
leave
this
foolishness
alone
i
have
fifteen
years
i
can
live
with
you
before
i
am
old
and
you
tire
of
me
with
those
years
i
can
be
content
but
i
cant
kennon
said
call
me
selfish
if
you
wish
but
i
want
you
with
me
as
long
as
i
live
i
dont
want
to
live
my
life
without
you
you
want
too
much
copper
said
softly
but
if
it
makes
you
happy
to
try
to
get
it
i
shall
help
and
if
we
do
not
succeed
you
will
at
least
be
happier
for
trying
and
if
you
are
happyshe
shruggedthen
the
rest
makes
little
difference
that
was
the
crux
of
the
matter
kennon
reflected
bitterly
he
was
convinced
she
was
human
she
was
not
and
until
her
mind
could
be
changed
on
that
point
she
would
help
him
but
her
heart
wouldnt
be
in
it
and
the
only
thing
that
would
convince
her
that
she
was
human
would
be
a
childa
child
of
his
begetting
he
could
perhaps
trick
her
with
an
artificial
insemination
of
lani
sperm
there
were
drugs
that
could
suspend
consciousness
hypnotics
that
would
make
her
believe
anything
she
was
told
while
under
their
influence
but
in
the
end
it
would
do
no
good
all
witnesses
in
brotherhood
court
actions
were
examined
under
psychoprobe
and
a
hypnotic
was
of
no
value
against
a
lie
detector
that
could
extract
the
deepest
buried
truth
and
he
would
be
examined
too
the
truth
would
outand
nothing
would
be
gained
in
facteverything
would
be
lost
the
attempt
at
trickery
would
prejudice
any
court
against
the
honest
evidence
they
had
so
painfully
collected
he
sighed
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
go
on
as
they
wereand
hope
that
the
evidence
would
hold
with
betan
legal
talent
at
their
back
it
might
and
of
course
they
could
try
to
produce
a
child
as
nature
had
intended
they
could
trybut
kennon
knew
it
would
not
succeed
it
never
had
chapter
xv
copper
had
been
acting
strangely
of
late
kennon
thought
as
he
rolled
over
in
his
bed
and
watched
her
standing
before
the
fulllength
mirror
on
the
bathroom
door
she
pivoted
slowly
before
the
glass
eying
herself
critically
raising
her
arms
over
her
head
holding
them
at
her
sides
flexing
her
supple
spine
and
tightening
muscles
that
moved
like
silken
cords
beneath
her
golden
skin
what
are
you
trying
to
dobecome
a
muscle
dancer
kennon
asked
idly
she
whirled
a
crimson
blush
deepening
the
tan
of
her
face
you
were
supposed
to
be
asleep
she
said
im
an
unregenerate
heel
he
replied
and
i
dont
sleep
too
well
nowadays
unless
youre
beside
me
welli
suppose
you
might
as
well
know
now
as
later
she
said
youll
know
in
any
event
know
what
that
youre
right
i
am
human
and
what
brought
on
this
sudden
change
of
he
stopped
abruptly
his
eyes
widening
yes
copper
said
i
am
with
child
your
child
but
thats
impossible
she
shook
her
head
its
a
miracle
perhaps
but
its
not
impossible
its
happened
cant
you
see
the
difference
see
what
you
look
just
as
you
always
do
i
suppose
you
cant
see
it
yet
she
admitted
but
i
am
with
child
im
two
weeks
past
my
time
kennons
mind
leaped
to
the
obvious
conclusion
pseudopregnancy
he
had
seen
it
before
among
lani
at
hillside
farm
it
was
an
odd
syndrome
which
occasionally
occurred
in
humans
and
animals
the
brain
desiring
children
made
demands
upon
the
body
and
the
body
responded
to
its
desire
by
tricking
the
brain
lani
were
fairly
subject
to
its
probably
because
they
had
better
imaginations
he
would
run
a
few
tests
when
they
went
down
to
the
hospital
and
once
she
realized
the
practical
joke
her
body
was
playing
everything
would
be
all
right
no
wonder
she
seemed
excited
well
find
out
about
that
later
he
said
equably
well
settle
this
when
we
get
back
to
the
hospital
copper
smiled
confidently
and
patted
her
stomach
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
but
youre
wrong
we
lani
know
about
these
things
in
forty
generations
i
am
the
first
to
conceive
as
the
master
intended
i
hope
you
havent
kennon
said
with
such
bitter
sincerity
that
copper
looked
at
him
wideeyed
not
now
because
if
you
have
neither
your
life
nor
mine
is
safe
why
the
alexanders
do
you
think
theyll
take
it
lying
down
were
not
ready
for
them
yet
theyll
fight
and
the
first
thing
theyll
do
is
kill
you
and
erase
me
so
we
would
never
be
able
to
talk
you
have
been
declared
an
animal
and
you
will
not
be
allowed
to
change
what
can
we
do
copper
asked
she
shivered
i
do
not
want
to
die
nor
do
i
want
you
to
kennon
said
i
could
tell
the
others
and
just
what
would
that
accomplish
in
a
week
every
lani
on
the
island
would
know
it
there
would
be
revolt
for
the
lani
would
no
longer
be
dependent
upon
men
to
survive
their
greatest
hold
on
us
would
be
gone
and
we
would
be
free
again
on
our
island
world
you
would
not
kennon
said
that
sort
of
thinking
is
foolishness
alexander
would
have
men
here
within
a
week
and
a
week
after
that
you
would
be
smashed
dont
you
realize
that
there
are
thousands
of
millions
of
men
in
the
galaxyand
to
every
one
of
them
you
would
be
animals
you
know
nothing
about
what
you
would
face
your
puny
hundreds
couldnt
even
stand
against
a
fraction
of
the
power
alexander
could
mount
against
you
have
you
seen
a
burkholtz
blaster
work
have
you
seen
remotecontrol
antipersonnel
missiles
have
you
pushpull
projectors
atomic
warheads
all
of
these
weapons
alexander
can
command
dont
you
realize
hes
an
entrepreneurone
of
the
most
powerful
men
in
this
sector
copper
shook
her
head
no
she
said
in
a
small
voice
i
know
nothing
about
these
things
and
do
you
think
forty
generations
of
absolute
obedience
to
men
can
be
overcome
because
one
lani
says
she
is
pregnant
by
a
man
copper
frowned
you
put
that
in
a
different
way
you
talk
as
if
it
were
my
belief
rather
than
the
truth
what
is
truth
kennon
said
heavily
who
would
believe
you
there
are
hundreds
of
others
with
child
sure
youre
human
you
know
it
i
know
it
ive
been
trying
to
convince
you
for
the
past
two
months
youre
just
as
human
as
i
am
but
pray
that
youre
not
pregnant
we
cant
get
out
of
here
in
less
than
four
months
and
by
then
everybody
will
know
about
you
someone
will
certainly
check
the
records
and
after
that
will
come
the
psychoprobes
everything
will
come
to
light
the
egg
will
be
destroyed
i
will
be
erased
you
will
be
dead
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
he
looked
down
at
her
with
an
odd
expression
of
pity
on
his
face
you
see
he
demanded
harshly
copper
nodded
i
didnt
understand
she
said
dont
be
angry
with
me
i
shouldnt
have
told
you
i
thought
youd
be
happy
i
was
never
angry
with
you
but
i
am
with
myself
i
was
stupid
i
didnt
figure
on
the
remote
possibility
that
we
might
be
genetically
compatible
i
should
have
my
head
examined
for
putting
you
in
such
danger
however
theres
the
possibilitythe
probabilitythat
your
body
is
playing
a
trick
upon
you
she
shook
her
head
you
are
wrong
i
am
not
mistaken
i
am
with
child
and
the
child
is
yours
but
the
fault
is
no
more
yours
than
mine
i
wanted
you
before
you
looked
on
me
i
still
do
and
i
do
not
feel
at
fault
that
i
am
yours
that
my
child
is
yours
is
a
thing
of
wonder
and
joy
never
could
i
have
expected
so
much
kennon
looked
down
at
her
smudged
face
streaked
with
the
sudden
rivulets
of
tears
and
bitterness
galled
his
throat
dear
godlet
her
be
wrong
he
prayed
silently
let
it
be
pseudopregnancy
this
time
let
the
tests
be
negative
but
they
werent
unequivocally
they
confirmed
coppers
diagnosis
here
was
the
proof
he
needed
the
final
test
that
would
prove
the
lani
human
and
he
had
no
way
of
getting
it
where
it
would
do
any
good
it
would
take
at
least
four
months
of
steady
labor
before
the
ship
was
ready
and
he
didnt
have
that
sort
of
time
he
was
needed
here
and
his
prolonged
absence
would
cause
suspicion
and
investigation
something
would
have
to
be
donebut
what
he
couldnt
take
copper
off
the
island
in
an
airboat
they
were
checked
with
microscopic
care
by
otpen
ones
iff
a
jeep
didnt
have
enough
range
to
take
them
to
the
mainland
and
even
if
they
got
there
they
couldnt
get
off
the
planet
alexander
knew
everything
that
happened
on
kardons
two
spaceports
the
egg
was
the
only
way
but
the
egg
was
unfinished
and
unspaceworthy
frantically
kennon
considered
concealing
copper
he
shook
his
head
it
wouldnt
work
it
would
be
impossible
to
hide
a
baby
on
a
place
where
every
birth
was
recorded
nor
could
one
hide
evidence
of
pregnancy
in
a
lani
childbearing
leaves
telltale
marks
upon
the
body
and
copper
even
if
she
could
be
concealed
for
the
duration
of
her
pregnancy
could
never
survive
the
sharpeyed
scrutiny
of
her
fellows
or
the
other
humans
questions
would
inevitably
be
asked
there
had
to
be
a
solution
he
rubbed
his
forehead
wearily
it
was
strange
how
so
little
a
thing
as
the
union
of
a
spermatozoon
and
an
ovum
could
produce
so
much
trouble
he
looked
across
the
office
at
copper
placidly
filing
case
cards
she
wasnt
worrying
with
sublime
faith
she
was
sure
that
he
would
find
the
answer
the
one
that
would
solve
everything
he
shuddered
the
only
logical
solution
was
abortionand
that
was
unthinkable
he
would
not
murder
his
childnor
would
copper
permit
it
if
he
was
capable
of
doing
so
it
was
almost
a
relief
when
his
phone
rang
and
blaloks
voice
came
cheerfully
across
the
wire
tried
to
get
you
about
an
hour
ago
the
superintendent
said
but
your
girl
said
you
were
busy
i
was
you
through
now
yes
well
get
up
to
the
fortress
alexander
just
flew
in
and
hes
calling
a
meeting
something
important
has
come
up
something
important
a
wave
of
ice
rattled
down
kennons
spine
and
then
he
grinned
feebly
alexander
didnt
know
he
couldnt
know
it
had
to
be
something
else
ill
be
right
up
he
said
marveling
at
the
calmness
in
his
voice
kennon
couldnt
help
comparing
this
meeting
with
the
one
a
year
ago
the
location
was
differentthe
conference
room
in
alexandria
was
more
formal
than
blaloks
parlor
but
the
same
people
were
present
alexander
blalok
jordan
and
himself
somehow
alexander
seemed
to
have
shrunk
he
was
no
longer
as
impressive
as
he
had
been
but
the
man
still
radiated
force
even
though
it
didnt
seem
quite
so
overpowering
the
year
kennon
thought
had
done
much
to
build
his
selfconfidence
he
felt
assured
rather
than
nervous
good
to
see
you
kennon
alexander
said
reports
say
youre
doing
a
good
job
i
cant
claim
the
credit
kennon
said
eightyfive
per
cent
of
our
success
is
due
to
cooperation
from
the
operating
staff
and
thats
blaloks
doinghe
knocked
the
heads
of
the
division
managers
together
and
they
took
care
of
their
staffs
otherwise
we
could
have
had
a
bad
time
but
you
didnt
alexander
said
and
you
were
the
motive
force
ive
darn
near
motivated
myself
out
of
a
job
kennon
said
they
cooperate
all
too
well
nowadays
which
goes
to
prove
that
my
theories
on
preventive
medicine
are
right
alexander
said
turning
to
blalok
it
looks
that
way
blalok
admitted
but
that
could
be
because
you
picked
a
good
man
hes
good
in
more
ways
than
one
alexander
said
or
did
he
tell
you
he
saved
douglass
life
out
on
otpen
one
hes
never
said
a
word
alexander
smiled
another
point
in
his
favor
he
knows
how
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
not
when
hes
telling
someone
what
to
do
about
disease
jordon
interjected
or
telling
someone
off
when
they
havent
followed
directions
blaiok
added
better
and
better
i
was
sure
that
he
was
the
one
we
needed
when
we
first
met
kennon
felt
his
ears
turn
flaming
red
but
thats
not
the
reason
i
brought
you
here
this
isnt
a
jac
kennon
admiration
society
i
called
you
because
i
want
to
expand
the
lani
breeding
program
why
jordan
asked
blalok
stiffened
you
know
my
feeling
about
that
sir
ive
never
liked
the
idea
of
selling
them
if
thats
whats
in
your
mind
alexander
shook
his
head
simmer
down
he
said
as
he
seated
himself
at
the
head
of
the
table
theres
going
to
be
no
selling
the
lani
are
too
valuable
for
that
well
need
them
more
than
the
money
theyd
bring
on
the
market
you
seeive
acquired
a
planet
out
on
the
periphery
a
place
called
phoebe
one
of
our
ships
found
it
and
i
staked
a
discovery
claim
on
the
major
land
mass
and
the
crew
made
lesser
claims
that
covered
all
the
available
land
last
month
the
brotherhood
allowed
the
claims
last
week
the
crewmen
sold
me
their
land
phoebes
a
lovely
placequite
a
bit
like
floraand
the
ecological
tests
show
its
capable
of
supporting
mammalian
life
just
before
i
came
here
i
sent
three
shiploads
of
exterminators
to
clean
it
up
and
make
it
ready
for
us
it
should
be
ready
in
two
years
what
sort
of
an
ecology
are
you
exterminating
jordan
asked
not
that
it
makes
any
difference
alexander
said
but
its
mainly
reptilian
nothing
over
group
i
well
restock
with
floran
animals
jordan
sighed
since
thats
the
way
it
is
it
doesnt
make
any
difference
he
said
but
it
could
have
the
lani
are
sensitive
to
things
like
that
if
they
thought
that
they
were
walking
in
over
a
pile
of
bodies
theyd
do
badly
itd
be
like
olympus
all
over
again
and
we
couldnt
keep
them
from
knowing
we
talk
and
we
forget
but
theyd
tell
each
otherand
theyd
remember
i
know
alexander
said
somehow
theyve
never
forgotten
that
grandfather
trapped
the
last
of
the
lani
males
on
olympus
jordan
nodded
they
cant
stand
the
place
thats
why
we
had
to
abandon
the
station
does
this
new
world
have
a
moon
kennon
asked
abruptly
yesin
fact
it
has
two
habitable
notheyre
too
small
to
hold
air
but
men
could
live
there
in
domesbut
why
do
youoh
i
see
i
hadnt
considered
that
point
alexanders
hand
darted
to
the
phone
beside
him
get

he
snapped

alexander
dialed
the
scrambler
code
on
the
second
dial
at
the
base
of
the
phone
effectively
preventing
eavesdropping
by
beam
tappers
yes
he
went
on
its
project
phoebe
have
you
secured
title
to
the
moons
you
havent
wellyoud
better
do
it
before
some
of
our
competitors
get
bright
ideas
sure
they
know
about
the
projectdo
you
think
theyre
stupid
warren
over
at
consolidated
practically
told
me
that
he
was
onto
our
scheme
so
get
title
to
those
moons
since
theyre
uninhabitable
and
within
the
planets
primary
field
they
come
under
the
spatial
debris
act
and
you
should
be
able
to
get
kardonian
title
without
any
great
amount
of
trouble
naturally
we
want
themfor
defensewhat
else
well
have
most
of
our
eggs
in
that
basket
noi
dont
know
how
we
overlooked
that
point
but
if
it
wasnt
for
a
bright
young
man
out
here
wed
have
left
ourselves
wide
open
now
get
crackingget
that
leak
plugged
alexander
dropped
the
phone
back
in
its
cradle
and
sighed
wellthats
buttoned
up
he
said
thanks
kennon
kennon
looked
at
alexanders
grinning
face
his
own
impassive
but
a
shattering
certainty
exploded
in
his
mindalexander
was
a
telepath
that
was
his
difference
that
was
the
thing
that
made
him
feared
and
respected
by
his
business
associates
it
wouldnt
have
been
enough
on
the
central
worlds
where
men
knew
of
sensitives
and
took
precautions
against
them
but
out
here
on
the
periphery
it
was
a
deadly
advantage
so
i
gave
it
away
alexander
said
i
suppose
i
was
careless
but
your
thoughts
about
the
moons
shocked
me
you
practically
told
me
once
before
when
you
hired
me
kennon
said
but
i
never
realized
it
you
were
too
excited
then
i
wouldnt
know
kennon
said
at
any
rate
i
didnt
add
the
facts
correctly
from
somewhere
deep
in
his
memory
an
old
quip
came
floating
to
the
surface
an
executive
is
a
man
who
picks
brainsothers
brains
by
that
definition
alexander
was
an
executive
of
the
first
class
alexander
chuckled
suddenly
kennon
wanted
to
run
panic
flooded
him
what
had
he
been
thinking
about
had
he
thought
oftwo
times

whats

you
alexander
demanded
im
angry
kennon
said
i
told
you
the
conditions
id
sign
that
contract
and
you
wrote
a
peeper
clause
into
it
and
then
you
peep
in
the
worst
way
possible
theres
no
defense
against
a
telep
unless
you
know
about
him
youve
had
my
whole
mind
bare
youve
violated
my
personal
privacy
like
no
man
has
done
before
sure
im
mad
i
expected
honesty
from
youand
you
peep
the
anger
was
stronger
nowa
wave
of
raw
emotion
based
on
a
lifetime
of
training
in
mutual
respect
of
a
mans
privacya
feeling
intensified
by
his
childhood
environment
of
a
crowded
planetary
ecology
and
the
cramped
crew
quarters
on
a
spaceship
to
kennon
alexander
had
committed
the
ultimate
sin
i
can
see
i
made
a
mistake
by
not
telling
you
alexander
said
his
voice
was
cold
but
you
have
no
right
to
insult
me
im
not
saying
it
am
i
kennon
snapped
the
moonflower
on
the
bookcase
behind
alexander
was
a
thing
of
beauty
alexander
liked
beauty
he
had
said
so
and
the
great
hall
below
them
bore
it
out
it
was
a
lovely
room
those
four
bronze
lani
in
the
fountain
were
works
of
art
one
of
them
looked
remarkably
like
copper
copper
in
bronze
the
little
witch
had
probably
posed
for
the
casting
maybe
it
had
even
been
made
from
her
body
theyre
all
of
susy
alexander
said
i
can
see
why
you
are
angry
and
i
dont
blame
you
but
remember
i
warned
you
about
lani
copperkennon
wrenched
his
thoughts
back
to
the
moonflower
it
had
twelve
petals
limpid
white
on
the
borders
shading
to
deep
blue
in
the
centerfrom
which
the
creamcolored
stamen
surrounded
by
transparent
pistils
sprang
to
burst
into
a
golden
glory
of
pollen
that
dripped
in
tiny
yellow
flecks
to
the
broad
petals
below
it
was
a
magnificent
flower
there
was
nothing
like
it
on
beta
that
was
a
marvelous
thing
about
flowerswherever
one
went
in
the
universe
plants
used
the
same
methods
to
fertilize
their
seed
and
spread
their
germ
plasm
it
was
too
bad
thatkennon
jerked
his
attention
to
alexanders
face
he
detested
the
thought
that
his
mind
was
common
property
a
man
should
have
something
he
can
call
his
own
there
had
been
a
clinics
instructor
in
year
six
who
was
a
sensitive
the
classes
had
protected
themselves
against
his
prying
with
a
circleta
thought
screenhe
had
done
it
too
maybe
he
had
brought
the
circlet
with
him
if
he
did
no
one
was
going
to
catch
him
without
it
it
was
a
dirty
business
this
reading
of
others
thought
now
where
had
he
put
that
circlet
was
it
among
his
old
booksor
was
it
with
his
instruments
why
dont
you
go
back
to
your
house
and
find
it
alexander
snapped
as
you
are
youre
nothing
but
a
disruption
i
want
you
in
on
this
meeting
but
not
the
way
youre
acting
im
not
going
to
act
any
other
way
until
i
get
some
protection
from
peeping
kennon
said
grimly
and
if
you
think
this
is
bad
wait
till
i
start
going
through
comparative
anatomy
whats
the
matter
with
you
two
blalok
asked
be
quiet
alexander
snapped
this
isnt
your
problem
kennon
is
behaving
like
a
spoiled
child
hes
a
telepath
kennon
said
and
he
didnt
tell
me
so
what
ive
known
that
for
years
and
you
stand
for
it
im
a
mystic
not
a
betan
blalok
said
i
dont
have
your
insane
desire
for
privacy
go
find
that
thought
screen
if
you
still
have
it
alexander
said
i
dont
want
any
more
of
this
youre
making
me
ill
kennon
grinned
thinly
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
it
was
a
good
thing
he
remembered
alexander
was
squeamish
and
didnt
like
anatomy
the
door
was
to
his
left
an
iris
door
with
eight
leavesterribly
oldfashioned
about
ten
steps
away
count
themonetwothree
alexander
sighed
as
kennon
left
the
room
i
certainly
pushed
the
panic
button
on
that
young
man
he
said
he
has
a
pathological
attitude
toward
telepathy
wonder
what
he
has
to
hide
that
he
wants
privacy
so
badly
even
for
a
betan
this
reaction
was
violent
oh
i
dont
know
hes
a
pretty
emotional
sort
maybe
he
hates
to
look
like
a
fool
hes
gotten
himself
mixed
up
with
one
of
the
lani
cute
little
thing
by
the
name
of
copper
blalok
said
ohthats
it
i
thought
that
was
what
he
was
hiding
a
picture
of
a
girl
kept
popping
up
alexander
chuckled
i
suppose
thats
the
trouble
a
man
hardly
likes
to
look
a
fool
particularly
to
someone
who
has
warned
him
at
that
i
dont
blame
him
they
are
beautiful
and
affectionate
and
even
with
their
superstitions
and
tabus
theyre
better
than
most
humans
for
pets
blalok
said
heavily
theyre
not
better
at
anything
jordan
demurred
they
cant
beman
is
the
best
and
always
will
be
the
eternal
racial
chauvinist
alexander
murmured
he
turned
his
attention
to
blalok
but
for
awhile
evald
id
suggest
you
keep
an
eye
on
our
young
man
i
still
dont
like
his
reaction
it
was
too
violenttoo
defensive
i
dont
feel
right
about
it
perhaps
betans
are
more
sensitive
than
most
people
but
it
seems
to
me
that
hes
trying
to
conceal
something
there
was
an
undertone
of
fearand
something
elsebeneath
his
defenses
couldnt
you
get
any
more
than
that
blalok
asked
youre
pretty
good
at
this
mindreading
business
his
defenses
were
remarkably
good
alexander
said
dryly
well
hed
done
it
now
kennon
thought
he
found
the
thoughtscreen
circlet
sandwiched
between
two
books
on
comparative
neuroanatomy
which
he
hadnt
bothered
to
unpack
he
slipped
it
on
and
connected
the
lead
wires
to
a
portable
battery
pack
there
was
a
halfforgotten
tingling
as
the
weak
field
heterodyned
his
thought
waves
kennon
sighed
if
alexander
wasnt
suspicious
of
him
now
the
man
was
a
fool
hed
done
as
well
as
he
could
with
confusion
and
outrage
but
it
was
hardly
possible
to
hide
behind
superficialities
even
the
most
disciplined
mind
couldnt
do
that
without
some
preparation
undoubtedly
his
concern
about
copper
had
leaked
through
he
could
only
hope
that
other
and
more
important
things
had
not
wellhe
could
go
back
to
the
conference
now
but
he
would
have
to
be
doubly
careful
from
now
on
he
couldnt
make
daily
trips
to
olympus
his
reaction
had
killed
that
plan
alexander
would
be
suspicious
nowand
unusual
actions
would
crystallize
suspicion
to
certainty
now
he
needed
a
reason
to
be
in
that
area
and
then
he
grinned
he
had
a
reasona
good
oneone
that
would
fit
in
with
alexanders
plans
and
his
own
the
only
problem
would
be
to
make
alexander
buy
itand
that
might
be
difficult
hed
have
to
work
carefullybut
with
normal
luck
he
could
put
the
idea
across
he
crossed
his
fingers
as
he
trudged
back
up
the
path
to
alexandria
the
conference
dragged
on
unlike
most
meetings
this
one
accomplished
thingswhich
was
a
tribute
to
alexanders
ability
to
keep
the
subject
in
hand
details
of
the
expansion
program
presented
by
alexander
were
rapidly
reduced
to
workable
plans
they
involved
some
rearrangement
of
existing
facilities
and
the
construction
of
others
but
the
obvious
snags
were
rapidly
disposed
of
and
the
whole
revamped
operation
was
outlined
on
paper
in
surprisingly
few
hours
a
deadline
date
was
set
construction
was
authorized
and
in
the
morning
the
first
steps
in
the
practical
implementation
of
the
new
program
would
be
taken
well
thats
that
alexander
said
with
a
sigh
i
think
this
calls
for
a
drink
theres
one
more
thing
kennon
said
i
know
it
isnt
much
but
jordans
remark
started
me
thinking
what
remark
jordan
asked
the
one
you
made
at
the
beginning
about
phoebe
possibly
being
like
the
olympus
station
ive
often
wondered
why
that
particular
location
has
been
so
difficult
to
operate
sure
i
know
the
accepted
explanation
but
i
think
we
should
learn
why
it
works
and
how
to
break
a
tabu
if
we
dont
we
might
be
in
for
trouble
thats
a
good
thought
alexander
said
i
tried
to
find
out
once
but
all
i
could
discover
was
that
it
was
tabu
the
lani
simply
didnt
like
it
and
despite
the
fact
that
i
can
read
minds
i
didnt
learn
any
more
than
that
theres
a
certain
sexlinkage
to
telepathy
as
you
probably
know
kennon
nodded
all
i
could
discover
was
that
their
dislike
of
olympus
was
a
basic
emotion
rather
than
reasoned
thought
they
were
nervous
irritable
disobedient
and
uncooperative
while
they
were
thereand
even
they
didnt
know
why
it
was
merely
tabu
we
even
tried
youngstersbut
the
attitude
was
the
same
id
like
to
know
more
about
that
basic
emotion
we
should
understand
it
kennon
agreed
if
we
transship
a
large
number
of
lani
to
a
strange
world
we
should
know
their
deepest
motivations
we
cannot
take
the
chance
that
the
transplant
wont
take
with
all
the
money
youre
sinking
into
this
project
you
have
a
point
there
have
you
any
suggestions
about
how
to
accomplish
this
alexanders
voice
was
interested
i
have
hire
a
psychologist
and
reopen
olympus
itll
be
the
same
story
jordan
said
not
if
you
apply
experimental
procedure
kennon
said
divide
the
place
into
a
number
of
separate
units
in
which
groups
ofsay
tenlani
of
various
ages
are
kept
let
every
group
know
where
they
are
but
dont
let
them
come
in
contact
with
one
another
observe
them
constantly
put
spy
cells
in
the
units
couple
them
to
recorders
prepare
a
set
of
test
situations
and
observe
how
each
group
performs
question
individuals
under
narcosynthesis
observe
and
record
any
changes
in
physical
conditiongive
them
the
works
maybe
we
can
collect
some
basic
data
that
will
indicate
the
answer
not
a
bad
idea
alexander
said
i
dont
like
it
jordan
said
it
sounds
cumbersome
it
is
kennon
agreed
but
it
may
save
a
great
deal
of
trouble
later
i
think
youre
right
kennon
blalok
said
we
should
know
everything
we
can
what
would
you
do
first
if
you
were
heading
this
program
alexander
asked
he
eyed
kennon
critically
nothing
kennon
said
promptly
im
not
qualified
to
run
an
investigation
like
this
you
need
a
specialist
i
am
a
practitioner
hmmbut
you
know
experimental
procedure
naturallybut
i
do
not
have
the
training
to
prepare
a
program
or
evaluate
its
results
the
only
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
check
the
physical
condition
of
the
experimental
groups
could
you
set
up
the
physical
facilities
alexander
asked
possiblyid
need
a
set
of
plans
of
the
station
and
i
couldnt
guarantee
that
the
specialist
wouldnt
want
to
make
changes
but
the
physical
arrangements
should
be
simple
enough
to
construct
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
prepare
a
plan
i
could
have
it
by
tomorrow
or
perhaps
a
day
later
if
you
can
do
it
by
then
ill
stay
over
id
like
to
examine
this
proposal
more
closely
it
has
merit
thats
the
second
constructive
suggestion
youve
made
tonight
despite
your
peculiar
desire
for
privacy
im
glad
you
came
back
alexander
smiled
kennon
smiled
back
apparently
the
entrepreneur
had
taken
the
bait
but
it
was
too
early
to
tell
whether
he
had
swallowed
it
without
reservation
it
all
depended
upon
how
much
had
been
given
away
before
he
had
discovered
that
alexander
was
a
telepath
perhaps
alexander
was
merely
leading
him
on
there
were
too
many
intangibles
and
there
was
no
way
of
predicting
how
it
would
turn
out
but
he
felt
mildly
optimistic
alexander
closed
the
meeting
and
kennon
left
promptly
he
had
a
good
excuse
there
was
plenty
of
work
to
do
if
he
was
going
to
prepare
an
adequate
plan
for
utilizing
olympus
station
jordan
went
with
him
but
blalok
stayed
behind
it
was
natural
enough
blalok
was
the
administrator
but
kennon
felt
uneasy
nor
would
he
have
felt
any
better
if
he
could
have
heard
what
went
on
after
he
left
alexander
looked
quizzically
at
blalok
after
the
door
closed
behind
the
two
men
well
evald
what
do
you
think
does
it
strike
you
that
kennons
sincereor
does
it
sound
as
though
he
has
something
up
his
sleeve
if
he
does
blalok
said
i
dont
know
what
it
could
be
i
wouldnt
take
a
job
on
olympus
if
you
gave
it
to
me
if
he
doesnt
know
about
the
place
alexander
said
thoughtfully
its
probable
that
his
suggestion
was
honest
i
think
it
is
but
im
not
sure
he
worries
me
now
that
i
cant
read
him
i
think
ill
send
douglas
back
here
to
watch
him
why
in
my
book
thatd
be
a
poor
choice
after
all
you
said
kennon
saved
his
life
he
should
be
grateful
you
dont
know
douglas
alexander
said
he
hates
kennons
guts
for
what
he
did
what
did
he
do
he
made
douglas
feel
inferior
and
theres
no
surer
way
to
gain
my
cousins
undying
enmity
alexander
laughed
i
know
he
said
hed
like
to
kill
me
too
blalok
shrugged
but
in
the
meantime
i
want
you
to
keep
an
eye
on
kennon
if
his
outline
is
all
right
im
going
to
authorize
him
to
set
up
this
experiment
i
want
to
give
him
every
possible
chance
i
like
himand
hes
done
good
work
i
wouldnt
want
him
to
feel
that
i
distrust
him
which
you
do
of
course
blalok
said
dryly
alexander
smiled
actually
he
said
with
equal
dryness
i
distrust
everyone
chapter
xvi
if
you
think
this
job
is
easy
you
have
another
think
coming
kennon
said
bitterly
i
hired
out
as
a
veterinarian
not
as
a
nursemaid
for
a
bunch
of
psychoneurotic
humans
and
superstitious
lani
the
place
is
jinxed
they
tell
meha
jinxed
sure
its
jinxed
what
job
wouldnt
be
with
a
bunch
of
goofballs
like
these
ive
got
working
on
it
i
cant
keep
a
lani
here
for
two
weeks
without
having
her
throw
a
catfit
and
the
superstitious
idiots
are
affecting
the
menwho
ought
to
know
better
i
wish
id
never
have
opened
my
big
mouth
to
alexander
as
far
as
im
concerned
he
can
take
this
job
and
heytake
it
easy
man
blalok
said
youre
heading
straight
for
a
nervous
breakdown
and
why
shouldnt
i
kennon
asked
nothing
goes
right
theres
always
trouble
i
order
materialsthey
dont
arrive
theres
worker
trouble
equipment
trouble
installation
trouble
everybodys
cutting
corners
trying
to
get
done
faster
and
away
soonerand
all
they
do
is
mess
up
work
that
should
have
been
done
right
the
first
time
we
should
have
been
finished
last
week
but
we
have
another
week
to
go
at
least
unless
some
bumblefingered
beanbrain
gets
another
bright
idea
that
sets
us
back
again
im
sick
to
death
of
it
i
know
i
know
blalok
said
soothingly
and
im
sorry
sorry
what
good
is
that
you
and
jordan
come
up
here
in
relays
just
what
do
you
think
youll
find
or
has
alexander
dragged
you
into
keeping
an
eye
on
me
because
i
dont
like
someone
snooping
inside
my
skull
its
not
that
blalok
said
its
just
oh
dont
make
excuses
you
know
and
i
know
the
bossman
is
suspicious
kennon
shrugged
normally
i
wouldnt
blame
him
but
its
a
damned
nuisance
with
things
the
way
they
are
all
we
have
is
one
more
bay
and
a
hall
to
finishbut
if
now
wait
a
minute
blalok
said
get
the
kink
out
of
your
neck
and
simmer
down
surethe
bossman
told
us
to
keep
an
eye
on
youbut
thats
not
why
im
here
this
time
well
douglas
came
back
this
morning
what
for
i
dont
know
blaloks
face
wore
the
noncommittal
look
it
always
wore
when
he
was
taking
liberties
with
the
truth
youre
probably
the
worst
liar
in
the
galaxy
kennon
chuckled
hes
here
to
breathe
down
my
neck
isnt
he
blalok
nodded
keep
him
off
my
back
for
another
week
and
he
can
breathe
all
he
wants
to
ill
be
done
then
i
cant
promise
a
thing
kennon
shrugged
its
too
much
to
ask
i
guess
but
i
can
try
blalok
added
thats
enough
for
me
kennon
grinned
has
he
turned
alexandria
into
a
shambles
yet
not
yet
but
everyones
uneasy
i
cant
blame
them
that
young
fellows
undiluted
poison
by
the
way
how
does
he
look
about
the
same
the
medics
must
have
done
a
good
job
kennon
said
the
bossman
shipped
him
to
beta
for
treatment
blalok
said
he
didnt
trust
the
docs
out
here
that
figures
at
any
rate
douglas
couldnt
have
gone
to
a
better
place
what
happened
to
him
he
stuck
his
nose
where
he
shouldnt
kennon
said
pointedly
blalok
stiffened
im
sorry
evald
even
if
you
knew
i
couldnt
talk
about
it
what
i
know
about
douglas
is
classified
welldouglas
is
doing
plenty
of
talking
claims
his
stay
in
the
hospital
was
all
your
fault
kennon
shrugged
thats
his
opinion
and
as
long
as
he
stays
out
of
my
way
hes
welcome
to
it
blalok
looked
at
kennons
haggard
face
with
mild
concern
doc
he
said
youd
better
take
it
easy
youre
going
to
pieces
ill
be
through
here
in
another
week
ill
have
this
all
wrapped
up
providing
youre
not
wrapped
up
first
eh
in
a
shroud
you
look
like
a
walking
corpse
kennon
chuckled
wearily
sometimes
i
feel
like
one
but
id
like
to
get
this
job
finished
well
ill
do
what
i
can
blalok
said
ill
try
to
keep
him
down
at
alexandria
for
a
few
days
itll
be
enough
kennon
said
more
than
enoughhe
added
mentally
the
coils
of
fuel
wire
were
ready
to
load
and
the
power
slugs
for
the
ships
reactor
were
already
stored
in
the
power
plant
building
here
at
olympus
three
more
days
and
the
old
spacer
would
be
as
ready
to
fly
as
she
would
ever
be
and
after
that
it
was
in
the
lap
of
fate
he
ushered
blalok
to
his
jeep
and
watched
until
he
disappeared
im
getting
to
be
a
firstclass
liar
he
remarked
wryly
to
himself
as
he
turned
back
to
the
temporary
quarters
he
was
occupying
at
the
station
and
the
bad
thing
about
it
is
that
im
actually
enjoying
it
a
few
weeks
ago
an
admission
like
that
would
have
been
inconceivable
it
was
odd
he
thought
how
one
thing
led
to
another
and
produced
an
end
that
could
not
be
foreseen
now
he
could
lie
and
dissemble
with
the
best
he
had
no
compunction
about
falsifying
a
requisition
or
stealing
what
he
could
not
obtain
with
apparent
honesty
his
character
had
sunk
to
an
alltime
low
he
reflected
with
grim
humor
as
he
walked
into
the
shadow
of
the
main
building
neither
blaloks
nor
jordans
frequent
visits
bothered
him
both
men
were
creatures
of
habit
and
both
were
married
they
stayed
home
at
nightand
it
was
nighttime
that
he
worked
on
the
spacer
the
project
afforded
him
a
perfect
cover
and
it
was
only
minutes
by
jeep
away
from
the
crater
even
so
the
double
duty
was
an
appalling
task
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
if
it
wasnt
for
copper
her
quick
fingers
keen
eyesight
and
uncanny
memory
made
the
work
seem
simple
and
neither
the
tediousness
of
repairing
miles
of
circuitry
nor
the
depressing
environment
of
olympus
station
seemed
to
bother
her
while
he
worked
with
the
men
on
the
project
she
restored
and
reassembled
circuits
in
his
quarters
and
at
night
they
replaced
them
in
the
old
ship
and
the
godegg
was
rapidly
becoming
operational
kennon
wondered
what
it
was
about
copper
that
made
her
so
different
from
the
rest
olympus
didnt
bother
her
at
all
in
fact
she
seemed
to
thrive
on
the
depressing
atmosphere
that
filled
the
station
perhaps
it
was
because
she
had
violated
the
tabu
about
the
godegg
so
often
that
ordinary
superstition
had
no
effect
upon
her
he
shrugged
he
had
troubles
enough
without
worrying
about
coppers
motivations
and
not
the
least
of
these
was
taking
the
godegg
into
space
kennon
looked
forward
to
blastoff
with
distinct
misgivings
there
was
too
much
about
the
ancient
spacer
that
was
strangeand
too
much
that
was
terrifying
basically
the
ship
was
an
ionjet
job
with
atomic
primaries
and
a
spindizzy
converter
that
might
possibly
take
her
up
as
high
as
middle
yellow
cthfar
enough
to
give
her
a
good
turn
of
speed
but
not
enough
to
compensate
for
timelag
her
screens
were
monstrosities
double
polyphase
lattices
that
looked
about
as
spacetight
as
so
many
sieves
there
were
no
acceleration
dampers
no
temporal
compensators
no
autopilot
no
fourspace
computer
and
the
primaries
operated
on
nuclear
rather
than
binding
energy
the
control
chairs
werent
equipped
with
forcefields
but
instead
had
incredibly
primitive
safety
webs
that
held
one
in
place
by
sheer
tensile
strength
taking
a
ship
like
that
into
space
was
an
open
invitation
to
suicide
a
man
needed
a
combination
of
foolhardy
bravery
and
incredible
fatalism
to
blast
off
in
a
can
like
this
he
had
the
stimulus
but
the
knowledge
of
what
he
would
face
troubled
him
more
than
he
cared
to
admit
more
and
more
as
he
understood
the
ship
he
was
amazed
at
the
courage
of
the
ancients
who
had
blithely
leaped
into
hyperspace
in
these
flying
coffins
with
no
more
motivation
than
to
see
what
was
beyond
the
nearest
star
and
in
ships
more
primitive
than
this
men
had
swept
through
the
star
systems
nearest
earth
in
the
outward
expansion
of
the
first
millennium
he
sighed
the
breed
of
man
must
have
been
tough
in
the
old
daysand
hed
soon
be
finding
out
if
any
of
that
ancient
toughness
remained
he
opened
the
door
to
his
quarters
copper
was
sitting
in
his
favorite
chair
a
pile
of
completed
assemblies
neatly
stacked
beside
her
and
a
disorderly
file
of
crumpled
cloth
at
her
feet
her
face
was
sullen
as
she
looked
up
at
him
ive
had
about
all
of
this
im
going
to
take
she
said
mutinously
as
she
stirred
the
heap
of
cloth
with
a
bare
foot
not
even
you
are
going
to
make
me
wear
thosethings
kennon
sighed
it
was
the
same
old
story
for
months
he
had
been
trying
patiently
to
indoctrinate
copper
with
a
minimum
of
civilized
habits
but
she
was
quite
literally
a
savage
in
her
entire
lifetime
she
had
never
worn
clothing
and
to
encase
her
body
in
hose
kilts
blouse
and
sandals
was
a
form
of
torture
she
scratched
wiggled
and
twisted
at
the
garments
until
she
looked
as
bad
as
she
felt
and
would
usually
finish
a
session
by
tearing
off
the
offending
clothes
and
sulking
she
was
doing
it
now
you
must
act
like
a
civilized
human
being
kennon
said
mildly
youre
simply
going
to
have
to
learn
to
wear
these
clothes
properly
why
im
more
comfortable
as
i
am
thats
not
the
point
you
are
going
to
be
living
in
human
society
and
you
must
act
human
the
only
planet
where
you
could
get
away
with
nudity
is
santos
and
were
not
going
there
why
not
ive
explained
it
time
and
again
well
have
to
go
to
beta
thats
the
only
place
i
know
where
youll
have
a
fair
hearing
and
on
beta
people
wear
clothes
they
have
to
its
cold
even
in
summer
and
in
the
wintertime
theres
snow
whats
snow
ice
crystals
that
fall
like
rain
but
ive
told
you
this
before
and
i
still
dont
believe
it
believe
it
or
not
youre
going
to
wear
those
things
now
put
them
on
she
looked
at
him
with
mutiny
on
her
face
all
right
slave
driver
she
muttered
as
she
picked
up
the
clothing
but
i
hope
youll
itch
someday
and
be
unable
to
scratch
and
try
to
wear
those
garments
more
gracefully
you
make
them
look
like
a
sack
they
feel
like
one
i
keep
thinking
that
all
i
need
is
a
tag
around
my
neck
you
havent
much
time
to
get
used
to
them
kennon
said
were
leaving
this
week
so
soon
yesand
youll
wear
those
things
to
the
ship
into
the
ship
and
all
the
time
were
on
the
ship
youll
keep
wearing
clothing
until
it
looks
right
slave
driver
copper
hissed
slave
kennon
answered
equably
copper
giggled
the
sound
was
utterly
unexpected
and
completely
incongruous
that
was
the
wonder
of
her
kennon
reflected
her
mercurial
temperament
made
life
something
that
was
continually
exciting
she
was
a
neverending
delight
chapter
xvii
it
was
the
last
trip
kennon
loaded
the
jeep
with
the
lastminute
items
he
would
need
the
four
reactor
cores
in
their
lead
cases
went
aboard
last
and
were
packed
inside
a
pile
of
leadblock
shielding
he
helped
copper
in
and
looked
back
without
regret
as
the
bulk
of
olympus
station
vanished
below
him
in
the
dusk
the
last
of
the
work
crew
had
left
that
afternoon
the
station
was
ready
for
occupancy
his
assignment
had
been
completed
he
felt
an
odd
pleasure
at
having
finished
the
job
alexander
might
not
be
happy
about
his
subsequent
actions
but
he
could
have
no
complaint
about
what
he
did
while
he
was
here
wellsay
goodbye
to
flora
he
said
to
copper
i
dont
want
to
she
said
i
dont
want
to
leave
you
cant
stay
you
know
that
she
nodded
but
that
doesnt
make
me
any
less
regretful
regretful
all
rightscared
were
going
to
try
to
make
the
godegg
fly
again
not
only
is
it
sacrilege
but
as
youve
often
said
its
dangerous
i
have
no
desire
to
die
you
have
two
courses
i
knowyouve
pointed
them
out
often
enough
copper
said
and
since
you
decided
to
go
id
go
with
you
even
though
i
knew
the
egg
would
blow
up
youre
quite
a
girl
kennon
said
admiringly
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
i
love
you
not
nearly
often
enough
copper
said
you
could
do
it
every
day
and
id
never
get
tired
of
hearing
it
the
jeep
settled
over
the
lava
wall
well
leave
it
in
the
passageway
when
were
through
kennon
said
maybe
it
will
survive
blastoff
why
worry
about
it
copper
asked
i
hate
destroying
anything
needlessly
kennon
said
and
since
we
have
plenty
of
time
we
might
as
well
be
neat
about
our
departure
he
was
wrong
of
course
but
he
didnt
know
that
douglas
alexander
checked
the
radarscope
and
whistled
in
surprise
at
the
picture
it
revealed
so
thats
where
hes
going
he
said
softly
to
himself
cousin
alex
was
right
as
usual
he
grimaced
unpleasantly
hes
up
to
somethingthats
for
sure
his
face
twisted
into
an
expression
that
was
half
sneer
half
triumph
this
is
going
to
be
fun
he
moved
the
control
and
his
airboat
hovering
silently
at
five
thousand
meters
dropped
toward
the
ground
in
free
fall
as
douglas
loosened
the
burkholtz
in
the
holster
at
his
waist
but
what
is
he
doing
he
muttered
the
question
hung
unanswered
in
the
still
air
of
the
cabin
as
the
airboat
dropped
downward
douglas
hadnt
been
impressed
with
blaloks
attempt
at
a
delaying
action
normally
he
might
have
been
but
his
fear
of
his
cousin
was
greater
than
his
respect
for
blalok
the
superintendent
had
only
succeeded
in
accomplishing
something
he
had
not
intended
when
he
had
tried
to
dissuade
douglas
from
visiting
kennon
he
had
made
douglas
cautious
the
airboat
and
longrange
surveillance
had
been
the
result
for
the
past
two
nights
douglas
had
hung
over
olympus
station
checking
the
placeto
leave
at
dawn
when
the
new
days
work
began
for
two
nights
kennon
had
been
lucky
he
had
departed
for
the
egg
shortly
before
douglas
took
up
his
station
and
had
returned
after
the
watcher
had
called
it
a
night
and
had
returned
home
but
this
last
night
kennon
left
lateand
his
departure
was
noted
wonder
whos
the
girl
with
him
douglas
said
as
the
boat
plunged
down
well
ill
be
finding
out
in
a
minute
kennons
head
jerked
upward
at
the
sound
of
air
whistling
past
the
airboats
hull
and
a
wave
of
icy
coldness
swept
through
his
chest
there
was
no
question
that
he
was
discovered
his
shoulders
sagged
wellit
was
a
good
try
he
said
bitterly
as
copper
looked
at
him
with
sudden
terror
on
her
face
i
dont
want
to
die
she
wailed
you
wontnot
if
i
can
help
it
kennon
said
move
away
from
mequickly
but
do
as
i
say
kennons
voice
was
sharp
and
keep
that
hood
over
your
face
the
airboat
settled
softly
on
the
ash
in
front
of
him
the
door
snapped
open
and
douglas
dropped
to
the
ground
burkholtz
jutting
from
his
pudgy
fist
my
my
douglas
said
what
have
we
here
dr
kennon
and
a
woman
i
thought
better
of
you
than
that
doctor
and
all
dressed
up
in
antiradiation
suits
this
is
interesting
just
what
are
you
doing
up
here
on
the
mountain
so
late
at
nightprospecting
you
might
call
it
that
kennon
said
his
body
sagged
with
relief
douglas
thank
ochsner
it
was
douglas
he
was
running
true
to
formtalking
when
he
should
have
been
shooting
douglas
jerked
his
head
toward
copper
standing
a
few
feet
to
his
left
who
is
she
none
of
your
business
kennon
snapped
hoping
that
his
outburst
covered
coppers
gasp
of
surprise
and
fear
and
knowing
that
it
didnt
im
making
it
my
business
theres
something
funny
going
on
around
here
kennon
blinked
could
it
be
that
douglas
didnt
know
had
he
been
watching
them
on
radar
durilium
was
radartransparent
it
absorbed
and
dissipated
electromagnetic
waves
rather
than
reflecting
them
for
a
second
he
felt
a
tiny
surge
of
hope
stand
where
you
are
douglas
said
as
he
stepped
over
to
the
halfparalyzed
copper
and
jerked
the
hood
back
from
her
face
for
a
moment
he
looked
puzzled
just
who
are
you
he
demanded
i
dont
recall
seeing
you
before
and
then
recognition
dawned
old
docs
lani
he
gasped
she
works
for
me
now
kennon
said
douglas
laughed
it
wasnt
a
nice
sound
all
dressed
up
he
asked
nice
work
thats
my
fault
kennon
said
you
know
the
rules
douglas
said
i
could
blast
you
both
go
ahead
kennon
said
but
if
you
do
youll
never
find
out
what
were
doing
up
here
douglas
hesitated
kennons
voice
was
flat
and
filled
with
utter
conviction
theres
a
reason
why
coppers
wearing
that
suit
kennon
continued
and
you
wont
know
that
either
the
burkholtz
swiveled
around
to
point
at
kennons
belly
ive
had
about
enough
of
this
lets
have
it
tell
me
what
youre
doing
here
ill
do
better
than
that
kennon
said
promptly
ill
show
you
youll
be
surprised
at
what
weve
uncovered
he
made
his
muscles
relax
and
forced
himself
to
speak
naturally
copper
he
noted
was
still
rigid
with
terror
the
alexandersany
of
themwere
everything
he
had
said
they
were
they
were
the
masters
here
and
despite
coppers
boast
she
was
as
susceptible
to
their
influence
as
any
other
lani
all
right
douglas
said
show
me
this
thing
id
never
be
able
to
find
without
your
help
he
half
turned
to
copper
stay
where
you
are
lani
he
said
dont
move
until
i
come
back
yes
man
douglas
copper
replied
her
voice
was
flat
colorless
and
submissive
kennon
shuddered
he
had
never
heard
precisely
that
tone
from
her
before
one
word
from
douglas
and
she
had
become
a
zombiea
mindless
muscle
preparation
that
existed
only
to
obey
anger
filled
himanger
that
one
he
loved
could
be
ordered
by
someone
who
wasnt
worth
a
third
of
heranger
that
she
obeyedanger
at
his
own
impotence
and
frustration
it
wasnt
a
clean
anger
it
was
a
dark
redsplashed
thing
that
struggled
and
writhed
inside
him
a
fierce
unreasoning
rage
that
seethed
and
bubbled
yet
could
not
break
free
for
an
instant
with
blinding
clarity
kennon
understood
the
feelings
of
the
caged
male
lani
on
otpen
one
and
he
sympathized
follow
me
he
said
and
started
around
the
ship
staynogo
ahead
douglas
said
but
remember
im
right
behind
you
kennon
walked
straight
up
to
the
pit
and
pointed
down
at
the
dark
bulk
of
the
egg
concealed
in
the
shadows
of
the
bottom
thats
it
he
said
what
i
dont
see
anything
douglas
said
suspiciously
hereill
shine
a
light
kennon
reached
for
his
belt
no
you
dont
i
know
that
trick
youre
not
going
to
blind
me
take
that
torch
loose
carefullythats
itnow
hand
it
to
me
douglas
hand
closed
over
the
smooth
plastic
cautiously
he
turned
on
the
beam
and
directed
it
downward
a
spacer
he
gasped
how
did
that
get
here
he
leaned
forward
to
look
into
the
pit
as
a
dark
shadow
materialized
behind
him
kennon
choked
back
the
involuntary
cry
of
warning
that
rose
in
his
throat
copper
his
muscles
tensed
as
her
arm
came
up
and
downa
shadow
almost
invisible
in
the
starlight
the
leaning
figure
of
douglas
collapsed
like
a
puppet
whose
strings
had
been
suddenly
released
the
torch
dropped
from
his
hand
and
went
bouncing
and
winking
down
the
wall
of
the
pit
followed
by
douglasa
limp
bundle
of
arms
and
legs
that
rotated
grotesquely
as
he
disappeared
down
the
slope
starlight
gleamed
on
the
burkholtz
lying
on
the
lip
of
the
crater
where
it
had
fallen
from
his
hand
i
told
you
that
not
even
man
alexander
could
order
me
since
i
gave
my
love
to
you
copper
said
smugly
as
she
peered
over
the
edge
of
the
pit
a
chunk
of
lava
gripped
in
one
small
capable
hand
maybe
this
proves
it
douglas
isnt
alexander
kennon
said
slowly
as
he
picked
up
the
blaster
but
i
believe
you
didnt
i
act
convincingly
she
said
brightly
very
he
said
you
fooled
me
completely
the
important
thing
was
that
i
fooled
douglas
you
did
that
all
right
now
lets
get
him
out
of
that
pit
why
the
jet
blast
will
fry
him
when
we
take
off
what
difference
would
that
make
i
told
you
kennon
said
that
i
never
destroy
things
unnecessarilynot
even
things
like
douglas
but
he
would
have
destroyed
you
thats
no
excuse
for
murder
now
go
back
to
the
jeep
and
fetch
a
rope
ill
go
down
and
get
him
out
do
we
have
to
bother
with
him
copper
asked
and
then
shrugged
it
was
an
eloquent
gesture
expressing
disgust
resignation
and
unwilling
compliance
in
one
lift
of
smoothly
muscled
shoulders
theres
no
question
about
it
kennon
said
youre
becoming
more
human
every
day
he
chuckled
as
he
slid
over
the
edge
of
the
pit
following
the
path
douglas
had
taken
a
moment
before
he
found
him
sitting
on
a
pile
of
ashes
shaking
his
head
what
happened
douglas
asked
querulously
there
was
fear
in
his
voice
copper
hit
you
on
the
head
with
a
rock
kennon
said
as
he
bent
over
and
retrieved
the
torch
still
burning
near
douglas
feet
the
lani
douglas
voice
was
incredulous
not
a
lani
kennon
corrected
shes
as
human
as
you
or
i
thats
a
lie
douglas
said
maybe
this
spacers
a
lie
too
her
ancestors
came
in
ita
pair
of
humans
named
alfred
and
melissa
weygand
they
were
christian
missionaries
from
a
planet
called
heaven
out
in
ophiuchus
sector
went
out
to
convert
aliens
and
landed
here
when
their
fuel
ran
out
kennon
paused
that
was
about
four
millennia
ago
their
descendants
naturally
reverted
to
barbarism
in
a
few
generations
but
theres
enough
evidence
in
the
ship
to
prove
that
the
lani
were
their
children
but
the
tailsthe
differencesthe
failure
of
the
test
douglas
said
mutation
kennon
replied
those
old
spindizzy
converters
werent
too
choosy
about
how
they
scattered
radiation
and
they
had
come
a
long
way
he
paused
looking
down
at
douglas
feeling
a
twinge
of
pity
for
the
man
his
world
was
crumbling
and
there
was
no
other
human
blood
available
to
filter
out
their
peculiarities
it
might
have
been
done
during
the
first
couple
of
generations
but
constant
inbreeding
fixed
the
genetic
pattern
how
did
you
discover
this
douglas
asked
accident
kennon
said
briefly
youll
never
be
able
to
prove
theyre
human
douglas
said
the
ships
log
will
do
that
not
without
a
humanity
testthey
cant
pass
that
sorry
to
disappoint
you
your
grandfather
used
the
wrong
sort
of
sperm
now
if
there
had
been
a
betan
in
the
crew
you
mean
shes
pregnant
kennon
nodded
theres
been
mutation
on
beta
he
said
and
its
apparently
a
similar
one
to
hers
betanlani
matings
are
fertile
douglass
shoulders
sagged
and
then
straightened
i
dont
believe
it
he
said
youre
just
a
damned
sneaking
spy
somehow
or
other
you
got
a
spacer
in
here
after
you
wormed
your
way
into
cousin
alexs
confidenceand
now
youre
going
to
space
out
with
the
nucleus
of
a
new
farm
just
wait
when
alex
learns
of
this
the
galaxyll
be
too
small
to
hold
you
dont
babble
like
a
fool
kennon
said
with
disgust
how
could
i
land
a
spacer
here
without
being
spotted
you
sound
like
a
twocredit
novel
and
even
if
i
didwould
it
be
a
can
like
this
kennon
played
the
torch
over
the
blueblack
durilium
protruding
from
the
ashes
douglas
eyes
widened
as
he
took
in
the
details
of
construction
what
an
antique
he
blurted
where
did
you
get
this
can
i
found
it
here
tell
me
another
one
you
wont
believe
kennon
said
flatly
because
you
dont
dare
believe
you
have
a
mental
block
youve
killed
maimed
tortured
treated
them
like
animalsand
now
your
mind
shrinks
from
admitting
theyre
human
you
know
what
will
happen
if
the
old
court
decision
is
reversed
it
will
wreck
your
little
empire
dry
up
your
money
break
youand
you
cant
stand
the
thought
of
that
you
dont
dare
let
us
leave
yet
you
cant
stop
us
because
i
have
your
blaster
and
id
just
as
soon
shoot
you
as
look
at
your
rotten
face
now
get
on
your
feet
and
start
climbing
if
you
want
to
stay
alive
were
getting
out
of
here
and
youll
fry
inside
this
pit
where
are
you
taking
me
back
to
your
airboat
im
going
to
tie
you
up
and
set
you
off
on
autopilot
youll
be
able
to
get
loose
quickly
enough
but
itll
be
too
late
to
stop
us
well
be
gone
and
you
can
think
of
how
youll
manage
to
face
the
human
race
i
hope
you
blow
yourself
and
that
antique
clear
out
of
space
we
might
but
youll
never
know
for
sure
but
mark
thisif
i
live
ill
be
back
with
the
brotherhood
you
can
count
on
it
they
struggled
up
the
side
of
the
pit
and
halted
panting
on
the
rim
how
much
radiation
was
down
there
douglas
asked
worriedly
not
enough
to
hurt
you
thats
good
douglas
accepted
the
statement
at
face
value
a
fact
which
failed
to
surprise
kennon
you
know
he
said
ive
been
around
lani
all
my
life
and
i
know
that
theyre
not
human
no
selfrespecting
human
would
take
a
tenth
of
what
they
put
up
with
their
ancestors
didnt
kennon
said
they
fought
to
the
end
but
your
grandfather
was
a
smart
man
even
though
he
was
a
degrader
he
wasnt
douglas
exploded
no
alexander
is
a
degrader
he
realized
kennon
went
on
that
hed
never
succeed
in
enslaving
the
lani
unless
he
separated
the
sexes
and
since
women
are
more
subjective
in
their
outlookand
more
pliablehe
picked
them
for
his
slaves
the
males
he
retired
to
stud
probably
the
fact
that
there
were
more
women
than
men
helped
him
make
up
his
mind
in
every
society
kennon
went
on
inexorably
there
are
potential
freeman
and
potential
slaves
the
latter
invariably
outnumber
the
former
theyre
cowards
the
timid
the
unsacrificingthe
ones
that
want
peace
at
any
pricethe
ones
who
will
trade
freedom
for
security
those
were
the
ones
who
hid
rather
than
risk
their
lives
fighting
the
aggressor
those
were
the
ones
who
survived
old
alexander
had
a
readymade
slave
cadre
when
he
finished
off
the
last
of
the
warriors
for
four
centuries
the
survivors
have
been
bred
and
selected
to
perpetuate
slave
traits
and
the
system
works
the
men
dont
want
freedomthey
want
liberty
to
kill
each
other
the
women
dont
want
freedomthey
want
males
and
theyd
serve
them
precisely
as
the
sarkian
women
serve
their
menfolk
youve
killed
any
chance
they
had
to
become
a
civilization
its
going
to
take
generations
perhaps
before
theyre
reoriented
theres
plenty
you
alexanders
should
answer
for
if
theres
any
fault
its
yours
douglas
snarled
we
were
doing
all
right
until
you
came
here
wed
still
be
doing
all
right
if
i
had
shot
you
both
his
shoulders
sagged
i
should
have
killed
you
when
i
had
the
chance
he
said
bitterly
but
you
didnt
kennon
said
and
to
show
my
gratitude
im
letting
you
get
away
with
a
whole
skin
i
dont
expect
you
to
be
grateful
but
at
least
youll
not
be
on
my
conscience
i
dont
enjoy
killing
not
even
things
like
you
douglas
sneered
youre
softa
soft
sentimental
fool
admitted
kennon
said
but
thats
my
nature
yet
youd
destroy
the
family
wreck
outworld
enterprises
and
throw
a
whole
world
into
chaos
over
a
few
thousand
animals
i
dont
understand
you
theyre
human
kennon
said
flatly
admitting
they
might
once
have
been
theyre
not
now
and
whose
fault
is
that
not
ours
douglas
said
promptly
if
there
is
any
fault
its
that
of
the
court
who
decided
they
were
humanoid
you
didnt
help
any
why
should
we
does
one
treat
a
shrake
like
a
brotheror
a
varlor
a
dog
we
treat
them
like
the
animals
they
are
and
weve
done
no
worse
with
the
lani
our
consciences
are
clear
kennon
laughed
humorlessly
yet
this
clear
conscience
makes
you
want
to
kill
me
so
you
can
keep
on
treating
them
as
animalseven
though
you
know
theyre
human
i
know
nothing
of
the
sort
but
youre
right
about
the
killing
id
kill
you
cheerfully
if
i
had
the
chance
its
our
necks
if
you
get
away
with
this
of
course
you
probably
wont
but
why
take
the
chance
i
like
my
neck
more
than
i
like
yours
youre
honest
at
any
rate
kennon
admitted
and
in
a
way
i
dont
blame
you
to
you
its
probably
better
to
be
a
rich
slaver
living
off
the
legacy
of
a
degrader
than
a
penniless
humanitarian
but
youve
lost
your
chance
douglas
screamed
with
rage
he
whirled
on
kennon
his
face
a
distorted
mask
of
hate
hold
it
kennon
barked
i
dont
want
to
kill
you
but
ill
burn
a
hole
clear
through
your
rotten
carcass
if
you
make
another
move
i
have
no
love
for
your
kind
douglas
spat
contemptuously
you
havent
got
the
guts
he
snarled
but
he
didnt
move
just
stand
stillvery
still
kennon
said
softly
the
iron
in
his
voice
was
not
hidden
by
the
quiet
tone
douglas
shivered
ill
get
you
yet
he
said
but
there
was
no
force
in
the
threat
heres
the
rope
you
wanted
copper
said
as
she
emerged
abruptly
from
the
darkness
i
had
a
hard
time
finding
it
you
havent
been
too
long
kennon
said
now
tie
douglas
hands
behind
him
while
i
keep
him
covered
its
a
pleasure
copper
murmured
chapter
xviii
im
frightened
copper
said
twisting
uncomfortably
in
the
shock
chair
beside
kennons
after
you
have
been
so
brave
kennon
asked
thats
nonsense
its
just
nervous
reaction
now
web
in
like
i
showed
you
its
time
for
blastoff
we
dont
dare
wait
much
longer
all
rightbut
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
isnt
right
something
is
going
to
go
wrong
i
hope
you
dont
have
precognition
kennon
smiled
ive
checked
everything
the
ship
is
as
good
as
shell
ever
be
theres
nothing
more
that
we
can
do
theres
one
consolation
copper
said
wanly
at
well
die
together
theres
a
better
chance
that
well
live
together
i
hope
so
ready
kennon
asked
she
nodded
he
flipped
the
switches
that
would
send
the
fuel
rods
into
the
reactor
below
them
a
soft
barely
audible
whine
ascended
the
sonic
scale
to
a
point
of
irritating
inaudibility
kennon
smiled
the
spindizzy
was
functioning
properly
he
flipped
a
second
bank
of
switches
and
a
dull
roar
came
from
the
buried
stem
ashes
and
pumice
heated
to
incandescence
were
blown
through
the
air
molten
drops
of
radioactive
lava
skittered
across
the
durilium
hull
as
kennon
advanced
the
power
the
whole
stem
of
the
ship
was
immersed
in
a
seething
lake
of
bolling
rock
as
the
egg
lifted
slowly
with
ponderous
dignity
into
the
night
sky
hang
on
kennon
said
im
going
to
hyper
his
hand
moved
a
red
lever
and
the
egg
shimmered
and
vanished
with
a
peculiar
wrenching
motion
into
an
impossible
direction
that
the
mind
could
not
grasp
and
the
interceptor
missile
from
otpen
one
nosed
through
the
space
the
egg
had
occupied
we
made
it
kennon
said
looking
across
the
writhing
semifluid
control
board
shifting
oddly
in
the
harsh
yellow
monochromatic
light
that
pervaded
the
cabin
the
screens
were
leaking
like
sieves
but
they
were
holding
well
enough
to
keep
cth
yellow
from
being
anything
more
than
an
annoyance
he
glanced
over
at
copper
a
fantastically
elongated
copper
who
looked
like
a
madmans
dream
of
chaos
and
copper
screamed
the
sound
echoed
and
reechoed
dying
away
with
a
lingering
discordant
reverberation
that
made
his
skin
tingle
copper
its
all
right
its
all
fight
stop
it
copper
screamed
again
and
her
elongated
figure
suddenly
foreshortened
and
collapsed
into
a
small
writhing
ball
from
which
two
small
pink
hands
emerged
clutching
at
a
gelid
mass
of
air
that
flowed
sluggishly
around
them
and
kennon
knew
what
he
had
forgotten
hyperspace
with
leaky
screens
was
nothing
to
inflict
upon
an
unprepared
mind
it
is
one
thing
to
endure
partial
exposure
after
months
of
training
with
experienced
medics
standing
by
to
help
you
through
the
shock
phase
but
quite
another
to
be
thrust
from
a
safe
and
sheltered
existence
into
the
mind
shattering
distortions
of
the
cth
continuum
the
egg
was
old
her
screens
never
good
at
best
were
hardly
more
than
filters
through
the
hull
through
the
drive
lattice
the
viciously
distorted
cth
environment
seeped
into
the
ship
turning
prosaic
shapes
of
controls
and
instruments
into
writhing
masses
of
obscene
horror
that
sent
extensions
wiggling
off
into
nothingness
at
eyeaching
angles
a
spaceman
could
take
thisknowing
it
wasnt
realbut
a
tyro
could
not
copper
collapsed
her
mind
assaulted
by
sensations
no
untrained
person
should
experience
went
into
shock
but
she
wasnt
granted
the
mercy
of
unconsciousness
terrified
by
a
pseudo
reality
that
surpassed
her
wildest
nightmares
she
stared
wideeyed
at
the
control
room
and
the
thing
that
had
been
kennon
she
screamed
until
her
throat
was
raw
until
the
monster
beside
her
touched
her
with
kennons
hands
then
mercifully
she
felt
a
stinging
in
her
arm
and
all
sensation
ceased
kennon
stared
glumly
at
the
controls
fleming
alone
knew
how
many
objective
years
were
passing
outside
as
they
hurtled
through
fourspace
subjectively
it
would
only
be
hours
aboard
the
egg
but
a
decadeor
maybe
a
centurymight
pass
outside
this
mad
universe
where
neither
time
nor
speed
had
meaning
the
old
ships
didnt
have
temporal
compensators
nor
could
they
travel
through
upper
bands
of
cth
where
subjective
and
objective
time
were
more
nearly
equal
they
were
trapped
in
a
semistasis
of
time
as
the
ship
fled
on
through
the
distorted
monochromatic
regions
that
bypassed
normal
space
the
egg
slipped
smoothly
out
of
the
hyper
jump
back
into
the
normal
universe
beta
floated
above
them
the
blue
shield
of
her
atmosphere
shining
softly
in
the
light
of

couldnt
hit
it
that
good
again
in

kennon
gloated
halfway
across
the
galaxyand
right
on
the
nose
he
looked
at
the

him

kennon
said
kennon
lowered
the

through
the
overcast
ground
control
picked
him
up
smoothly
and
took
him
down
as
though
it
had
been

what

startled
voice
came
over
the

its
an
old
one
kennon
said
thats
a
gross
understatement
stand
by
for
boarders
ambulance
coming
up
kennon
opened
the
airlock
and
two
radiationsuited
men
entered
at
least
you
had
sense
enough
to
wear
protective
clothing
in
this
hotbox
one
said
as
they
carefully
unwebbed
copper
and
carried
her
out
of
the
lock
you
wait
here
the
port
captain
wants
to
see
you
where
are
you
taking
her
what
center
kennon
asked
what
should
you
care
youve
nearly
killed
her
the
idea
of
taking
a
pregnant
woman
up
in
this
death
trap
what
in
flemings
names
the
matter
with
your
brain
i
had
to
kennon
said
i
had
to
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
for
once
he
thought
wryly
the
cliche
was
true
the
betans
face
behind
the
transparent
helmet
was
disgusted
and
unbelieving
i
hear
that
sort
of
thing
every
day
he
said
am
i
supposed
to
believe
it
youd
believe
it
if
youd
have
been
where
i
was
kennon
muttered
nowwhere
are
you
taking
her
he
demanded
the
man
arched
blond
eyebrows
to
the
local
medical
centerwhere
else
theres
only
one
in
this
area
thanks
kennon
said
he
watched
the
ambulance
flit
off
as
he
waited
for
the
spaceport
patrol
there
was
no
further
need
for
the
protection
suit
so
he
peeled
it
off
and
hung
it
in
the
controlroom
locker
copper
was
right
he
mused
it
did
itch
the
port
captains
men
were
late
as
usualmoving
gingerly
through
the
radiation
area
a
noncom
gestured
for
him
to
enter
their
carryall
port
captain
wants
to
see
you
he
said
i
know
kennon
replied
you
should
have
waited
upstairs
i
couldnt
it
was
a
matter
of
medicine
kennon
said
the
noncoms
face
sobered
why
didnt
you
say
so
all
you
said
was
that
it
was
an
emergency
ive
been
away
i
forgot
you
shouldnt
have
done
that
youre
a
betan
arent
you
kennon
nodded
they
drove
to
the
port
office
where
kennon
expectedand
gota
bad
time
from
the
port
officials
he
filled
out
numerous
forms
signed
affidavits
explained
his
unauthorized
landing
showed
his
spacemans
ticket
defended
his
act
of
piloting
without
an
uptodate
license
signed
more
forms
entered
a
claim
for
salvage
rights
to
the
egg
and
finally
when
the
legal
division
the
traffic
control
division
the
spaceport
safety
office
customs
immigration
and
travelers
aid
had
finished
with
him
he
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
port
captain
the
redfaced
chunky
officer
eyed
him
with
a
cold
stare
youll
be
lucky
young
man
if
you
get
out
of
this
with
a
year
in
correction
your
story
doesnt
hang
together
it
didnt
kennon
thought
but
there
was
no
sense
telling
all
of
it
to
a
port
captain
under
no
circumstances
could
the
man
be
any
help
to
him
he
had
neither
the
power
nor
the
prestige
to
request
a
brotherhood
board
of
inquiry
in
rank
he
was
hardly
more
than
a
glorified
traffic
control
officer
it
would
do
no
good
to
tell
him
an
improbable
tale
of
slavery
on
a
distant
planet
the
only
thing
to
do
was
wait
out
the
storm
and
hope
it
would
pass
if
worst
came
to
worst
hed
use
his
rank
but
hed
made
enough
stir
already
he
doubted
if
the
captain
had
authority
to
order
him
into
detentionbut
he
was
certain
to
get
a
lecture
these
minor
officials
loved
to
tell
someone
off
he
gritted
his
teeth
hed
endure
it
for
coppers
sakeand
to
get
out
of
here
quietly
alexander
would
undoubtedly
have
agents
posted
by
now
and
his
only
chance
for
temporary
freedom
of
action
was
to
get
out
of
here
with
as
little
fuss
as
possible
he
sat
quietly
his
flushed
face
and
tight
jaw
muscles
betraying
his
impatience
as
the
captain
paced
up
and
down
and
talked
on
and
on
the
man
sounded
like
he
could
go
for
hours
with
increasing
impatience
kennon
listened
to
the
cadenced
flow
of
complaint
and
condemnation
occasionally
inserting
a
yes
sir
or
sorry
sir
or
no
sir
as
the
words
flowed
around
him
however
there
had
to
be
a
breaking
point
somewhere
and
the
monotony
was
beginning
to
wear
his
temper
thin
another
five
minutes
he
reflected
was
about
all
he
could
take
the
door
chime
rang
softly
come
in
the
port
captain
said
breaking
off
in
midtirade
the
change
in
his
manner
was
so
abrupt
that
kennon
couldnt
help
smiling
a
young
blond
man
in
an
internes
gray
uniform
entered
the
room
yes
doctor
the
port
captain
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
do
you
have
a
jac
kennon
here
dr
jac
kennon
did
you
say
doctor
the
port
captain
said
in
a
halfstrangled
voice
you
never
let
me
tell
you
kennon
said
mildly
that
my
landing
here
was
a
matter
of
medicine
technically
you
have
contributed
to
a
delay
in
treatment
the
port
captains
face
paled
why
didnt
you
say
something
he
said
against
your
gale
of
wind
i
would
be
but
a
faint
breeze
kennon
said
coldly
he
turned
to
the
interne
im
dr
kennon
they
bowed
formally
to
each
other
im
smalley
sir
from
the
medical
center
dr
brainard
sends
his
compliments
and
requests
that
you
join
him
for
consultation
the
port
captain
kennon
began
dont
worry
about
it
doctor
ill
relinquish
responsibility
to
dr
brainard
the
captain
said
i
have
placed
a
formal
written
request
with
your
office
smalley
said
stiffly
you
are
relieved
of
further
charge
dr
kennon
is
urgently
needed
it
is
a
matter
of
medicine
the
captain
looked
relieved
on
beta
it
was
poor
policy
to
interfere
with
the
doings
of
doctors
and
engineersor
even
doctors
of
philosophy
very
well
hes
yoursand
im
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
the
port
captain
bowed
to
kennon
and
smalley
and
stalked
out
of
the
office
pompous
little
man
kennon
observed
but
he
certainly
can
talk
ohyou
know
these
administrative
people
the
interne
said
depreciatingly
one
mustnt
mind
them
theyre
necessary
nuisances
he
eyed
kennon
curiously
how
is
it
that
you
didnt
stand
on
your
professional
rights
i
have
my
reasonsbut
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
medicine
ohi
see
ethical
the
internes
voice
was
faintly
sarcastic
manners
doctormanners
kennons
voice
was
gentle
but
the
interne
flushed
a
dull
red
sorry
sir
dont
mention
it
its
normal
for
a
graduate
to
confuse
liberty
with
license
kennon
smiled
dont
worry
i
shant
report
you
thats
good
of
you
sir
smalleys
face
registered
relief
demerits
were
difficult
to
eraseparticularly
ones
of
courtesy
kennon
wondered
if
the
young
man
would
report
himself
he
doubted
it
the
interne
didnt
look
the
typeprobably
he
was
dated
for
some
obscure
job
like
a
general
practitioner
he
shrugged
it
took
all
kinds
to
make
a
profession
even
the
smalleys
had
their
place
that
girl
you
brought
in
smalley
said
as
they
entered
a
white
car
emblazoned
with
the
three
crosses
red
blue
and
green
that
represented
the
three
fields
of
medicine
shes
an
interesting
case
ive
never
seen
space
shock
before
and
the
patient
herselfone
would
hardly
believe
she
was
a
betan
she
isnt
kennon
said
so
blond
eyebrows
rose
in
inverted
us
of
surprise
but
thats
hardly
possible
our
tests
indicate
dont
you
think
that
this
is
a
matter
for
dr
brainard
kennon
said
icily
protocol
of
course
stupid
of
mebut
the
case
is
so
interesting
half
the
center
staff
have
seen
her
already
i
wasnt
proposing
to
discuss
the
case
it
wouldnt
be
proper
even
though
you
are
only
a
veterinarian
only
kennons
voice
was
hard
i
shouldnt
have
to
remind
you
of
this
mr
smalleybut
i
have
been
for
the
past
two
years
on
a
world
of
bad
manners
i
expected
better
here
at
home
smalley
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
strawcolored
hair
sorry
doctor
he
muttered
i
dont
know
whats
the
matter
with
me
i
can
tell
you
kennon
said
youve
just
graduated
how
did
you
know
smalley
said
i
was
a
graduate
once
myselfnot
too
long
ago
how
long
sir
class
of
eightyseven
thats
twelve
years
ago
smalley
said
kennon
nodded
ten
years
lost
not
badnot
bad
at
all
but
alexander
could
have
done
a
lot
in
ten
years
i
meant
no
disrespect
smalley
said
worriedly
i
know
it
but
if
you
intend
to
practice
on
beta
youd
better
polish
your
professional
manner
now
where
i
was
it
didnt
make
much
difference
laymen
often
called
me
doc
smalley
was
properly
shocked
i
hope
you
didnt
encourage
them
sir
it
was
impossible
to
discourage
them
kennon
said
after
all
when
the
man
who
hires
you
ohentrepreneurs
smalley
said
in
a
tone
that
explained
everything
the
car
stopped
in
front
of
the
medical
centers
staff
entrance
this
way
sir
smalley
said
he
led
the
way
down
a
greentiled
corridor
to
an
elevatorthen
down
another
corridor
past
a
pair
of
softfooted
nurses
who
eyed
them
curiouslylooking
at
kennons
tunic
and
sandals
with
mild
disapproval
in
their
eyes
smalley
stopped
and
knocked
softly
on
a
closed
door
enter
said
a
pleasant
baritone
voice
from
the
annunciator
dr
brainarddr
kennon
smalley
said
kennon
liked
the
man
instantly
a
plump
pinkcheeked
man
of
middle
age
with
prematurely
white
hair
dr
will
brainard
combined
a
fatherly
appearance
with
an
impression
of
quick
intelligence
the
fat
that
sheathed
his
stocky
body
had
obviously
not
touched
his
mind
brainard
rose
from
the
deep
chair
near
the
window
where
he
had
been
sitting
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
bowed
stiffly
his
eyessharp
points
of
blue
in
the
smooth
pinkness
of
his
facesurveyed
kennon
curiously
so
youre
the
young
man
who
takes
untrained
pregnant
women
for
rides
in
oldfashioned
spacers
he
said
didnt
you
know
what
would
happen
i
was
in
a
hurry
doctor
kennon
said
obviously
now
tell
me
about
it
brainard
looked
at
the
eagerfaced
interne
standing
behind
kennon
that
will
be
all
smalley
he
said
kennon
waited
until
the
door
closed
ordinarily
he
said
id
never
have
done
a
thing
like
that
but
there
were
some
very
pressing
reasons
however
i
should
have
given
her
an
injection
of
somnol
before
we
started
im
criminally
liable
if
anything
happens
to
her
his
voice
was
tight
with
worry
youd
give
her
an
injection
brainard
said
i
hope
you
didnt
mean
that
but
i
did
sir
ive
given
thousands
of
lani
injections
whats
a
lani
she
is
sir
the
impression
has
been
that
her
race
isnt
human
nonsenseits
obvious
she
is
a
brotherhood
court
of
inquiry
didnt
think
so
hmm
is
that
so
yes
sirbut
before
i
go
on
tell
me
how
is
she
oh
shell
be
fine
a
little
mental
therapy
and
plenty
of
rest
are
all
she
needs
shes
a
remarkably
healthy
young
woman
but
this
is
beside
the
point
there
are
a
number
of
unusual
features
about
this
case
that
need
investigation
brainard
took
a
standard
hospital
form
from
his
desk
mind
if
i
ask
you
some
questions
doctor
not
at
all
but
you
are
due
for
some
unpleasant
shocks
as
you
go
through
that
form
i
believe
i
can
survive
them
brainard
said
dryly
this
is
professional
confidence
kennon
began
of
course
of
course
brainard
said
impatiently
now
lets
get
on
with
it
this
is
the
most
amazing
tale
ive
ever
heard
brainard
said
slowly
are
you
certain
you
are
telling
the
truth
kennon
grinned
i
dont
blame
you
for
not
believing
mebut
the
evidence
is
conclusive
and
there
is
enough
documentary
evidence
in
the
space
shipand
in
the
fact
of
the
ship
itself
to
prove
what
i
am
saying
laboratory
tests
here
will
establish
the
fact
that
coppers
child
is
also
mine
and
as
for
flora
a
brotherhood
investigation
team
can
prove
that
part
that
will
be
attended
to
brainard
said
grimly
but
how
did
you
deduce
she
wasnt
from
a
betan
colony
kennon
asked
brainard
smiled
that
wasnt
hard
her
sun
tan
and
the
condition
of
her
feet
proved
she
was
a
practicing
nudist
no
betan
girl
ever
practices
nudism
to
my
knowledge
besides
the
id
tattoo
under
her
left
arm
and
the
v
on
her
hip
are
no
marks
of
our
culture
then
there
was
another
thingthe
serological
analysis
revealed
no
gerontal
antibodies
she
had
never
received
an
injection
of
longevity
compound
in
her
life
this
might
occur
but
its
highly
improbable
the
evidence
indicates
that
shes
extrabetan
kennon
nodded
but
this
business
of
her
being
fifteen
years
old
thats
impossible
she
has
the
development
of
a
woman
of
twentyfive
remember
the
alpha
v
colony
kennon
said
of
courseohi
see
it
could
be
something
like
that
certainlystrong
yellow
gtype
sunan
isolated
colony
serviced
at
twentyyear
intervalsthere
was
a
marked
physical
precocity
and
if
this
had
been
continued
for
several
millennia
kennon
asked
hmmi
see
yes
its
possible
on
alpha
v
the
colonists
grew
from
infancy
to
maturity
in
fifteen
years
and
wasnt
heaven
one
of
our
early
colonies
yesit
was
established
after
the
great
schism
near
the
end
of
the
first
millenniumwhen
science
and
religion
split
irrevocably
on
this
world
we
packed
the
whole
lot
of
them
off
to
a
world
of
their
own
where
they
could
develop
as
they
pleased
they
called
it
heavenodd
name
for
a
fogworldbut
theres
no
accounting
for
tastes
brainard
chuckled
i
thought
that
was
the
case
but
i
couldnt
remember
my
ancient
history
is
pretty
weak
you
should
read
more
brainard
said
but
as
i
see
itthis
girl
is
of
betan
ancestry
providing
your
theory
and
the
facts
coincide
which
could
also
explain
why
an
outworld
species
of
agerone
would
be
toxic
they
tried
to
prolong
lani
life
and
met
with
failure
our
plants
are
mutant
forms
just
as
we
are
a
mutant
race
brainard
said
or
partly
mutant
he
sighed
you
have
brought
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
kennon
you
are
bringing
matters
to
a
head
if
our
investigations
prove
your
statements
we
are
morally
bound
to
open
the
lani
question
and
if
those
people
are
of
betan
originthat
fellow
alexander
will
have
plenty
to
answer
for
i
dont
believe
it
is
really
his
fault
kennon
said
slowly
i
dont
think
he
has
ever
known
the
truth
why
didnt
you
tell
him
the
answer
to
that
should
be
obvious
even
though
i
trusted
him
completely
i
could
never
be
sure
he
has
a
free
trader
background
and
those
people
cant
he
trusted
where
moneys
concerned
the
whole
kardonian
culture
is
an
outgrowth
of
free
traderism
small
business
independent
corporation
linear
trusts
and
all
the
cutthroat
competition
such
a
culture
would
naturally
have
its
a
regular
jungle
of
free
enterprise
i
couldnt
predict
how
he
would
react
he
could
either
act
in
a
moral
manner
and
make
restitution
or
he
could
quietly
cut
our
throats
and
go
on
with
his
business
i
see
the
temptation
to
cut
a
throat
might
be
overwhelming
they
fight
commercial
wars
kennon
said
disgustingutterly
uncivilized
under
the
circumstances
you
had
no
other
course
still
they
have
no
moral
right
to
enslave
human
beings
there
is
always
the
element
of
doubt
maybe
they
didnt
know
after
all
an
impartial
court
declared
the
lani
alienand
the
betan
mutation
isnt
known
throughout
the
brotherhood
one
doesnt
go
around
broadcasting
data
on
the
variations
of
ones
germ
plasm
brainard
said
thats
a
private
affaira
matter
of
personal
privacy
and
public
safety
brainard
nodded
were
no
more
courageous
than
any
other
civilization
we
have
no
desire
to
borrow
trouble
we
are
content
to
leave
things
alone
thats
the
trouble
kennon
said
were
all
content
to
leave
things
alone
if
i
hadnt
found
the
spaceship
id
not
have
been
able
to
lay
aside
my
moral
conditioning
and
if
i
had
not
copper
would
not
have
become
pregnant
and
forced
me
into
these
drastic
actions
its
even
possible
that
i
would
have
done
nothing
he
grimaced
and
when
i
left
alexanders
employment
mnemonic
erasure
would
have
removed
all
memory
of
the
lanis
human
origin
he
shrugged
i
still
am
not
certain
that
it
wouldnt
have
been
the
wiser
course
naturally
once
i
knew
i
couldnt
do
anything
else
than
what
i
did
naturally
brainard
said
humanity
reaches
the
heights
when
it
faces
questions
of
moral
responsibility
to
mankind
kennon
added
heavily
we
have
a
convenient
blind
spot
regarding
our
moral
responsibility
to
other
intelligent
races
a
harsh
fact
but
trueand
who
is
to
judge
whether
it
is
right
or
wrong
we
achieved
dominance
of
earth
by
our
moral
responsibility
to
family
tribe
and
nationand
we
nearly
exterminated
ourselves
when
we
forgot
that
this
responsibility
went
beyond
nations
and
embraced
all
mankind
we
learned
that
after
the
exodus
as
for
the
other
racesperhaps
someday
we
will
learn
moral
responsibility
for
all
intelligencebut
we
are
not
ready
for
that
yet
thats
too
big
a
mental
hurdle
brainard
sighed
we
are
what
we
are
and
we
change
slowly
but
we
change
true
enough
kennon
said
but
its
hard
to
be
philosophical
about
it
youre
young
live
a
couple
of
centuries
and
you
will
understand
patience
kennon
smiled
you
know
brainard
said
thoughtfully
you
still
have
plenty
of
things
to
do
i
know
ill
have
to
make
a
transcript
of
this
discussion
have
it
witnessed
and
make
a
sealed
record
i
have
to
arrange
for
the
reposition
of
the
evidence
inside
the
egg
and
a
complete
recording
of
the
egg
itself
and
to
be
safe
youll
need
several
facsimiles
properly
attested
the
arms
of
these
outworld
entrepreneurs
are
long
and
unfortunately
not
all
betans
are
models
of
honesty
id
better
get
started
then
let
me
help
you
brainard
said
i
have
a
little
influence
in
this
areaand
your
cause
interests
me
he
picked
up
the
phone
on
his
desk
kennon
sighed
he
had
found
an
ally
chapter
xix
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
girl
brainard
asked
formalize
our
mating
as
soon
as
she
is
able
to
get
out
of
bed
kennon
replied
she
is
an
ignorant
untrained
savage
brainard
protested
you
should
hear
the
stories
the
nurses
tell
about
her
kennon
chuckled
you
dont
have
to
tell
me
about
those
ive
lived
with
lani
for
two
years
but
shes
not
stupid
what
are
your
plans
after
we
establish
her
humanity
legally
kennon
said
im
going
to
send
her
to
school
for
twenty
years
if
necessary
but
i
dont
think
it
will
take
that
long
she
has
some
schooling
but
no
trainingand
what
of
the
lani
in
the
meantime
i
have
plans
for
that
im
going
back
to
kardon
and
give
alexander
a
chance
to
make
restitution
i
think
he
is
an
honorable
man
slavery
may
be
as
revolting
to
him
as
it
is
to
any
civilized
human
he
deserves
a
chance
to
rectify
his
grandfathers
error
that
is
reasonableand
in
the
best
traditions
of
the
brotherhood
furthermore
its
practical
kennon
said
alexander
is
the
only
one
fully
qualified
to
handle
the
problems
of
enfranchisement
hes
known
the
lani
all
his
life
and
he
is
an
executive
type
a
brotherhood
committee
would
probably
botch
the
whole
affair
what
with
colonial
jurisdiction
territorial
rights
and
all
the
legal
quibbling
that
committees
love
the
lani
would
get
a
poor
deal
and
theres
no
reason
to
wreck
the
lives
of
a
couple
of
hundred
million
kardonians
because
the
rightful
owners
of
kardon
were
illegally
enslaved
that
happened
too
long
ago
to
have
any
practical
meaning
there
are
other
and
better
solutions
what
how
should
i
know
kennon
asked
but
im
sure
alexander
will
thats
his
field
all
you
have
to
worry
about
is
whether
hell
cooperate
brainard
said
hell
cooperate
once
he
knows
the
score
kennon
said
confidently
and
hell
have
to
make
some
form
of
restitution
but
it
shouldnt
involve
kardon
actually
the
lani
were
never
in
a
position
to
develop
that
world
theyd
probably
have
remained
on
flora
indefinitely
the
old
court
records
showed
no
tendency
for
their
culture
to
expand
they
were
an
inbred
group
a
static
balanced
society
in
harmony
with
their
environment
in
nearly
thirtyfive
hundred
years
their
numbers
increased
only
to
a
few
thousand
actually
there
is
a
good
possibility
that
the
race
would
ultimately
have
died
out
if
old
alexander
hadnt
enslaved
them
and
instituted
a
controlled
breeding
program
there
are
more
lani
alive
today
than
there
were
at
the
height
of
their
power
so
in
a
way
old
alexander
did
them
a
favor
he
kept
their
race
alive
all
we
can
expect
is
a
fair
and
just
settlement
but
if
alexander
doesnt
cooperate
thats
where
you
come
in
youll
be
a
watchdog
if
you
dont
receive
annual
progress
reports
from
meand
see
or
talk
to
me
personally
every
second
year
you
are
released
from
our
bond
and
can
do
what
you
wish
with
the
evidence
ive
accumulated
wed
better
get
this
into
private
record
brainard
said
we
can
transcribe
an
agreement
and
place
it
in
the
public
repository
a
good
idea
and
wed
better
waste
no
time
alexander
might
still
be
looking
for
meand
if
he
is
its
merely
a
question
of
time
before
he
catches
up
ten
years
have
passed
its
doubtful
but
we
could
keep
you
here
at
the
center
kennon
shook
his
head
too
dangerous
and
besides
it
would
compromise
you
nowell
get
everything
possible
done
to
make
the
lanis
case
airtight
and
then
ill
return
to
kardon
it
will
put
our
case
in
a
better
light
if
it
ever
comes
to
trial
if
i
go
back
voluntarily
anywayim
morally
bound
to
return
now
lets
make
this
record
its
your
decision
brainard
said
and
its
your
neckbut
i
must
admit
that
i
agree
with
you
ill
feel
safer
when
we
get
the
legal
details
clarified
kennon
said
and
what
of
the
girl
can
you
take
care
of
her
if
i
have
to
leave
quickly
of
course
ill
give
her
personal
attention
and
after
she
has
her
child
ill
see
that
she
is
sent
to
you
thats
decent
of
you
doctor
its
my
moral
responsibility
brainard
said
as
he
slipped
a
new
tape
into
the
recorder
copper
responded
quickly
to
rest
and
therapy
the
space
shock
cleared
up
quickly
the
gerontological
treatments
put
her
to
bed
again
but
within
a
month
she
was
completely
normal
and
her
lifespan
was
now
that
of
a
normal
human
she
could
look
forward
to
some
four
hundred
years
with
kennonand
the
prospect
was
not
unpleasant
the
center
fascinated
her
never
before
had
she
seen
a
hospital
devoted
to
the
care
and
treatment
of
humans
it
was
a
far
cry
in
its
polished
steel
and
stone
magnificence
from
the
tiny
primitive
structure
over
which
kennon
had
presided
yet
both
places
served
the
same
purpose
perhaps
kennon
was
rightthat
there
was
no
difference
between
man
and
lani
the
idea
was
not
nearly
as
unbelievable
as
it
was
at
first
i
never
realized
what
it
meant
to
be
human
copper
said
as
she
held
kennons
hand
it
is
nice
to
feel
important
and
to
know
that
our
child
is
a
member
of
the
race
that
rules
the
galaxy
so
youre
convinced
kennon
chuckled
the
serological
identity
she
began
hmm
youve
been
getting
some
education
i
see
well
copper
smiled
i
didnt
think
you
wanted
a
stupid
woman
i
can
readand
since
you
are
around
so
seldom
nowadays
there
is
little
else
to
do
ive
been
reading
history
medicine
and
novels
she
finished
proudly
a
fine
catholic
selection
kennon
said
now
if
you
add
mathematics
sociology
and
philosophy
youll
have
a
wellrounded
basic
education
dr
brainard
has
been
trying
something
he
calls
hypno
he
says
it
will
help
me
learn
faster
but
i
cant
see
that
its
done
much
good
you
wont
until
you
need
the
information
kennon
said
that
technique
is
only
good
for
implanting
basic
knowledge
and
much
of
that
will
merely
supplement
or
complete
that
which
you
already
have
you
wont
be
conscious
of
it
ohi
think
i
see
what
you
mean
of
course
youll
have
to
continue
your
formal
education
theres
a
great
deal
for
you
to
learn
it
should
keep
you
busy
while
im
away
away
where
are
you
going
back
to
kardon
but
you
cant
alexander
will
destroy
you
i
think
not
after
all
ten
years
have
elapsed
since
we
left
there
and
hes
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
douglas
must
have
told
him
about
us
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
he
has
already
done
something
about
your
people
she
shivered
he
mightbut
the
question
is
what
would
he
do
he
could
have
killed
them
all
kennon
shook
his
head
i
dont
think
so
he
never
struck
me
as
a
mass
murderer
she
shook
her
head
you
dont
know
the
alexanders
like
i
do
i
was
raised
by
them
theyre
capable
of
anything
but
what
is
this
business
of
ten
years
thats
silly
i
havent
had
my
child
yetand
it
doesnt
take
ten
years
of
pregnancy
to
produce
a
baby
its
the
difference
between
subjective
and
objective
time
kennon
said
we
traveled
here
through
hyperspacelow
cthin
an
uncompensated
ship
and
there
is
little
temporal
flow
in
the
levels
below
the
blue
ohof
course
kennon
chuckled
that
would
have
been
greek
to
you
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
see
where
that
basic
data
fits
but
ive
always
known
that
you
just
think
you
have
search
your
memory
and
see
if
im
not
right
copper
shook
her
head
its
very
strange
she
said
but
thats
not
important
this
idea
of
going
back
to
kardon
thoughthats
a
different
thingthat
is
important
i
have
to
do
it
not
only
because
its
a
personal
moral
obligation
but
also
because
of
the
lani
they
must
have
their
freedom
providing
there
are
any
still
alive
stop
being
a
calamity
howler
whatever
alexander
may
be
hes
not
a
butcher
he
even
loved
a
lani
once
you
told
me
so
yourself
and
he
couldnt
kill
where
he
loved
she
nodded
i
suppose
youre
right
but
ive
never
lost
my
fear
of
the
man
alexander
he
held
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
me
but
if
you
must
go
then
i
should
go
too
my
obligation
is
greater
than
yours
later
kennon
said
youre
not
ready
to
return
it
will
be
time
enough
after
you
have
learned
some
civilized
habits
coppers
face
lengthened
you
mean
like
wrapping
myself
in
cloth
like
these
people
do
thats
part
of
it
why
cant
they
be
sensibleor
are
they
so
ashamed
of
what
the
gods
gave
them
that
they
must
hide
themselves
no
its
not
that
at
least
not
exactly
its
custom
and
you
must
learn
to
conform
to
customsoutwardly
at
leastno
matter
what
you
may
really
think
isnt
that
a
form
of
lying
copper
asked
i
suppose
so
isnt
that
strange
your
society
exalts
truth
honor
morality
and
intelligenceyet
you
lie
about
your
attitude
its
called
diplomacy
kennon
said
its
part
of
respect
for
others
attitudes
and
beliefs
a
necessary
part
of
human
relationships
then
youd
be
a
nudist
on
santos
of
courseeven
though
i
think
it
isnt
proper
i
couldnt
inflict
my
ideas
and
attitudes
on
the
customs
of
an
independent
world
ohyou
think
im
doing
that
yesand
it
is
a
mark
of
barbarism
sometimes
youre
not
very
nice
copper
said
kennon
smiled
wryly
i
suppose
im
not
he
agreed
ill
try
to
be
civilized
copper
said
but
if
you
go
to
kardonim
going
with
you
perhaps
kennon
said
well
see
how
things
turn
out
you
dont
want
me
to
go
with
you
to
be
honestno
kennon
said
youre
safe
here
and
until
your
status
is
cleared
by
a
brotherhood
court
i
wouldnt
care
to
place
you
in
alexanders
hands
and
clearing
your
status
is
going
to
take
time
you
mean
that
i
am
still
his
property
yes
but
there
is
a
legal
doubt
that
will
prevent
him
from
exercising
his
claim
as
long
as
you
stay
on
beta
in
the
area
where
he
has
power
that
doubt
might
not
hold
so
until
your
status
is
definitely
proven
to
be
human
you
should
not
leave
and
what
happens
if
this
court
denies
my
claim
then
we
appeal
to
the
council
however
with
the
evidence
we
have
your
claim
cannot
reasonably
be
denied
the
only
question
is
one
of
time
it
may
take
years
still
i
dont
think
there
is
anything
to
worry
about
i
dont
think
alexander
will
give
us
any
trouble
but
theres
no
sense
in
taking
chances
you
still
think
im
a
lani
she
said
accusingly
i
do
not
then
you
think
that
id
obey
alexander
after
what
i
did
to
douglas
i
can
only
repeat
that
douglas
isnt
the
bossman
i
wish
i
knew
what
you
really
thought
that
isnt
hard
i
think
you
should
stay
here
until
i
get
this
business
straightened
out
thats
all
she
asked
suspiciously
after
all
i
know
im
not
very
pretty
now
and
theres
lots
of
lani
on
flora
oh
for
ochsners
sake
do
you
think
that
im
he
paused
speechless
just
what
do
you
think
i
am
youre
a
man
and
thats
the
trouble
kennon
chuckled
so
thats
it
you
dont
trust
me
i
love
you
copper
said
sometimes
i
wonder
why
men
ever
finalize
their
status
with
women
kennon
murmured
it
does
no
good
it
doesnt
convince
the
woman
shes
still
fearful
jealous
and
suspiciousalways
belittling
her
ability
to
hold
what
she
has
always
alert
for
competition
clinging
holding
absorbingwhen
she
should
be
working
as
part
of
a
team
thats
not
true
then
prove
it
howby
staying
here
while
you
go
to
the
end
of
the
galaxy
and
play
noble
im
only
doing
what
i
have
to
do
and
so
am
iand
if
you
go
im
going
with
you
kennon
shrugged
there
was
no
sense
arguing
the
only
thing
to
do
was
make
his
plans
and
leave
quietly
if
she
was
faced
with
an
established
fact
she
might
be
more
reasonable
he
doubted
it
but
alone
she
could
do
nothingand
brainard
would
see
that
she
was
comfortable
the
salvage
money
from
the
egg
would
keep
her
from
being
a
public
charge
and
he
had
more
banked
in
albertsville
which
he
could
send
her
once
he
got
there
hed
start
making
plans
to
leave
as
soon
as
possible
copper
looked
up
at
him
as
he
stood
above
her
bed
slowly
she
reached
out
and
placed
one
slim
hand
in
his
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
she
said
and
her
face
twisted
in
a
grimace
of
pain
and
the
hand
in
his
clutched
with
convulsive
strength
at
his
fingers
whats
the
matter
he
said
nothingits
perfectly
normal
she
said
im
just
going
to
give
you
a
son
now
if
youd
call
for
the
doctor
perhaps
we
can
get
this
over
that
pain
was
only
twenty
minutes
from
the
last
i
think
its
about
time
kennonwho
had
attended
several
hundred
lani
births
and
had
developed
a
certain
callousness
about
themwas
suddenly
frightened
and
helpless
as
he
pushed
the
call
button
he
could
feel
the
cold
sweat
form
on
his
forehead
he
had
started
this
it
was
his
fault
if
anything
went
wrong
he
wished
that
it
was
someone
else
rather
than
copper
who
was
going
through
this
trial
he
was
nervous
unsure
and
guilty
in
a
word
he
felt
like
a
man
whose
mate
was
giving
birth
to
their
first
child
its
a
boy
dr
brainard
said
he
smiled
down
at
kennons
haggard
face
how
is
copper
kennon
asked
fineshes
healthy
as
a
horse
kennon
winced
at
the
cliche
it
was
so
ancient
that
it
had
lost
all
meaning
most
betans
didnt
know
what
a
horse
was
let
alone
whether
it
was
healthy
or
not
from
what
kennon
could
remember
of
veterinary
history
the
horse
wasnt
too
healthy
an
animal
it
was
rather
delicate
in
fact
how
is
the
child
kennon
asked
it
took
a
little
courage
to
ask
this
question
the
baby
could
be
anything
from
normal
to
a
monstrosity
perfectly
normal
brainard
said
a
true
betan
type
even
down
to
the
vestigial
tail
we
amputated
that
of
course
thank
ochsner
kennon
breathed
i
was
afraid
of
course
you
were
brainard
said
do
you
want
to
see
them
now
when
i
left
copper
was
asking
for
you
kennon
sighed
leaving
he
realized
wasnt
going
to
be
as
easy
as
he
had
thought
well
have
to
keep
them
here
for
a
couple
of
months
brainard
said
we
must
take
exhaustive
tests
if
we
expect
the
court
to
reverse
its
prior
decision
i
expected
that
kennon
said
he
shrugged
its
probably
best
he
said
now
show
me
where
copper
is
shes
back
in
the
same
room
you
dont
need
a
guide
kennon
didnt
in
fact
he
behaved
quite
admirably
chapter
xx
longliners
kennon
reflected
didnt
make
beta
a
port
of
call
and
the
shortliner
connections
with
other
worlds
were
infrequent
beta
had
done
a
good
job
separating
from
the
rest
of
the
brotherhood
too
good
the
spaceline
schedules
showed
only
one
departure
in
the
next
month
a
shortliner
for
earth
and
from
earth
the
road
to
kardon
was
long
and
tortuous
involving
a
series
of
short
jumps
from
world
to
world
and
a
final
mediumrange
hop
from
halsey
to
kardon
if
everything
went
right
and
he
made
every
connection
he
would
be
in
kardon
four
months
after
he
left
beta
kennon
sighed
as
he
left
travelers
aid
morality
was
a
heavy
load
to
carry
he
walked
slowly
down
the
road
from
the
spaceport
toward
the
cooperative
where
he
had
been
staying
he
had
left
huntersville
and
copper
a
week
ago
after
he
had
seen
his
child
his
child
the
thought
of
being
a
father
was
oddly
dismaying
it
distorted
his
sense
of
values
but
one
thing
was
certain
he
was
returning
to
kardon
and
copper
was
not
coming
with
him
she
had
a
duty
to
their
sonand
he
had
a
duty
to
his
contract
with
alexander
to
the
lani
on
flora
and
to
copperand
none
of
these
could
be
satisfied
by
further
running
he
had
to
return
and
settle
the
account
a
tall
man
in
a
conservative
yellowandblack
suit
was
waiting
patiently
in
front
of
his
room
my
name
is
richter
he
said
art
richter
are
you
dr
jac
kennon
i
could
deny
it
but
i
wont
kennon
said
thank
you
doctor
it
was
just
a
formality
anyway
you
see
i
know
you
by
sight
he
sighed
one
has
to
observe
the
formalities
in
this
business
he
drew
a
long
white
envelope
from
his
tunic
and
handed
it
to
kennon
most
of
my
subjects
try
to
deny
their
identity
he
said
its
a
refreshing
change
to
find
an
honest
man
he
bowed
formally
i
really
thought
this
would
be
harder
considering
the
charges
against
you
he
bowed
again
and
walked
away
nowwhat
was
that
kennon
muttered
as
he
opened
the
envelope
the
man
richter
was
undoubtedly
a
process
serverbut
who
had
hired
him
he
unfolded
the
sheet
and
scanned
the
chargescoercion
larceny
livestock
theft
and
breach
of
contract
he
shrugged
this
was
alexanders
work
what
was
the
man
thinking
of
it
was
insanity
to
bring
the
lani
matter
into
open
court
hadnt
douglas
told
him
what
had
happened
couldnt
alexander
guess
that
he
had
fled
with
copper
for
a
good
reasonone
that
would
stand
up
in
court
didnt
he
know
about
the
spacer
or
had
douglas
turned
on
his
cousin
the
pup
had
so
many
hates
that
it
was
possible
he
was
a
natural
troublemaker
maybe
alexander
didnt
know
maybe
he
was
working
in
the
dark
kennon
scanned
the
sheet
quickly
ah

lifted
the

from
its

dialed

and
waited
hello
he
said
mr
alexander
this
is
dr
kennonyesi
suppose
you
do
but
ive
been
trying
to
get
back
to
kardon
for
the
past
month
you
are
well
thats
your
privilege
but
id
advise
you
to
go
easy
until
i
see
you
naturallyim
coming
as
soon
as
i
can
get
there
well
be
seeing
you
tomorrow
morning
at
the
latest
weim
bringing
copper
of
course
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
kennon
wiped
his
forehead
alexander
sounded
angry
and
dangerous
ten
years
hadnt
served
to
cool
him
off
what
had
happened
on
kardon
after
he
had
left
kennon
shook
his
head
there
was
something
here
he
didnt
understand
the
entrepreneur
should
have
been
covering
his
tracks
not
threatening
jail
and
disaccreditation
it
was
obvious
that
a
personal
visit
was
more
necessary
than
he
had
thought
alexander
was
waiting
his
eyebrows
rose
at
the
sight
of
copper
in
formal
betan
dressand
lifted
a
trifle
more
at
the
sight
of
the
baby
what
is
this
kennon
he
asked
trouble
kennon
said
he
took
off
his
hat
i
came
here
to
settle
things
before
you
took
this
case
to
court
you
obviously
do
not
understand
what
has
happened
i
suppose
douglas
has
doublecrossed
you
it
would
be
characteristic
of
him
but
before
we
go
any
further
i
think
we
should
clear
the
air
and
let
each
other
know
where
we
stand
i
dont
want
to
make
trouble
if
its
not
necessary
youll
notice
im
not
wearing
a
thought
screen
so
youll
be
able
to
check
everything
i
say
and
know
im
telling
the
truth
it
had
better
be
good
alexander
said
grimly
ive
been
looking
for
you
for
ten
years
i
intend
to
throw
the
book
at
you
i
dont
know
whether
my
reason
is
good
or
not
technically
im
guilty
of
breach
of
contract
and
larceny
of
corporation
property
but
there
are
extenuating
circumstances
alexander
chuckled
mirthlessly
there
are
a
few
other
charges
and
quite
probably
i
can
think
of
more
if
you
beat
these
im
going
to
make
an
example
of
you
kennon
im
going
to
drag
you
down
and
stamp
on
you
youre
going
to
be
a
horrible
example
to
all
smart
operators
who
think
they
can
break
contracts
its
taken
a
million
credits
and
ten
years
time
to
hunt
you
down
but
its
going
to
be
worth
it
coppers
child
is
a
boy
kennon
said
mildly
my
son
alexander
froze
you
can
prove
that
he
asked
in
a
halfstrangled
voice
kennon
nodded
you
see
the
extenuating
circumstance
he
asked
suppression
of
human
slavery
alexander
sat
down
it
was
as
though
some
unseen
hand
had
pulled
his
legs
from
under
him
you
believe
it
he
said
noyouve
proved
it
whywhy
didnt
you
tell
me
what
sort
of
a
man
do
you
think
i
am
i
didnt
know
i
couldnt
take
the
chance
until
copper
was
protected
you
see
sir
i
love
her
that
isnt
hard
to
do
with
lani
alexander
said
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
his
face
clouded
his
expression
troubled
it
was
obvious
that
the
realization
shocked
him
kennon
felt
an
odd
sympathy
for
the
entrepreneur
it
wasnt
a
nice
feeling
he
suspected
to
have
the
beliefs
of
a
lifetime
ripped
apart
and
sent
to
the
disposal
chute
so
the
lani
are
a
human
variant
alexander
said
dully
the
proof
is
here
kennon
said
and
the
supporting
evidence
is
conclusive
which
makes
mewhat
a
murderer
a
slaver
a
tyrant
alexander
clutched
his
head
with
leanfingered
hands
what
am
i
an
innocent
victim
of
circumstances
kennon
said
you
didnt
know
none
of
us
knew
and
we
still
wouldnt
know
if
the
lani
werent
of
betan
extraction
he
grimaced
painfully
ive
done
some
soulsearching
myself
and
it
hasnt
been
a
pleasant
task
but
its
nothing
like
mine
alexander
said
in
a
low
voice
i
suspected
they
were
human
when
i
was
younger
but
i
denied
my
suspicions
and
accepted
false
facts
instead
of
investigating
you
would
have
found
nothing
unfortunately
thats
not
true
we
discovered
quite
a
bit
from
the
experimental
station
you
left
us
when
you
disappeared
ten
years
ago
but
we
stopped
when
we
found
the
age
that
was
being
indoctrinated
with
lani
tabus
we
could
have
gone
farther
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
necessary
didnt
douglas
tell
you
kennon
asked
curiously
i
told
him
when
i
turned
him
loose
douglas
didnt
tell
anything
except
that
you
had
somehow
gotten
a
spaceship
i
assumed
it
was
one
of
those
that
were
involved
in
that
commercial
raid
a
few
decades
ago
but
i
see
it
wasnt
noi
knew
nothing
about
this
development
and
douglas
i
guess
wanted
to
keep
it
hidden
he
gave
your
coordinates
and
ordered
mullins
to
launch
a
missile
but
he
apparently
forgot
to
turn
on
his
iff
at
any
rate
the
missile
lost
youbut
found
douglas
douglas
was
still
talking
to
alexandria
when
it
struck
he
might
have
informed
you
kennon
said
if
he
had
more
time
i
doubt
it
he
ordered
the
missile
first
he
was
trying
to
destroy
you
before
you
could
destroy
outworld
enterprises
his
motives
were
selfish
as
usual
alexander
looked
at
kennon
with
a
haggard
eye
i
owe
you
an
apology
he
said
ive
considered
you
responsible
for
douglass
death
for
ten
years
ive
searched
for
you
on
a
hundred
worlds
my
agents
in
every
branch
office
have
had
standing
orders
to
report
any
unusual
arrivals
i
have
hunted
you
personally
i
wanted
to
break
youi
wanted
to
kill
you
i
couldnt
help
the
delay
kennon
said
the
ship
was
old
i
know
youve
told
me
more
than
you
think
im
a
telepath
you
know
ive
never
forgotten
it
kennon
said
that
was
one
of
the
principal
reasons
i
came
here
i
wanted
to
see
how
youd
react
when
you
learned
the
whole
truth
and
i
suppose
you
gloatnoyoure
not
doing
that
but
you
are
right
i
could
have
checked
it
further
but
i
didnt
outworld
enterprises
is
far
bigger
than
floraand
i
was
busy
galactic
trade
is
a
snakepit
and
after
all
there
was
douglass
deathand
the
family
with
their
neverending
clamor
for
money
and
their
threats
when
it
didnt
come
promptly
i
like
being
an
entrepreneur
but
until
i
made
outworld
independent
of
family
control
i
couldnt
do
anything
except
run
the
business
to
their
wishes
actually
the
island
was
only
a
small
part
of
the
corporation
i
tried
to
run
it
as
humanely
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
he
shuddered
i
dont
think
i
was
ever
needlessly
cruel
no
kennon
said
you
were
indifferent
which
is
just
as
bad
alexander
said
wellwhat
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
copper
interjected
you
can
beat
yourself
until
youre
blue
but
that
wont
accomplish
anything
what
are
you
going
to
do
alexander
countered
you
have
the
upper
hand
me
copper
asked
i
have
nothing
this
is
between
you
men
she
lapsed
into
silence
alexander
turned
back
to
kennon
you
have
undoubtedly
made
some
arrangements
you
wouldnt
come
hereoh
i
see
congratulations
handling
the
evidence
that
way
was
a
wise
course
you
have
my
admiration
but
then
i
should
have
known
that
i
was
not
dealing
with
a
fool
he
smiled
wryly
subconsciously
i
think
i
did
knowbut
thats
one
consolation
kennon
grinned
to
be
thought
a
rascal
is
bad
enough
but
to
be
considered
a
fool
is
intolerable
but
your
decision
not
to
use
the
evidence
unless
you
were
forced
tothats
poor
business
but
good
morals
kennon
said
neither
the
brotherhood
nor
i
could
settle
this
affair
it
is
a
matter
only
you
can
handle
there
is
no
sense
in
killing
outworld
or
throwing
kardon
into
centuries
of
litigation
the
lani
never
were
numerous
enough
to
lay
claim
to
an
entire
world
ill
admit
the
club
is
there
but
ill
never
use
it
unless
its
necessary
why
notits
sound
business
practice
im
a
professionalnot
a
businessman
and
besides
i
havent
the
moral
right
to
return
evil
for
good
you
have
not
been
a
bad
boss
thanks
alexander
said
glumly
ive
always
considered
myself
civilized
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
kennon
said
honorable
yescivilized
no
but
none
of
us
are
really
civilized
so
we
havent
changed
much
despite
our
development
perhaps
weve
varied
a
little
physicallyand
weve
learned
to
use
new
tools
but
our
minds
are
still
the
minds
of
barbariansblood
brothers
against
the
enemy
and
everything
not
of
us
is
enemy
savageshiding
under
a
thin
veneer
of
superficial
culture
savages
with
spaceships
and
the
atom
kennon
looked
down
at
copper
apparently
her
thoughts
were
miles
away
in
an
introspective
world
that
was
all
her
own
she
had
said
her
piece
and
having
done
that
was
content
to
let
the
two
men
develop
it
kennon
looked
at
her
with
odd
respect
alexander
eyed
her
with
a
mildly
startled
expression
on
his
lean
face
and
both
men
smiled
but
the
smiles
were
not
amused
judging
from
copper
alexander
said
i
dont
think
well
have
to
worry
about
how
the
lani
will
turn
out
he
looked
at
kennon
with
mild
sympathy
you
are
going
to
have
quite
a
time
with
her
he
said
i
suppose
so
ill
probably
never
know
whether
im
guided
or
whether
im
doing
the
guiding
ive
changed
a
lot
of
my
opinions
about
copper
since
the
day
i
met
her
copper
looked
up
and
smiled
at
them
it
was
an
odd
smile
hinting
at
secrets
neither
of
them
would
ever
know
alexander
chuckled
it
serves
you
right
he
crossed
his
legs
and
looked
up
at
kennon
standing
before
him
by
some
uncanny
legerdemain
he
had
gotten
control
of
himself
and
the
situation
at
the
same
time
being
telepathic
was
an
unfair
advantage
kennon
thought
you
were
equally
unfair
with
your
accusation
alexander
said
surehumanity
makes
mistakes
and
like
this
one
theyre
sometimes
brutal
mistakes
but
we
are
capable
of
atonement
morally
we
have
come
a
long
way
from
the
brutality
of
the
interregnum
i
shouldnt
have
to
use
examples
but
look
at
thathe
waved
at
the
view
wall
at
the
panorama
of
gleaming
fairy
towers
and
greenery
that
made
beta
city
one
of
the
most
beautiful
in
the
brotherhood
dont
tell
me
that
five
thousand
years
of
peace
and
development
havent
produced
civilization
thats
a
concrete
example
out
there
it
isnt
kennon
said
flatly
sure
its
prettycleanand
beautifully
designed
for
art
and
utilitybut
it
isnt
civilization
youre
confusing
technology
with
culture
you
look
at
this
and
say
what
a
great
civilization
man
has
built
when
you
really
mean
what
a
great
technology
mankind
has
developed
theres
all
the
difference
in
the
world
technology
is
of
the
mind
and
hands
civilization
is
of
the
spiritand
spiritually
we
are
still
in
the
dark
ages
we
conquer
kill
loot
and
enslave
we
establish
standards
to
keep
humanity
a
closed
corporation
a
special
club
in
which
men
can
live
but
aliens
cant
weve
made
the
standards
for
admission
so
rigid
that
we
even
enslave
our
own
kind
and
call
them
animals
thats
not
civilizationthats
savagery
for
nearly
five
hundred
years
your
family
has
run
a
slave
pen
your
fortune
is
based
upon
it
and
you
have
perpetuated
this
traffic
in
flesh
on
the
specious
reasoning
that
a
court
judgment
of
half
a
millennium
ago
is
as
good
today
as
when
it
was
handed
down
never
once
did
anyone
have
the
moral
courage
to
reexamine
that
old
decision
never
once
did
any
human
question
the
rightness
of
that
decision
none
of
us
are
immune
we
all
based
our
conduct
upon
an
antiquated
law
and
searched
no
further
everyone
was
happy
with
the
status
quoor
at
least
not
so
unhappy
that
they
wanted
to
change
it
even
i
would
have
been
content
had
it
not
been
for
copper
yet
i
do
not
feel
that
it
was
bad
that
i
hired
you
alexander
said
even
though
you
have
shown
me
that
i
am
a
slaver
and
made
me
see
faults
i
never
knew
i
had
his
face
was
drawnharsh
lines
reached
from
nose
to
lips
from
eyes
to
chin
suddenly
he
looked
old
i
can
accept
censure
if
censure
is
just
and
this
is
just
noim
not
sorry
i
hired
you
even
though
the
thought
of
what
i
have
helped
do
to
the
lani
makes
me
sick
to
my
stomach
well
kennon
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
dont
know
alexander
said
at
the
first
smell
of
trouble
the
family
will
turn
tail
and
run
you
can
break
the
company
and
i
wont
stand
in
your
way
its
only
just
youre
the
one
whos
carrying
the
ball
now
run
with
it
that
damned
blind
spot
kennon
said
you
realize
of
course
that
youre
not
legally
liable
it
was
a
mistake
all
you
have
to
do
is
admit
the
error
and
start
from
there
naturallyno
reasonable
intelligence
would
expect
that
you
change
the
older
lani
theyre
too
old
for
either
agerone
or
change
it
would
be
both
cruel
and
inhuman
to
turn
them
loose
its
with
the
youngsters
that
you
can
workthose
who
are
physically
and
physiologically
young
enough
to
derive
benefit
from
agerone
and
education
as
i
remember
you
bought
a
planet
called
phoebe
now
why
dont
you
phase
out
of
course
but
that
means
that
you
cant
press
charges
why
should
i
im
not
one
of
these
starryeyed
reformers
who
expect
to
change
things
overnight
its
the
future
of
the
lani
race
thats
important
and
brainard
agrees
with
me
a
phaseout
is
the
proper
solution
change
the
education
let
males
be
bornteach
the
young
to
think
instead
of
to
obey
give
them
phoebe
for
a
homethey
never
owned
all
of
kardon
anyway
and
within
a
century
or
two
we
will
have
a
new
group
of
the
human
raceand
then
we
can
tell
the
brotherhood
kennon
looked
inquiringly
at
copper
she
smiled
and
nodded
it
would
cause
less
trouble
that
way
she
said
it
would
be
more
sureand
there
are
never
too
many
old
ones
kennon
shuddered
thinking
of
the
euthanasia
chambers
on
otpen
one
there
will
be
more
from
now
on
he
said
outworld
can
afford
it
itll
bend
us
a
little
but
we
wont
breakand
besides
the
lani
will
need
our
help
for
some
time
to
come
alexander
looked
at
kennon
can
we
make
an
agreement
that
all
parties
will
respect
he
asked
i
think
soproviding
there
are
no
sleeper
clauses
in
it
kennon
said
there
wont
be
alexander
said
and
there
werent
it
was
a
private
ceremony
the
family
sulky
and
unwilling
faced
with
a
choice
of
drastically
reduced
income
or
outright
confiscation
and
preferring
a
portion
of
a
loaf
to
none
alexandergrim
but
oddly
peaceful
of
expression
brainardpinkcheeked
and
emotionless
kennon
and
copperhappily
conscious
that
it
was
at
last
finished
it
was
an
oddly
assorted
group
of
conspirators
who
planned
to
restore
a
segment
of
humanity
to
the
human
race
kennon
signed
last
and
as
he
did
alexander
looked
at
him
with
a
sly
grin
distorting
the
smooth
pallor
of
his
face
you
forgot
something
he
said
what
kennon
saidaware
suddenly
that
something
was
wrong
what
do
you
plan
to
do
now
that
this
is
over
join
the
medical
center
here
and
practice
veterinary
medicine
you
wouldnt
care
to
work
for
meto
help
rebuild
the
wreckage
youve
helped
create
ill
need
a
manager
on
kardon
to
phase
out
the
island
while
we
phase
in
phoebe
no
thank
you
ive
had
enough
of
that
you
just
think
you
have
alexander
said
gleefully
thats
what
you
have
forgotten
youve
gotten
your
agreementnow
you
will
satisfy
me
as
i
see
it
you
have
breached
your
contract
by
leaving
flora
without
authorization
that
is
right
kennon
said
a
small
lump
of
lead
began
to
grow
rapidly
larger
in
his
stomach
brainard
was
grinning
and
coppers
eyes
were
shining
youve
been
jobbed
his
mind
told
him
he
sighed
he
knew
what
was
coming
next
the
punitive
clause
for
breach
of
contract
alexander
went
on
inexorably
is
very
broad
discretion
is
vested
in
the
entrepreneur
i
can
obtain
judgment
against
you
in
any
court
on
any
planet
i
know
kennon
said
glumly
but
i
am
going
to
be
civilized
alexander
said
i
am
going
to
be
merciful
i
am
going
to
extend
your
contract
until
phaseout
has
been
completed
you
are
going
to
have
control
of
the
entire
kardon
phase
of
the
operation
its
poetic
justiceyou
made
the
messnow
you
can
clean
it
up
thats
inhuman
humanity
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
its
justice
alexander
said
he
smiled
at
coppers
radiant
face
the
thought
of
going
home
was
good
to
her
good
luck
on
your
new
job
dr
kennon
he
said
and
welcome
to
the
brotherhood
of
the
ulcer
