but
was
there
not
something
in

view
after
all
have
not
we
of
a
later
and
more
critical
day
got
into
so
inveterate
a
habit
of
digging
deep
that
we
sometimes
fail
to
see
what
lies
before
our
very
noses
modern
japan
is
there
to
furnish
an
example
the
japanese
are
it
is
true
commonly
said
to
be
an
irreligious
people
they
say
so
themselves
writes
one
of
them
the
celebrated
fukuzawa
teacher
and
type
of
the
modern
educated
japanese
man
i
lack
a
religious
nature
and
have
never
believed
in
any
religion
a
score
of
like
pronouncements
might
be
quoted
from
other
leading
men
the
average
even
educated
european
strikes
the
average
educated
japanese
as
strangely
superstitious
unaccountably
occupied
with
supramundane
matters
the
japanese
simply
cannot
be
brought
to
comprehend
how
a
mere
parson
such
as
the
pope
or
even
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
occupies
the
place
he
does
in
politics
and
society
yet
this
same
agnostic
japan
is
teaching
us
at
this
very
hour
how
religions
are
sometimes
manufactured
for
a
special
endto
subserve
practical
worldly
purposes
mikadoworship
and
japanworshipfor
that
is
the
new
japanese
religionis
of
course
no
spontaneously
generated
phenomenon
every
manufacture
presupposes
a
material
out
of
which
it
is
made
every
present
a
past
on
which
it
rests
but
the
twentiethcentury
japanese
religion
of
loyalty
and
patriotism
is
quite
new
for
in
it
preexisting
ideas
have
been
sifted
altered
freshly
compounded
turned
to
new
uses
and
have
found
a
new
centre
of
gravity
not
only
is
it
new
it
is
not
yet
completed
it
is
still
in
process
of
being
consciously
or
semiconsciously
put
together
by
the
official
class
in
order
to
serve
the
interests
of
that
class
and
incidentally
the
interests
of
the
nation
at
large
the
japanese
bureaucracy
is
a
body
greatly
to
be
admired
it
includes
most
of
the
foremost
men
of
the
nation
like
the
priesthood
in
later
judaea
to
some
extent
like
the
egyptian
and
indian
priesthoods
it
not
only
governs
but
aspires
to
lead
in
intellectual
matters
it
has
before
it
a
complex
task
on
the
one
hand
it
must
make
good
to
the
outer
world
the
new
claim
that
japan
differs
in
no
essential
way
from
the
nations
of
the
west
unless
indeed
it
be
by
way
of
superiority
on
the
other
hand
it
has
to
manage
restive
steeds
at
home
where
ancestral
ideas
and
habits
clash
with
new
dangers
arising
from
an
alien
material
civilisation
hastily
absorbed
down
to
the
year
the
line
of
cleavage
between
governors
and
governed
was
obscured
by
the
joyful
ardour
with
which
all
classes
alike
devoted
themselves
to
the
acquisition
of
european
not
to
say
american
ideas
everything
foreign
was
then
hailed
as
perfecteverything
old
and
national
was
contemned
sentiment
grew
democratic
in
so
far
perhaps
it
was
not
very
far
as
american
democratic
ideals
were
understood
love
of
country
seemed
likely
to
yield
to
a
humble
bowing
down
before
foreign
models
officialdom
not
unnaturally
took
fright
at
this
abdication
of
national
individualism
evidently
something
must
be
done
to
turn
the
tide
accordingly
patriotic
sentiment
was
appealed
to
through
the
throne
whose
hoary
antiquity
had
ever
been
a
source
of
pride
to
japanese
literati
who
loved
to
dwell
on
the
contrast
between
japans
unique
line
of
absolute
monarchs
and
the
shortlived
dynasties
of
china
shinto
a
primitive
nature
cult
which
had
fallen
into
discredit
was
taken
out
of
its
cupboard
and
dusted
the
common
people
it
is
true
continued
to
place
their
affections
on
buddhism
the
popular
festivals
were
buddhist
buddhist
also
the
temples
where
they
buried
their
dead
the
governing
class
determined
to
change
all
this
they
insisted
on
the
shinto
doctrine
that
the
mikado
descends
in
direct
succession
from
the
native
goddess
of
the
sun
and
that
he
himself
is
a
living
god
on
earth
who
justly
claims
the
absolute
fealty
of
his
subjects
such
things
as
laws
and
constitutions
are
but
free
gifts
on
his
part
not
in
any
sense
popular
rights
of
course
the
ministers
and
officials
high
and
low
who
carry
on
his
government
are
to
be
regarded
not
as
public
servants
but
rather
as
executants
of
supremeone
might
say
supernaturalauthority
shinto
because
connected
with
the
imperial
family
is
to
be
alone
honoured
therefore
the
important
right
of
burial
never
before
possessed
by
it
was
granted
to
its
priests
later
on
the
right
of
marriage
was
granted
likewisean
entirely
novel
departure
in
a
land
where
marriage
had
never
been
more
than
a
civil
contract
thus
the
shinto
priesthood
was
encouraged
to
penetrate
into
the
intimacy
of
family
life
while
in
another
direction
it
encroached
on
the
field
of
ethics
by
borrowing
bits
here
and
there
from
confucian
and
even
from
christian
sources
under
a
regime
of
ostensible
religious
toleration
the
attendance
of
officials
at
certain
shinto
services
was
required
and
the
practice
was
established
in
all
schools
of
bowing
down
several
times
yearly
before
the
emperors
picture
meanwhile
japanese
polities
had
prospered
her
warriors
had
gained
great
victories
enormous
was
the
prestige
thus
accruing
to
imperialism
and
to
the
rejuvenated
shinto
cult
all
military
successes
were
ascribed
to
the
miraculous
influence
of
the
emperors
virtue
and
to
the
virtues
of
his
imperial
and
divine
ancestorsthat
is
of
former
emperors
and
of
shinto
deities
imperial
envoys
were
regularly
sent
after
each
great
victory
to
carry
the
good
tidings
to
the
sun
goddess
at
her
great
shrine
at
ise
not
there
alone
but
at
the
other
principal
shinto
shrines
throughout
the
land
the
cannon
captured
from
chinese
or
russian
foes
were
officially
installed
with
a
view
to
identifying
imperialism
shinto
and
national
glory
in
the
popular
mind
the
new
legend
is
enforced
wherever
feasiblefor
instance
by
means
of
a
new
set
of
festivals
celebrating
imperial
official
events
but
the
schools
are
the
great
strongholds
of
the
new
propaganda
history
is
so
taught
to
the
young
as
to
focus
everything
upon
imperialism
and
to
diminish
as
far
as
possible
the
contrast
between
ancient
and
modern
conditions
the
same
is
true
of
the
instruction
given
to
army
and
navy
recruits
thus
though
shinto
is
put
in
the
forefront
little
stress
is
laid
on
its
mythology
which
would
be
apt
to
shock
even
the
japanese
mind
at
the
present
day
to
this
extent
where
a
purpose
useful
to
the
ruling
class
is
to
be
served
criticism
is
practised
though
not
avowedly
far
different
is
the
case
with
socalled
historical
facts
such
as
the
alleged
foundation
of
the
monarchy
in
bc
and
similar
statements
paralleled
only
for
absurdity
by
what
passed
for
history
in
mediaeval
europe
when
king
lear
brute
king
of
britain
etc
etc
were
accepted
as
authentic
personages
for
the
truth
known
to
all
critical
investigators
is
that
instead
of
going
back
to
a
remote
antiquity
the
origins
of
japanese
history
are
recent
as
compared
with
that
of
european
countries
the
first
glimmer
of
genuine
japanese
history
dates
from
the
fifth
century
after
christ
and
even
the
accounts
of
what
happened
in
the
sixth
century
must
be
received
with
caution
japanese
scholars
know
this
as
well
as
we
do
it
is
one
of
the
certain
results
of
investigation
but
the
japanese
bureaucracy
does
not
desire
to
have
the
light
let
in
on
this
inconvenient
circumstance
while
granting
a
dispensation
re
the
national
mythology
properly
so
called
it
exacts
belief
in
every
iota
of
the
national
historic
legends
woe
to
the
native
professor
who
strays
from
the
path
of
orthodoxy
his
wife
and
children
and
in
japan
every
man
however
young
has
a
wife
and
children
will
starve
from
the
late
prince
itos
grossly
misleading
commentary
on
the
japanese
constitution
down
to
school
compendiums
the
absurd
dates
are
everywhere
insisted
upon
this
despite
the
fact
that
the
mythology
and
the
socalled
early
history
are
recorded
in
the
same
works
and
are
characterised
by
like
miraculous
impossibilities
that
the
chronology
is
palpably
fraudulent
that
the
speeches
put
into
the
mouths
of
ancient
mikados
are
centos
culled
from
the
chinese
classics
that
their
names
are
in
some
cases
derived
from
chinese
sources
and
that
the
earliest
japanese
historical
narratives
the
earliest
known
social
usages
and
even
the
centralised
imperial
form
of
government
itself
are
all
stained
through
and
through
with
a
chinese
dye
so
much
so
that
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
determine
what
percentage
of
old
native
thought
may
still
linger
on
in
fragments
here
and
there
in
the
face
of
all
this
moral
ideals
which
were
of
common
knowledge
derived
from
the
teaching
of
the
chinese
sages
are
now
arbitrarily
referred
to
the
imperial
ancestors
such
in
particular
are
loyalty
and
filial
pietythe
two
virtues
on
which
in
the
fareastern
world
all
the
others
rest
it
is
furthermore
officially
taught
that
from
the
earliest
ages
perfect
concord
has
always
subsisted
in
japan
between
beneficent
sovereigns
on
the
one
hand
and
a
gratefully
loyal
people
on
the
other
never
it
is
alleged
has
japan
been
soiled
by
the
disobedient
and
rebellious
acts
common
in
other
countries
while
at
the
same
time
the
japanese
nation
sharing
to
some
extent
in
the
supernatural
virtues
of
its
rulers
has
been
distinguished
by
a
highminded
chivalry
called
bushido
unknown
in
inferior
lands
such
is
the
fabric
of
ideas
which
the
official
class
is
busy
building
up
by
every
means
in
its
power
including
the
punishment
of
those
who
presume
to
stickle
for
historic
truth
the
sober
fact
is
that
no
nation
probably
has
ever
treated
its
sovereigns
more
cavalierly
than
the
japanese
have
done
from
the
beginning
of
authentic
history
down
to
within
the
memory
of
living
men
emperors
have
been
deposed
emperors
have
been
assassinated
for
centuries
every
succession
to
the
throne
was
the
signal
for
intrigues
and
sanguinary
broils
emperors
have
been
exiled
some
have
been
murdered

which
he
had
been
relegated
one
managed
to
escape
hidden
under
a
load
of
dried
fish
in
the
fourteenth
century
things
came
to
such
a
pass
that
two
rival
imperial
lines
defied
each
other
for
the
space
of
fiftyeight
yearsthe
socalled
northern
and
southern
courts
and
it
was
the
northern
court
branded
by
later
historians
as
usurping
and
illegitimate
that
ultimately
won
the
day
and
handed
on
the
imperial
regalia
to
its
successors
after
that
as
indeed
before
that
for
long
centuries
the
government
was
in
the
hands
of
mayors
of
the
palace
who
substituted
one
infant
sovereign
for
another
generally
forcing
each
to
abdicate
as
soon
as
he
approached
mans
estate
at
one
period
these
mayors
of
the
palace
left
the
descendant
of
the
sun
in
such
distress
that
his
imperial
majesty
and
the
imperial
princes
were
obliged
to
gain
a
livelihood
by
selling
their
autographs
nor
did
any
great
party
in
the
state
protest
against
this
condition
of
affairs
even
in
the
present
reignthe
most
glorious
in
japanese
historythere
have
been
two
rebellions
during
one
of
which
a
rival
emperor
was
set
up
in
one
part
of
the
country
and
a
republic
proclaimed
in
another
as
for
bushido
so
modern
a
thing
is
it
that
neither
kaempfer
siebold
satow
nor
reinall
men
knowing
their
japan
by
heartever
once
allude
to
it
in
their
voluminous
writings
the
cause
of
their
silence
is
not
far
to
seek
bushido
was
unknown
until
a
decade
or
two
ago
the
very
word
appears
in
no
dictionary
native
or
foreign
before
the
year
chivalrous
individuals
of
course
existed
in
japan
as
in
all
countries
at
every
period
but
bushido
as
an
institution
or
a
code
of
rules
has
never
existed
the
accounts
given
of
it
have
been
fabricated
out
of
whole
cloth
chiefly
for
foreign
consumption
an
analysis
of
medieval
japanese
history
shows
that
the
great
feudal
houses
so
far
from
displaying
an
excessive
idealism
in
the
matter
of
fealty
to
one
emperor
one
lord
or
one
party
had
evolved
the
eminently
practical
plan
of
letting
their
different
members
take
different
sides
so
that
the
family
as
a
whole
might
come
out
as
winner
in
any
event
and
thus
avoid
the
confiscation
of
its
lands
cases
no
doubt
occurred
of
devotion
to
losing
causesfor
example
to
mikados
in
disgrace
but
they
were
less
common
than
in
the
more
romantic
west
thus
within
the
space
of
a
short
lifetime
the
new
japanese
religion
of
loyalty
and
patriotism
has
emerged
into
the
light
of
day
the
feats
accomplished
during
the
late
war
with
russia
show
that
the
simple
ideal
which
it
offers
is
capable
of
inspiring
great
deeds
from
a
certain
point
of
view
the
nation
may
be
congratulated
on
its
new
possession
the
new
japanese
religion
consists
in
its
present
early
stage
of
worship
of
the
sacrosanct
imperial
person
and
of
his
divine
ancestors
of
implicit
obedience
to
him
as
head
of
the
army
a
position
by
the
way
opposed
to
all
former
japanese
ideas
according
to
which
the
court
was
essentially
civilian
furthermore
of
a
corresponding
belief
that
japan
is
as
far
superior
to
the
common
ruck
of
nations
as
the
mikado
is
divinely
superior
to
the
common
ruck
of
kings
and
emperors
do
not
the
early
historybooks
record
the
fact
that
japan
was
created
first
while
all
other
countries
resulted
merely
from
the
drops
that
fell
from
the
creators
spear
when
he
had
finished
his
main
work
and
do
not
the
later
annals
prove
that
true
valour
belongs
to
the
japanese
knight
alone
whereas
foreign
countrieschina
and
europe
alikeare
sunk
in
a
degrading
commercialism
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
of
the
gods
to
take
any
notice
of
such
creatures
by
adopting
a
few
of
their
trifling
mechanical
inventions
is
an
act
of
gracious
condescension
to
quote
but
one
official
utterance
out
of
a
hundred
baron
oura
minister
of
agriculture
and
commerce
writes
thus
in
february
of
last
year
that
the
majesty
of
our
imperial
house
towers
high
above
everything
to
be
found
in
the
world
and
that
it
is
as
durable
as
heaven
and
earth
is
too
well
known
to
need
dwelling
on
here
if
it
is
considered
that
our
country
needs
a
religious
faith
then
i
say
let
it
be
converted
to
a
belief
in
the
religion
of
patriotism
and
loyalty
the
religion
of
imperialismin
other
words
to

the
rev
dr
ebina
one
of
the
leading
lights
of
the
protestant
pastorate
in
japan
plunges
more
deeply
still
into
this
doctrine
according
to
which
as
already
noted
the
whole
japanese
nation
is
in
a
manner
apotheosised
says
he
though
the
encouragement
of
ancestorworship
cannot
be
regarded
as
part
of
the
essential
teaching
of
christianity
it
is
not
opposed
to
the
notion
that
when
the
japanese
empire
was
founded
its
early
rulers
were
in
communication
with
the
great
spirit
that
rules
the
universe
christians
according
to
this
theory
without
doing
violence
to
their
creed
may
acknowledge
that
the
japanese
nation
has
a
divine
origin
it
is
only
when
we
realise
that
the
imperial
ancestors
were
in
close
communion
with
god
or
the
gods
that
we
understand
how
sacred
is
the
country
in
which
we
live

ends
by
recommending
the

no
comment

ours
to
point
out
how
thoroughly
the

must
be
saturated
by
the

such
amazing

new

all
the
more
ardent
spirits
the
peasantry
as
before
noted
occupy
themselves
little
with
new
thoughts
clinging
rather
to
the
buddhist
beliefs
of
their
forefathers
but
nothing
could
be
further
removed
from
even
their
minds
than
the
idea
of
offering
any
organised
resistance
to
the
propaganda
going
on
around
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
spread
of
the
new
ideas
has
been
easy
because
a
large
class
derives
power
from
their
diffusion
while
to
oppose
them
is
the
business
of
no
one
in
particular
moreover
the
disinterested
love
of
truth
for
its
own
sake
is
rare
the
patience
to
unearth
it
is
rarer
still
especially
in
the
east
patriotism
too
is
a
mighty
engine
working
in
the
interests
of
credulity
how
should
men
not
believe
in
a
system
that
produces
such
excellent
practical
results
a
system
which
has
united
all
the
scattered
elements
of
national
feeling
into
one
focus
and
has
thus
created
a
powerful
instrument
for
the
attainment
of
national
aims
meanwhile
a
generation
is
growing
up
which
does
not
so
much
as
suspect
that
its
cherished
beliefs
are
inventions
of
yesterday
the
new
religion
in
its
present
stage
still
lacks
one
important
itema
sacred
book
certain
indications
show
that
this
lacuna
will
be
filled
by
the
elevation
of
the
more
important
imperial
rescripts
to
that
rank
accompanied
doubtless
by
an
authoritative
commentary
as
their
style
is
too
abstruse
to
be
understanded
of
the
people
to
these
imperial
rescripts
some
of
the
poems
composed
by
his
present
majesty
may
be
added
in
fact
a
volume
on
the
whole
duty
of
japanese
man
with
selected
imperial
poems
as

has
already
appeared
note
for
over
a
thousand
years
the
composition
of
japanese
and
chinese
verse
has
formed
part
of
a
liberal
education
like
the
composition
of
latin
verse
among
ourselves
the
court
has
always
devoted
much
time
to
the
practice
of
this
art
but
the
poems
of
former
emperors
were
little
known
because
the
monarchs
themselves
remained
shut
up
in
their
palace
and
exercised
no
influence
beyond
its
walls
with
his
present
majesty
the
case
is
entirely
different
moreover
some
of
his
compositions
breathe
a
patriotism
formerly
undreamt
of

might
have
imagined
that
japans
new

would
have
experienced
some

the

that
whereas

know

that
it
imports
them
to
know
about

europeans
cannot
know

about

such

does
it
come
about
that
the

astonishing
national

already
begin

the

willed

so

in

the

the
statement
may
sound
paradoxical
study
the

carefully
and
you
will
find
that
it
is
simply
true
what
is
happening
in

today
is
evidently
exceptional
normal
religious
and

not

in

manner
it
proceeds
by

degrees

exceptions
to
general
rules
occur
from

to
time
in
every
field
of
activity
are
they
really
exceptions
using
that
term
in
its
current
senseto
denote
something
arbitrary
and
therefore
unaccountable
surely
these
socalled
exceptions
are
but
examples
of
rules
of
rarer
application
the
classic
instance
of
the
invention
of
a
new
national
religion
is
furnished
by
the
jews
of
the
postexilic
period
the
piecing
together
then
of
a
brandnew
system
under
an
ancient
name
is
now
so
well
understood
and
has
produced
consequences
of
such
worldwide
importance
that
the
briefest
reference
to
it
may
suffice

so
far
as
is

no
one
in

ever
saw
through
the

rousseau

extraordinary

aspiration
of

simpler
juster
more
true

more
logical
he
gave
exactly
what
was
needed
at
that
moment
of

appeared
selfevident
wherefore
no
one
so
much
as
thought
of
asking
for
detailed
proofs
his
deism
his
statements
concerning
the
state
of
nature
and
the
social
contract
etc
were
at
once
recognised
by
the
people
of
his
day
as
eternal
verities
what
need
for
discussion
or
investigation
the
case
of
judaea
is
obscure
but
it
would
seem
that
something
analogous
must
have
happened
there
when
the
continuity
of
national
life
had
been
snapped
by
the
exile
a
revolutionised
and
most
unhappy
present
involved
a
changed
attitude
towards
the
past
oral
tradition

the
scraps
of

that

of

the
kaleidoscope

turned
the
pattern
changed
of
itself
a

individuals
voiced
the

of
a

when
they
adopted
literary
methods
which
would

be
branded
as

they
simply
could

with
all
the
illiberal
and
obscurantist
measures
which
it
entails
that
is
natural
we
modern

love

liberty
and
the

love
to

the

into

freedom

our

acts
quite
