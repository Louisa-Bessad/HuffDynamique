my
lord
i
beg
leave
to
dedicate
this
volume
to
your
lordship
as
a
tribute
justly
due
to
the
great
statesman
who
has
ever
had
at
heart
the
amelioration
of
the
african
race
and
as
a
token
of
admiration
of
the
beneficial
effects
of
that
policy
which
he
has
so
long
laboured
to
establish
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
and
which
in
improving
that
region
has
most
forcibly
shown
the
need
of
some
similar
system
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
continent
david
livingstone
notice
to
this
work
the
name
of
the
late
mr
charles
livingstone
takes
a
prominent
place
amongst
those
who
acted
under
the
leadership
of
dr
livingstone
during
the
adventurous
sojourn
of
the
zambesi
expedition
in
east
africa
in
laying
the
result
of
their
discoveries
before
the
public
it
was
arranged
that
mr
charles
livingstone
should
place
his
voluminous
notes
at
the
disposal
of
his
brother
they
are
incorporated
in
the
present
work
but
in
a
necessarily
abridged
form
preface
it
has
been
my
object
in
this
work
to
give
as
clear
an
account
as
i
was
able
of
tracts
of
country
previously
unexplored
with
their
river
systems
natural
productions
and
capabilities
and
to
bring
before
my
countrymen
and
all
others
interested
in
the
cause
of
humanity
the
misery
entailed
by
the
slavetrade
in
its
inland
phases
a
subject
on
which
i
and
my
companions
are
the
first
who
have
had
any
opportunities
of
forming
a
judgment
the
eight
years
spent
in
africa
since
my
last
work
was
published
have
not
i
fear
improved
my
power
of
writing
english
but
i
hope
that
whatever
my
descriptions
want
in
clearness
or
literary
skill
may
in
a
measure
be
compensated
by
the
novelty
of
the
scenes
described
and
the
additional
information
afforded
on
that
curse
of
africa
and
that
shame
even
now
in
the
th
century
of
an
european
nationthe
slavetrade
i
took
the
lady
nyassa
to
bombay
for
the
express
purpose
of
selling
her
and
might
without
any
difficulty
have
done
so
but
with
the
thought
of
parting
with
her
arose
more
strongly
than
ever
the
feeling
of
disinclination
to
abandon
the
east
coast
of
africa
to
the
portuguese
and
slavetrading
and
i
determined
to
run
home
and
consult
my
friends
before
i
allowed
the
little
vessel
to
pass
from
my
hands
after
therefore
having
put
two
ajawa
lads
chuma
and
wakatani
to
school
under
the
eminent
missionary
the
rev
dr
wilson
and
having
provided
satisfactorily
for
the
native
crew
i
started
homewards
with
the
three
white
sailors
and
reached
london
july
th
mr
and
mrs
webb
my
muchloved
friends
wrote
to
bombay
inviting
me
in
the
event
of
my
coming
to
england
to
make
newstead
abbey
my
headquarters
and
on
my
arrival
renewed
their
invitation
and
though
when
i
accepted
it
i
had
no
intention
of
remaining
so
long
with
my
kindhearted
generous
friends
i
stayed
with
them
until
april
and
under
their
roof
transcribed
from
my
own
and
my
brothers
journal
the
whole
of
this
present
book
it
is
with
heartfelt
gratitude
i
would
record
their
unwearied
kindness
my
acquaintance
with
mr
webb
began
in
africa
where
he
was
a
daring
and
successful
hunter
and
his
continued
friendship
is
most
valuable
because
he
has
seen
missionary
work
and
he
would
not
accord
his
respect
and
esteem
to
me
had
he
not
believed
that
i
and
my
brethren
also
were
to
be
looked
on
as
honest
men
earnestly
trying
to
do
our
duty
the
government
have
supported
the
proposal
of
the
royal
geographical
society
made
by
my
friend
sir
roderick
murchison
and
have
united
with
that
body
to
aid
me
in
another
attempt
to
open
africa
to
civilizing
influences
and
a
valued
private
friend
has
given
a
thousand
pounds
for
the
same
object
i
propose
to
go
inland
north
of
the
territory
which
the
portuguese
in
europe
claim
and
endeavour
to
commence
that
system
on
the
east
which
has
been
so
eminently
successful
on
the
west
coast
a
system
combining
the
repressive
efforts
of
hm
cruisers
with
lawful
trade
and
christian
missionsthe
moral
and
material
results
of
which
have
been
so
gratifying
i
hope
to
ascend
the
rovuma
or
some
other
river
north
of
cape
delgado
and
in
addition
to
my
other
work
shall
strive
by
passing
along
the
northern
end
of
lake
nyassa
and
round
the
southern
end
of
lake
tanganyika
to
ascertain
the
watershed
of
that
part
of
africa
in
so
doing
i
have
no
wish
to
unsettle
what
with
so
much
toil
and
danger
was
accomplished
by
speke
and
grant
but
rather
to
confirm
their
illustrious
discoveries
i
have
to
acknowledge
the
obliging
readiness
of
lord
russell
in
lending
me
the
drawings
taken
by
the
artist
who
was
in
the
first
instance
attached
to
the
expedition
these
sketches
with
photographs
by
charles
livingstone
and
dr
kirk
have
materially
assisted
in
the
illustrations
i
would
also
very
sincerely
thank
my
friends
professor
owen
and
mr
oswell
for
many
valuable
hints
and
other
aid

by

authoritiesmembers
of
the
zambesi
expedition
when
first
i
determined
on
publishing
the
narrative
of
my
missionary
travels
i
had
a
great
misgiving
as
to
whether
the
criticism
my
endeavours
might
provoke
would
be
friendly
or
the
reverse
more
particularly
as
i
felt
that
i
had
then
been
so
long
a
sojourner
in
the
wilderness
as
to
be
quite
a
stranger
to
the
british
public
but
i
am
now
in
this
my
second
essay
at
authorship
cheered
by
the
conviction
that
very
many
readers
who
are
personally
unknown
to
me
will
receive
this
narrative
with
the
kindly
consideration
and
allowances
of
friends
and
that
many
more
under
the
genial
influences
of
an
innate
love
of
liberty
and
of
a
desire
to
see
the
same
social
and
religious
blessings
they
themselves
enjoy
disseminated
throughout
the
world
will
sympathize
with
me
in
the
efforts
by
which
i
have
striven
however
imperfectly
to
elevate
the
position
and
character
of
our
fellowmen
in
africa
this
knowledge
makes
me
doubly
anxious
to
render
my
narrative
acceptable
to
all
my
readers
but
in
the
absence
of
any
excellence
in
literary
composition
the
natural
consequence
of
my
pursuits
i
have
to
offer
only
a
simple
account
of
a
mission
which
with
respect
to
the
objects
proposed
to
be
thereby
accomplished
formed
a
noble
contrast
to
some
of
the
earlier
expeditions
to
eastern
africa
i
believe
that
the
information
it
will
give
respecting
the
people
visited
and
the
countries
traversed
will
not
be
materially
gainsaid
by
any
future
commonplace
traveller
like
myself
who
may
be
blest
with
fair
health
and
a
gleam
of
sunshine
in
his
breast
this
account
is
written
in
the
earnest
hope
that
it
may
contribute
to
that
information
which
will
yet
cause
the
great
and
fertile
continent
of
africa
to
be
no
longer
kept
wantonly
sealed
but
made
available
as
the
scene
of
european
enterprise
and
will
enable
its
people
to
take
a
place
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
thus
securing
the
happiness
and
prosperity
of
tribes
now
sunk
in
barbarism
or
debased
by
slavery
and
above
all
i
cherish
the
hope
that
it
may
lead
to
the
introduction
of
the
blessings
of
the
gospel
in
order
that
the
following
narrative
may
be
clearly
understood
it
is
necessary
to
call
to
mind
some
things
which
took
place
previous
to
the
zambesi
expedition
being
sent
out
most
geographers
are
aware
that
before
the
discovery
of
lake
ngami
and
the
wellwatered
country
in
which
the
makololo
dwell
the
idea
prevailed
that
a
large
part
of
the
interior
of
africa
consisted
of
sandy
deserts
into
which
rivers
ran
and
were
lost
during
my
journey
in
from
sea
to
sea
across
the
south
intertropical
part
of
the
continent
it
was
found
to
be
a
wellwatered
country
with
large
tracts
of
fine
fertile
soil
covered
with
forest
and
beautiful
grassy
valleys
occupied
by
a
considerable
population
and
one
of
the
most
wonderful
waterfalls
in
the
world
was
brought
to
light
the
peculiar
form
of
the
continent
was
then
ascertained
to
be
an
elevated
plateau
somewhat
depressed
in
the
centre
and
with
fissures
in
the
sides
by
which
the
rivers
escaped
to
the
sea
and
this
great
fact
in
physical
geography
can
never
be
referred
to
without
calling
to
mind
the
remarkable
hypothesis
by
which
the
distinguished
president
of
the
royal
geographical
society
sir
roderick
i
murchison
clearly
indicated
this
peculiarity
before
it
was
verified
by
actual
observation
of
the
altitudes
of
the
country
and
by
the
courses
of
the
rivers
new
light
was
thrown
on
other
portions
of
the
continent
by
the
famous
travels
of
dr
barth
by
the
researches
of
the
church
of
england
missionaries
krapf
erkhardt
and
rebman
by
the
persevering
efforts
of
dr
baikie
the
last
martyr
to
the
climate
and
english
enterprise
by
the
journey
of
francis
galton
and
by
the
most
interesting
discoveries
of
lakes
tanganyika
and
victoria
nyanza
by
captain
burton
and
by
captain
speke
whose
untimely
end
we
all
so
deeply
deplore
then
followed
the
researches
of
van
der
decken
thornton
and
others
and
last
of
all
the
grand
discovery
of
the
main
source
of
the
nile
which
every
englishman
must
feel
an
honest
pride
in
knowing
was
accomplished
by
our
gallant
countrymen
speke
and
grant
the
fabulous
torrid
zone
of
parched
and
burning
sand
was
now
proved
to
be
a
wellwatered
region
resembling
north
america
in
its
freshwater
lakes
and
india
in
its
hot
humid
lowlands
jungles
ghauts
and
cool
highland
plains
the
main
object
of
this
zambesi
expedition
as
our
instructions
from
her
majestys
government
explicitly
stated
was
to
extend
the
knowledge
already
attained
of
the
geography
and
mineral
and
agricultural
resources
of
eastern
and
central
africato
improve
our
acquaintance
with
the
inhabitants
and
to
endeavour
to
engage
them
to
apply
themselves
to
industrial
pursuits
and
to
the
cultivation
of
their
lands
with
a
view
to
the
production
of
raw
material
to
be
exported
to
england
in
return
for
british
manufactures
and
it
was
hoped
that
by
encouraging
the
natives
to
occupy
themselves
in
the
development
of
the
resources
of
the
country
a
considerable
advance
might
be
made
towards
the
extinction
of
the
slave
trade
as
they
would
not
be
long
in
discovering
that
the
former
would
eventually
be
a
more
certain
source
of
profit
than
the
latter
the
expedition
was
sent
in
accordance
with
the
settled
policy
of
the
english
government
and
the
earl
of
clarendon
being
then
at
the
head
of
the
foreign
office
the
mission
was
organized
under
his
immediate
care
when
a
change
of
government
ensued
we
experienced
the
same
generous
countenance
and
sympathy
from
the
earl
of
malmesbury
as
we
had
previously
received
from
lord
clarendon
and
on
the
accession
of
earl
russell
to
the
high
office
he
has
so
long
filled
we
were
always
favoured
with
equally
ready
attention
and
the
same
prompt
assistance
thus
the
conviction
was
produced
that
our
work
embodied
the
principles
not
of
any
one
party
but
of
the
hearts
of
the
statesmen
and
of
the
people
of
england
generally
the
expedition
owes
great
obligations
to
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
for
their
unvarying
readiness
to
render
us
every
assistance
in
their
power
and
to
the
warmhearted
and
everobliging
hydrographer
to
the
admiralty
the
late
admiral
washington
as
a
subordinate
but
most
effective
agent
our
heartfelt
gratitude
is
also
due
and
we
must
ever
thankfully
acknowledge
that
our
efficiency
was
mainly
due
to
the
kind
services
of
admirals
sir
frederick
grey
sir
baldwin
walker
and
all
the
naval
officers
serving
under
them
on
the
east
coast
nor
must
i
omit
to
record
our
obligations
to
mr
skead
rn
the
luawe
was
carefully
sounded
and
surveyed
by
this
officer
whose
skilful
and
zealous
labours
both
on
that
river
and
afterwards
on
the
lower
zambesi
were
deserving
of
all
praise
in
speaking
of
what
has
been
done
by
the
expedition
it
should
always
be
understood
that
dr
kirk
mr
charles
livingstone
mr
r
thornton
and
others
composed
it
in
using
the
plural
number
they
are
meant
and
i
wish
to
bear
testimony
to
the
untiring
zeal
energy
courage
and
perseverance
with
which
my
companions
laboured
undaunted
by
difficulties
dangers
or
hard
fare
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
were
their
services
required
in
any
other
capacity
they
might
be
implicitly
relied
on
to
perform
their
duty
like
men
the
reason
why
dr
kirks
name
does
not
appear
on
the
titlepage
of
this
narrative
is
because
it
is
hoped
that
he
may
give
an
account
of
the
botany
and
natural
history
of
the
expedition
in
a
separate
work
from
his
own
pen
he
collected
above
four
thousand
species
of
plants
specimens
of
most
of
the
valuable
woods
of
the
different
native
manufactures
of
the
articles
of
food
and
of
the
different
kinds
of
cotton
from
every
spot
we
visited
and
a
great
variety
of
birds
and
insects
besides
making
meteorological
observations
and
affording
as
our
instructions
required
medical
assistance
to
the
natives
in
every
case
where
he
could
be
of
any
use
charles
livingstone
was
also
fully
occupied
in
his
duties
in
following
out
the
general
objects
of
our
mission
in
encouraging
the
culture
of
cotton
in
making
many
magnetic
and
meteorological
observations
in
photographing
so
long
as
the
materials
would
serve
and
in
collecting
a
large
number
of
birds
insects
and
other
objects
of
interest
the
collections
being
government
property
have
been
forwarded
to
the
british
museum
and
to
the
royal
botanic
gardens
at
kew
and
should
dr
kirk
undertake
their
description
three
or
four
years
will
be
required
for
the
purpose
though
collections
were
made
it
was
always
distinctly
understood
that
however
desirable
these
and
our
explorations
might
be
her
majestys
government
attached
more
importance
to
the
moral
influence
that
might
be
exerted
on
the
minds
of
the
natives
by
a
wellregulated
and
orderly
household
of
europeans
setting
an
example
of
consistent
moral
conduct
to
all
who
might
witness
it
treating
the
people
with
kindness
and
relieving
their
wants
teaching
them
to
make
experiments
in
agriculture
explaining
to
them
the
more
simple
arts
imparting
to
them
religious
instruction
as
far
as
they
are
capable
of
receiving
it
and
inculcating
peace
and
good
will
to
each
other
it
would
be
tiresome
to
enumerate
in
detail
all
the
little
acts
which
were
performed
by
us
while
following
out
our
instructions
as
a
rule
whenever
the
steamer
stopped
to
take
in
wood
or
for
any
other
purpose
dr
kirk
and
charles
livingstone
went
ashore
to
their
duties
one
of
our
party
who
it
was
intended
should
navigate
the
vessel
and
lay
down
the
geographical
positions
having
failed
to
answer
the
expectations
formed
of
him
these
duties
fell
chiefly
to
my
share
they
involved
a
considerable
amount
of
night
work
in
which
i
was
always
cheerfully
aided
by
my
companions
and
the
results
were
regularly
communicated
to
our
warm
and
everready
friend
sir
thomas
maclear
of
the
royal
observatory
cape
of
good
hope
while
this
work
was
going
through
the
press
we
were
favoured
with
the
longitudes
of
several
stations
determined
from
observed
occultations
of
stars
by
the
moon
and
from
eclipses
and
reappearances
of
jupiters

by
mr
mann
the
able
assistant
to
the
cape
astronomer
royal
the
lunars
are
still
in
the
hands
of
mr
g
w
h
maclear
of
the
same
observatory
in
addition
to
these
the
altitudes
variations
of
the
compass
latitudes
and
longitudes
as
calculated
on
the
spot
appear
in
the
map
by
mr
arrowsmith
and
it
is
hoped
may
not
differ
much
from
the
results
of
the
same
data
in
abler
bands
the
office
of
skipper
which
rather
than
let
the
expedition
come
to
a
stand
i
undertook
required
no
great
ability
in
one
not
too
old
to
learn
it
saved
a
salary
and
what
was
much
more
valuable
than
gold
saved
the
expedition
from
the
drawback
of
any
one
thinking
that
he
was
indispensable
to
its
further
progress
the
office
required
attention
to
the
vessel
both
at
rest
and
in
motion
it
also
involved
considerable
exposure
to
the
sun
and
to
my
regret
kept
me
from
much
anticipated
intercourse
with
the
natives
and
the
formation
of
full
vocabularies
of
their
dialects
i
may
add
that
all
wearisome
repetitions
are
as
much
as
possible
avoided
in
the
narrative
and
our
movements
and
operations
having
previously
been
given
in
a
series
of
despatches
the
attempt
is
now
made
to
give
as
fairly
as
possible
just
what
would
most
strike
any
person
of
ordinary
intelligence
in
passing
through
the
country
for
the
sake
of
the
freshness
which
usually
attaches
to
first
impressions
the
journal
of
charles
livingstone
has
been
incorporated
in
the
narrative
and
many
remarks
made
by
the
natives
which
ho
put
down
at
the
moment
of
translation
will
convey
to
others
the
same
ideas
as
they
did
to
ourselves
some
are
no
doubt
trivial
but
it
is
by
the
little
acts
and
words
of
everyday
life
that
character
is
truly
and
best
known
and
doubtless
many
will
prefer
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
from
them
rather
than
to
be
schooled

the
expedition
left
england
on
the
th
of
march
in
her
majestys
colonial
steamer
pearl
commanded
by
captain
duncan
and
after
enjoying
the
generous
hospitality
of
our
friends
at
cape
town
with
the
obliging
attentions
of
sir
george
grey
and
receiving
on
board
mr
francis
skead
rn
as
surveyor
we
reached
the
east
coast
in
the
following
may
our
first
object
was
to
explore
the
zambesi
its
mouths
and
tributaries
with
a
view
to
their
being
used
as
highways
for
commerce
and
christianity
to
pass
into
the
vast
interior
of
africa
when
we
came
within
five
or
six
miles
of
the
land
the
yellowishgreen
tinge
of
the
sea
in
soundings
was
suddenly
succeeded
by
muddy
water
with
wrack
as
of
a
river
in
flood
the
two
colours
did
not
intermingle
but
the
line
of
contact
was
as
sharply
defined
as
when
the
ocean
meets
the
land
it
was
observed
that
under
the
wrackconsisting
of
reeds
sticks
and
leavesand
even
under
floating
cuttlefish
bones
and
portuguese
menofwar
physalia
numbers
of
small
fish
screen
themselves
from
the
eyes
of
birds
of
prey
and
from
the
rays
of
the
torrid
sun
we
entered
the
river
luawe
first
because
its
entrance
is
so
smooth
and
deep
that
the
pearl
drawing
feet
inches
went
in
without
a
boat
sounding
ahead
a
small
steam
launch
having
been
brought
out
from
england
in
three
sections
on
the
deck
of
the
pearl
was
hoisted
out
and
screwed
together
at
the
anchorage
and
with
her
aid
the
exploration
was
commenced
she
was
called
the
ma
robert
after
mrs
livingstone
to
whom
the
natives
according
to
their
custom
gave
the
name
ma
mother
of
her
eldest
son
the
harbour
is
deep
but
shut
in
by
mangrove
swamps
and
though
the
water
a
few
miles
up
is
fresh
it
is
only
a
tidal
river
for
after
ascending
some
seventy
miles
it
was
found
to
end
in
marshes
blocked
up
with
reeds
and
succulent
aquatic
plants
as
the
luawe
had
been
called
west
luabo
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
branch
of
the
zambesi
the
main
stream
of
which
is
called
luabo
or
east
luabo
the
ma
robert
and
pearl
then
went
to
what
proved
to
be
a
real
mouth
of
the
river
we
sought
the
zambesi
pours
its
waters
into
the
ocean
by
four
mouths
namely
the
milambe
which
is
the
most
westerly
the
kongone
the
luabo
and
the
timbwe
or
muselo
when
the
river
is
in
flood
a
natural
canal
running
parallel
with
the
coast
and
winding
very
much
among
the
swamps
forms
a
secret
way
for
conveying
slaves
from
quillimane
to
the
bays
massangano
and
nameara
or
to
the
zambesi
itself
the
kwakwa
or
river
of
quillimane
some
sixty
miles
distant
from
the
mouth
of
the
zambesi
has
long
been
represented
as
the
principal
entrance
to
the
zambesi
in
order
as
the
portuguese
now
maintain
that
the
english
cruisers
might
be
induced
to
watch
the
false
mouth
while
slaves
were
quietly
shipped
from
the
true
one
and
strange
to
say
this
error
has
lately
been
propagated
by
a
map
issued
by
the
colonial
minister
of
portugal
after
the
examination
of
three
branches
by
the
able
and
energetic
surveyor
francis
skead
rn
the
kongone
was
found
to
be
the
best
entrance
the
immense
amount
of
sand
brought
down
by
the
zambesi
has
in
the
course
of
ages
formed
a
sort
of
promontory
against
which
the
long
swell
of
the
indian
ocean
beating
during
the
prevailing
winds
has
formed
bars
which
acting
against
the
waters
of
the
delta
may
have
led
to
their
exit
sideways
the
kongone
is
one
of
those
lateral
branches
and
the
safest
inasmuch
as
the
bar
has
nearly
two
fathoms
on
it
at
low
water
and
the
rise
at
spring
tides
is
from
twelve
to
fourteen
feet
the
bar
is
narrow
the
passage
nearly
straight
and
were
it
buoyed
and
a
beacon
placed
on
pearl
island
would
always
be
safe
to
a
steamer
when
the
wind
is
from
the
east
or
north
the
bar
is
smooth
if
from
the
south
and
southeast
it
has
a
heavy
break
on
it
and
is
not
to
be
attempted
in
boats
a
strong
current
setting
to
the
east
when
the
tide
is
flowing
and
to
the
west
when
ebbing
may
drag
a
boat
or
ship
into
the
breakers
if
one
is
doubtful
of
his
longitude
and
runs
east
he
will
soon
see
the
land
at
timbwe
disappear
away
to
the
north
and
coming
west
again
he
can
easily
make
out
east
luabo
from
its
great
size
and
kongone
follows
several
miles
west
east
luabo
has
a
good
but
long
bar
and
not
to
be
attempted
unless
the
wind
be
northeast
or
east
it
has
sometimes
been
called
barra
catrina
and
was
used
in
the
embarkations
of
slaves
this
may
have
been
the
river
of
good
signs
of
vasco
da
gama
as
the
mouth
is
more
easily
seen
from
the
seaward
than
any
other
but
the
absence
of
the
pillar
dedicated
by
that
navigator
to
st
raphael
leaves
the
matter
in
doubt
no
portuguese
live
within
eighty
miles
of
any
mouth
of
the
zambesi
the
kongone
is
five
miles
east
of
the
milambe
or
western
branch
and
seven
miles
west
from
east
luabo
which
again
is
five
miles
from
the
timbwe
we
saw
but
few
natives
and
these
by
escaping
from
their
canoes
into
the
mangrove
thickets
the
moment
they
caught
sight
of
us
gave
unmistakeable
indications
that
they
had
no
very
favourable
opinion
of
white
men
they
were
probably
fugitives
from
portuguese
slavery
in
the
grassy
glades
buffaloes
warthogs
and
three
kinds
of
antelope
were
abundant
and
the
latter
easily
obtained
a
few
hours
hunting
usually
provided
venison
enough
for
a
score
of
men
for
several
days
on
proceeding
up
the
kongone
branch
it
was
found
that
by
keeping
well
in
the
bends
which
the
current
had
worn
deep
shoals
were
easily
avoided
the
first
twenty
miles
are
straight
and
deep
then
a
small
and
rather
tortuous
natural
canal
leads
off
to
the
right
and
after
about
five
miles
during
which
the
paddles
almost
touch
the
floating
grass
of
the
sides
ends
in
the
broad
zambesi
the
rest
of
the
kongone
branch
comes
out
of
the
main
stream
considerably
higher
up
as
the
outgoing
branch
called
doto
the
first
twenty
miles
of
the
kongone
are
enclosed
in
mangrove
jungle
some
of
the
trees
are
ornamented
with
orchilla
weed
which
appears
never
to
have
been
gathered
huge
ferns
palm
bushes
and
occasionally
wild
datepalms
peer
out
in
the
forest
which
consists
of
different
species
of
mangroves
the
bunches
of
bright
yellow
though
scarcely
edible
fruit
contrasting
prettily
with
the
graceful
green
leaves
in
some
spots
the
milola
an
umbrageous
hibiscus
with
large
yellowish
flowers
grows
in
masses
along
the
bank
its
bark
is
made
into
cordage
and
is
especially
valuable
for
the
manufacture
of
ropes
attached
to
harpoons
for
killing
the
hippopotamus
the
pandanus
or
screwpalm
from
which
sugar
bags
are
made
in
the
mauritius
also
appears
and
on
coming
out
of
the
canal
into
the
zambesi
many
are
so
tall
as
in
the
distance
to
remind
us
of
the
steeples
of
our
native
land
and
make
us
relish
the
remark
of
an
old
sailor
that
but
one
thing
was
wanting
to
complete
the
picture
and
that
was
a
grogshop
near
the
church
we
find
also
a
few
guava
and
lime
trees
growing
wild
but
the
natives
claim
the
crops
the
dark
woods
resound
with
the
lively
and
exultant
song
of
the
kinghunter
halcyon
striolata
as
he
sits
perched
on
high
among
the
trees
as
the
steamer
moves
on
through
the
winding
channel
a
pretty
little
heron
or
bright
kingfisher
darts
out
in
alarm
from
the
edge
of
the
bank
flies
on
ahead
a
short
distance
and
settles
quietly
down
to
be
again
frightened
off
in
a
few
seconds
as
we
approach
the
magnificent
fishhawk
halietus
vocifer
sits
on
the
top
of
a
mangrovetree
digesting
his
morning
meal
of
fresh
fish
and
is
clearly
unwilling
to
stir
until
the
imminence
of
the
danger
compels
him
at
last
to
spread
his
great
wings
for
flight
the
glossy
ibis
acute
of
ear
to
a
remarkable
degree
hears
from
afar
the
unwonted
sound
of
the
paddles
and
springing
from
the
mud
where
his
family
has
been
quietly
feasting
is
off
screaming
out
his
loud
harsh
and
defiant
ha
ha
ha
long
before
the
danger
is
near
several
native
huts
now
peep
out
from
the
bananas
and
cocoapalms
on
the
right
bank
they
stand
on
piles
a
few
feet
above
the
low
damp
ground
and
their
owners
enter
them
by
means
of
ladders
the
soil
is
wonderfully
rich
and
the
gardens
are
really
excellent
rice
is
cultivated
largely
sweet
potatoes
pumpkins
tomatoes
cabbages
onions
shalots
peas
a
little
cotton
and
sugarcane
are
also
raised
it
is
said
that
english
potatoes
when
planted
at
quillimane
on
soil
resembling
this
in
the
course
of
two
years
become
in
taste
like
sweet
potatoes
convolvulus
batatas
and
are
like
our
potato
frosted
the
whole
of
the
fertile
region
extending
from
the
kongone
canal
to
beyond
mazaro
some
eighty
miles
in
length
and
fifty
in
breadth
is
admirably
adapted
for
the
growth
of
sugarcane
and
were
it
in
the
hands
of
our
friends
at
the
cape
would
supply
all
europe
with
sugar
the
remarkably
few
people
seen
appear
to
be
tolerably
well
fed
but
there
was
a
dearth
of
clothing
among
them
all
were
blacks
and
nearly
all
portuguese
colonos
or
serfs
they
manifested
no
fear
of
white
men
and
stood
in
groups
on
the
bank
gazing
in
astonishment
at
the
steamers
especially
at
the
pearl
which
accompanied
us
thus
far
up
the
river
one
old
man
who
came
on
board
remarked
that
never
before
had
he
seen
any
vessel
so
large
as
the
pearl
it
was
like
a
village
was
it
made
out
of
one
tree
all
were
eager
traders
and
soon
came
off
to
the
ship
in
light
swift
canoes
with
every
kind
of
fruit
and
food
they
possessed
a
few
brought
honey
and
beeswax
which
are
found
in
quantities
in
the
mangrove
forests
as
the
ships
steamed
off
many
anxious
sellers
ran
along
the
bank
holding
up
fowls
baskets
of
rice
and
meal
and
shouting
malonda
malonda
things
for
sale
while
others
followed
in
canoes
which
they
sent
through
the
water
with
great
velocity
by
means
of
short
broadbladed
paddles
finding
the
pearls
draught
too
great
for
that
part
of
the
river
near
the
island
of
simbo
where
the
branch
called
the
doto
is
given
off
to
the
kongone
on
the
right
bank
and
another
named
chinde
departs
to
the
secret
canal
already
mentioned
on
the
left
the
goods
belonging
to
the
expedition
were
taken
out
of
her
and
placed
on
one
of
the
grassy
islands
about
forty
miles
from
the
bar
the
pearl
then
left
us
and
we
had
to
part
with
our
good
friends
duncan
and
skead
the
former
for
ceylon
the
latter
to
return
to
his
duties
as
government
surveyor
at
the
cape
of
those
who
eventually
did
the
work
of
the
expedition
the
majority
took
a
sober
commonsense
view
of
the
enterprise
in
which
we
were
engaged
some
remained
on
expedition
island
from
the
th
june
until
the
th
august
while
the
launch
and
pinnace
were
carrying
the
goods
up
to
shupanga
and
senna
the
country
was
in
a
state
of
war
our
luggage
was
in
danger
and
several
of
our
party
were
exposed
to
disease
from
inactivity
in
the
malaria
of
the
delta
here
some
had
their
first
introduction
to
african
life
and
african
fever
those
alone
were
safe
who
were
actively
employed
with
the
vessels
and
of
course
remembering
the
perilous
position
of
their
fellows
they
strained
every
nerve
to
finish
the
work
and
take
them
away
large
columns
of
smoke
rose
daily
from
different
points
of
the
horizon
showing
that
the
natives
were
burning
off
the
immense
crops
of
tall
grass
here
a
nuisance
however
valuable
elsewhere
a
white
cloud
was
often
observed
to
rest
on
the
head
of
the
column
as
if
a
current
of
hot
damp
air
was
sent
up
by
the
heat
of
the
flames
and
its
moisture
was
condensed
at
the
top
rain
did
not
follow
though
theorists
have
imagined
that
in
such
cases
it
ought
large
game
buffaloes
and
zebras
were
abundant
abreast
the
island
but
no
men
could
be
seen
on
the
mainland
over
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
we
were
amused
by
the
eccentric
gyrations
and
evolutions
of
flocks
of
small
seedeating
birds
who
in
their
flight
wheeled
into
compact
columns
with
such
military
precision
as
to
give
us
the
impression
that
they
must
be
guided
by
a
leader
and
all
directed
by
the
same
signal
several
other
kinds
of
small
birds
now
go
in
flocks
and
among
others
the
large
senegal
swallow
the
presence
of
this
bird
being
clearly
in
a
state
of
migration
from
the
north
while
the
common
swallow
of
the
country
and
the
brown
kite
are
away
beyond
the
equator
leads
to
the
conjecture
that
there
may
be
a
double
migration
namely
of
birds
from
torrid
climates
to
the
more
temperate
as
this
now
is
as
well
as
from
severe
winters
to
sunny
regions
but
this
could
not
be
verified
by
such
birds
of
passage
as
ourselves
on
reaching
mazaro
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
creek
which
in
floods
communicates
with
the
quillimane
river
we
found
that
the
portuguese
were
at
war
with
a
halfcaste
named
mariano
alias
matakenya
from
whom
they
had
generally
fled
and
who
having
built
a
stockade
near
the
mouth
of
the
shire
owned
all
the
country
between
that
river
and
mazaro
mariano
was
best
known
by
his
native
name
matakenya
which
in
their
tongue
means
trembling
or
quivering
as
trees
do
in
a
storm
he
was
a
keen
slave
hunter
and
kept
a
large
number
of
men
well
armed
with
muskets
it
is
an
entire
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
slave
trade
is
one
of
buying
and
selling
alone
or
that
engagements
can
be
made
with
labourers
in
africa
as
they
are
in
india
mariano
like
other
portuguese
had
no
labour
to
spare
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
sending
out
armed
parties
on
slave
hunting
forays
among
the
helpless
tribes
to
the
northeast
and
carrying
down
the
kidnapped
victims
in
chains
to
quillimane
where
they
were
sold
by
his
brotherinlaw
cruz
coimbra
and
shipped
as
free
emigrants
to
the
french
island
of
bourbon
so
long
as
his
robberies
and
murders
were
restricted
to
the
natives
at
a
distance
the
authorities
did
not
interfere
but
his
men
trained
to
deeds
of
violence
and
bloodshed
in
their
slave
forays
naturally
began
to
practise
on
the
people
nearer
at
hand
though
belonging
to
the
portuguese
and
even
in
the
village
of
senna
under
the
guns
of
the
fort
a
gentleman
of
the
highest
standing
told
us
that
while
at
dinner
with
his
family
it
was
no
uncommon
event
for
a
slave
to
rush
into
the
room
pursued
by
one
of
marianos
men
with
spear
in
hand
to
murder
him
the
atrocities
of
this
villain
aptly
termed
by
the
late
governor
of
quillimane
a
notorious
robber
and
murderer
became
at
length
intolerable
all
the
portuguese
spoke
of
him
as
a
rare
monster
of
inhumanity
it
is
unaccountable
why
halfcastes
such
as
he
are
so
much
more
cruel
than
the
portuguese
but
such
is
undoubtedly
the
case
it
was
asserted
that
one
of
his
favourite
modes
of
creating
an
impression
in
the
country
and
making
his
name
dreaded
was
to
spear
his
captives
with
his
own
hands
on
one
occasion
he
is
reported
to
have
thus
killed
forty
poor
wretches
placed
in
a
row
before
him
we
did
not
at
first
credit
these
statements
and
thought
that
they
were
merely
exaggerations
of
the
incensed
portuguese
who
naturally
enough
were
exasperated
with
him
for
stopping
their
trade
and
harbouring
their
runaway
slaves
but
we
learned
afterwards
from
the
natives
that
the
accounts
given
us
by
the
portuguese
had
not
exceeded
the
truth
and
that
mariano
was
quite
as
great
a
ruffian
as
they
had
described
him
one
expects
slaveowners
to
treat
their
human
chattels
as
well
as
men
do
other
animals
of
value
but
the
slavetrade
seems
always
to
engender
an
unreasoning
ferocity
if
not
bloodthirstiness
war
was
declared
against
mariano
and
a
force
sent
to
take
him
he
resisted
for
a
time
but
seeing
that
he
was
likely
to
get
the
worst
of
it
and
knowing
that
the
portuguese
governors
have
small
salaries
and
are
therefore
disposed
to
be
reasonable
he
went
down
to
quillimane
to
arrange
with
the
governor
as
it
is
termed
here
but
colonel
da
silva
put
him
in
prison
and
then
sent
him
for
trial
to
mozambique
when
we
came
into
the
country
his
people
were
fighting
under
his
brother
bonga
the
war
had
lasted
six
months
and
stopped
all
trade
on
the
river
during
that
period
on
the
th
june
we
first
came
into
contact
with
the
rebels
they
appeared
as
a
crowd
of
wellarmed
and
fantasticallydressed
people
under
the
trees
at
mazaro
on
explaining
that
we
were
english
some
at
once
came
on
board
and
called
to
those
on
shore
to
lay
aside
their
arms
on
landing
among
them
we
saw
that
many
had
the
branded
marks
of
slaves
on
their
chests
but
they
warmly
approved
our
objects
and
knew
well
the
distinctive
character
of
our
nation
on
the
slave
question
the
shout
at
our
departure
contrasted
strongly
with
the
suspicious
questioning
on
our
approach
henceforward
we
were
recognized
as
friends
by
both
parties
at
a
later
period
we
were
taking
in
wood
within
a
mile
of
the
scene
of
action
but
a
dense
fog
prevented
our
hearing
the
noise
of
a
battle
at
mazaro
and
on
arriving
there
immediately
after
many
natives
and
portuguese
appeared
on
the
bank
dr
livingstone
landing
to
salute
some
of
his
old
friends
among
the
latter
found
himself
in
the
sickening
smell
and
among
the
mutilated
bodies
of
the
slain
he
was
requested
to
take
the
governor
who
was
very
ill
of
fever
across
to
shupanga
and
just
as
he
gave
his
assent
the
rebels
renewed
the
fight
and
the
balls
began
to
whistle
about
in
all
directions
after
trying
in
vain
to
get
some
one
to
assist
the
governor
down
to
the
steamer
and
unwilling
to
leave
him
in
such
danger
as
the
officer
sent
to
bring
our
kroomen
did
not
appear
he
went
into
the
hut
and
dragged
along
his
excellency
to
the
ship
he
was
a
very
tall
man
and
as
he
swayed
hither
and
thither
from
weakness
weighing
down
dr
livingstone
it
must
have
appeared
like
one
drunken
man
helping
another
some
of
the
portuguese
white
soldiers
stood
fighting
with
great
bravery
against
the
enemy
in
front
while
a
few
were
coolly
shooting
at
their
own
slaves
for
fleeing
into
the
river
behind
the
rebels
soon
retired
and
the
portuguese
escaped
to
a
sandbank
in
the
zambesi
and
thence
to
an
island
opposite
shupanga
where
they
lay
for
some
weeks
looking
at
the
rebels
on
the
mainland
opposite
this
state
of
inactivity
on
the
part
of
the
portuguese
could
not
well
be
helped
as
they
had
expended
all
their
ammunition
and
were
waiting
anxiously
for
supplies
hoping
no
doubt
sincerely
that
the
enemy
might
not
hear
that
their
powder
had
failed
luckily
their
hopes
were
not
disappointed
the
rebels
waited
until
a
supply
came
and
were
then
repulsed
after
threeandahalf
hours
hard
fighting
two
months
afterwards
marianos
stockade
was
burned
the
garrison
having
fled
in
a
panic
and
as
bonga
declared
that
he
did
not
wish
to
fight
with
this
governor
with
whom
he
had
no
quarrel
the
war
soon
came
to
an
end
his
excellency
meanwhile
being
a
disciple
of
raspail
had
taken
nothing
for
the
fever
but
a
little
camphor
and
after
he
was
taken
to
shupanga
became
comatose
more
potent
remedies
were
administered
to
him
to
his
intense
disgust
and
he
soon
recovered
the
colonel
in
attendance
whom
he
never
afterwards
forgave
encouraged
the
treatment
give
what
is
right
never
mind
him
he
is
very
muito
impertinent
and
all
night
long
with
every
draught
of
water
the
colonel
gave
a
quantity
of
quinine
the
consequence
was
next
morning
the
patient
was
cinchonized
and
better
for
sixty
or
seventy
miles
before
reaching
mazaro
the
scenery
is
tame
and
uninteresting
on
either
hand
is
a
dreary
uninhabited
expanse
of
the
same
level
grassy
plains
with
merely
a
few
trees
to
relieve
the
painful
monotony
the
round
green
top
of
the
stately
palmtree
looks
at
a
distance
when
its
grey
trunk
cannot
be
seen
as
though
hung
in
mid
air
many
flocks
of
busy
sandmartins
which
here
and
as
far
south
as
the
orange
river
do
not
migrate
have
perforated
the
banks
two
or
three
feet
horizontally
in
order
to
place
their
nests
at
the
ends
and
are
now
chasing
on
restless
wing
the
myriads
of
tropical
insects
the
broad
river
has
many
low
islands
on
which
are
seen
various
kinds
of
waterfowl
such
as
geese
spoonbills

and
flamingoes
repulsive
crocodiles
as
with
open
jaws
they
sleep
and
bask
in
the
sun
on
the
low

soon
catch
the
sound
of
the
revolving
paddles
and
glide
quietly
into

selected
some

of

out

has
been
enjoying
his

blows
a
puff
of
spray
from

shakes
the

out
of
his

puts
his
enormous
snout
up
straight
and
yawns
sounding
a
loud
alarm
to
the
rest
of
the
herd
with
notes
as
of
a
monster
bassoon
as
we
approach

the

see
the
wellwooded
shupanga
ridge
stretching
to
the
left
and
in

blue
hills
rise
dimly
far
in
the
distance
there
is
no
trade
whatever
on
the
zambesi
below
mazaro
all
the
merchandise
of
senna
and
tette
is
brought
to
that
point
in
large
canoes
and
thence
carried
six
miles
across
the
country
on
mens
heads
to
be
reshipped
on
a
small
stream
that
flows
into
the
kwakwa

quillimane
river
which
is
entirely
distinct
from

only
on
rare
occasions
and

have
a
bad
name
among
the
portuguese
they
are
said
to
be
expert
thieves
and
the
merchants
sometimes
suffer
from
their
adroitness

their

not

they
must
always
have
it
before
they
start

being
prone
to
assign
plausible
reasons
for
their
conduct
like

in

it

work

sent
us
a
present
of
rice
two
sheep
and
a
quantity
of
firewood
he
never
tried
to
make
any
use
of
us
in
the
strife
the
other
side
showed
less
confidence
by
carefully
crossquestioning
our
pilot
whether
we
had
sold
any

the

we
managed
however
to

senna
is
built
on
a
low
plain
on
the
right
bank
of
the
zambesi
with
some
pretty
detached
hills
in
the
background
it
is
surrounded
by
a
stockade
of
living
trees
to
protect
its
inhabitants
from
their
troublesome
and
rebellious
neighbours
it
contains
a
few
large
houses
some
ruins
of
others
and
a
weatherbeaten
cross
where
once
stood
a
church
a
mound
shows
the
site
of
an
ancient
monastery
and
a
mud
fort
by
the
river
is
so
dilapidated
that
cows
were
grazing
peacefully
over
its
prostrate
walls
the
few
senna
merchants
having
little
or
no
trade
in
the
village
send
parties
of
trusted
slaves
into
the
interior
to
hunt
for
and
purchase
ivory
it
is
a
dull
place
and
very
conducive
to
sleep
one
is
sure
to
take
fever
in
senna
on
the
second

if
by
chance
one
escapes

the
first
day
of
a
sojourn

no

senna
has
one
redeeming
feature
it
is
the
native
village
of
the
largehearted
and
hospitable
senhor
h
a
ferrao
the
benevolence
of
this
gentleman
is
unbounded
the
poor
black
stranger
passing
through
the
town
goes
to
him
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
for
food
and
is
never
sent
away
hungry
in
times
of
famine
the
starving
natives
are
fed
by
his
generosity
hundreds
of
his
own
people
he
never
sees
except
on
these
occasions
and
the
only
benefit
derived
from
being
their
master
is
that
they
lean
on
him
as
a
patriarchal
chief
and
he
has
the
satisfaction
of
settling
their
differences
and
of
saving
their
lives
in
seasons
of
drought
and
scarcity
senhor
ferrao
received
us
with
his
usual
kindness
and
gave
us
a
bountiful
breakfast
during
the
day
the
principal
men
of
the
place
called
and
were
unanimously
of
opinion
that
the
free
natives
would
willingly
cultivate
large
quantities
of
cotton
could
they
find
purchasers
they
had
in
former
times
exported
largely
both
cotton
and
cloth
to
manica
and
even
to
brazil
on
their
own
soil
they
declared
the
natives
are
willing
to
labour
and
trade
provided
only
they
can
do
so
to
advantage
when
it
is
for
their
interest
blacks
work
very
hard
we
often
remarked
subsequently
that
this
was
the
opinion
of
men
of
energy
and
that
all
settlers
of
activity
enterprise
and
sober
habits
had
become
rich
while
those
who
were
much
addicted
to
lying
on
their
backs
smoking
invariably
complained
of
the
laziness
of
the
negroes
and
were
poor
proud
and
despicable
beyond
pita
lies
the
little
island
nyamotobsi
where
we
met
a
small
fugitive
tribe
of
hippopotamus
hunters
who
had
been
driven
by
war
from
their
own
island
in
front
all
were
busy
at
work
some
were
making
gigantic
baskets
for
grain
the
men
plaiting
from
the
inside
with
the
civility
so
common
among
them
the
chief
ordered
a
mat
to
be
spread
for
us
under
a
shed
and
then
showed
us
the
weapon
with
which
they
kill
the
hippopotamus
it
is
a
short
iron
harpoon
inserted
in
the
end
of
a
long
pole
but
being
intended
to
unship
it
is
made
fast
to
a
strong
cord
of
milola
or
hibiscus
bark
which
is
wound
closely
round
the
entire
length
of
the
shaft
and
secured
at
its
opposite
end
two
men
in
a
swift
canoe
steal
quietly
down
on
the
sleeping
animal
the
bowman
dashes
the
harpoon
into
the
unconscious
victim
while
the
quick
steersman
sweeps
the
light
craft
back
with
his
broad
paddle
the
force
of
the
blow
separates
the
harpoon
from
its
corded
handle
which
appearing
on
the
surface
sometimes
with
an
inflated
bladder
attached
guides
the
hunters
to
where
the
wounded
beast
hides
below
until
they
despatch
it
these
hippopotamus
hunters
form
a
separate
people
called
akombwi
or
mapodzo
and
rarelythe
women
it
is
said
neverintermarry
with
any
other
tribe
the
reason
for
their
keeping
aloof
from
certain
of
the
natives
on
the
zambesi
is
obvious
enough
some
having
as
great
an
abhorrence
of
hippopotamus
meat
as
mahomedans
have
of
swines
flesh
our
pilot
scissors
was
one
of
this
class
he
would
not
even
cook
his
food
in
a
pot
which
had
contained
hippopotamus
meat
preferring
to
go
hungry
till
he
could
find
another
and
yet
he
traded
eagerly
in
the
animals
tusks
and
ate
with
great
relish
the
flesh
of
the
foulfeeding
marabout
these
hunters
go
out
frequently
on
long
expeditions
taking
in
their
canoes
their
wives
and
children
cookingpots
and
sleepingmats
when
they
reach
a
good
game
district
they
erect
temporary
huts
on
the
bank
and
there
dry
the
meat
they
have
killed
they
are
rather
a
comelylooking
race
with
very
black
smooth
skins
and
never
disfigure
themselves
with
the
frightful
ornaments
of
some
of
the
other
tribes
the
chief
declined
to
sell
a
harpoon
because
they
could
not
now
get
the
milola
bark
from
the
coast
on
account
of
marianos
war
he
expressed
some
doubts
about
our
being
children
of
the
same
almighty
father
remarking
that
they
could
not
become
white
let
them
wash
ever
so
much
we
made
him
a
present
of
a
bit
of
cloth
and
he
very
generously
gave
us
in
return
some
fine
fresh
fish
and
indian
corn
the
heat
of
the
weather
steadily
increases
during
this
month
august
and
foggy
mornings
are
now
rare
a
strong
breeze
ending
in
a
gale
blows
up
stream
every
night
it
came
in
the
afternoon
a
few
weeks
ago
then
later
and
at
present
its
arrival
is
near
midnight
it
makes
our
frail
cabindoors
fly
open
before
it
but
continues
only
for
a
short
time
and
is
succeeded
by
a
dead
calm

more
abundant
near
our

we
see
herds
of
zebras
both
burchells
and
the

and
wild
hogs
with
the

on
the
right

deserted
a
few
old
iron
guns

where
a
rebel

once
stood
near
the
river
above
this
stands
a
magnificent
baobab
hollowed
out
into
a
goodsized
hut
with
bark
inside
as
well
as
without
the
old
oaks
in
sherwood
forest
when
hollow
have
the
inside
dead
or
rotten
but
the
baobab
though
stripped
of
its
bark
outside
and
hollowed
to
a
cavity
inside
has
the
power
of
exuding
new
bark
from
its
substance
to
both
the
outer
and
inner
surfaces
so
a
hut
made
like
that
in
the
oak
called
the
forest
queen
in
sherwood
would
soon
all
be
lined
with
bark
the
portions
of
the
river
called
shigogo
and
shipanga
are
bordered
by
a
low
level
expanse
of
marshy
country
with
occasional
clumps
of
palmtrees
and
a
few
thorny
acacias
the
river
itself
spreads
out
to
a
width
of
from
three
to
four
miles
with
many
islands
among
which
it
is
difficult
to
navigate
except
when
the
river
is
in
flood
in
front
a
range
of
high
hills
from
the
northeast
crosses
and
compresses
it
into
a
deep
narrow
channel
called
the
lupata
gorge
the
portuguese
thought
the
steamer
would
not
stem
the
current
here
but
as
it
was
not
more
than
about
three
knots
and
as
there
was
a
strong
breeze
in
our
favour
steam
and
sails
got
her
through
with
ease
heavyladen
canoes
take
two
days
to
go
up
this
pass
a
current
sweeps
round
the
little
rocky
promontories
chifura
and
kangomba
forming
whirlpools
and
eddies
dangerous
for
the
clumsy
craft
which
are
dragged
past
with
long
ropes
the
paddlers
place
meal
on
these
rocks
as
an
offering
to
the
turbulent
deities
which
they
believe
preside
over
spots
fatal
to
many
a
large
canoe
we
were
slily
told
that
native
portuguese
take
off
their
hats
to
these
river
gods
and
pass
in
solemn
silence
when
safely
beyond
the
promontories
they
fire
muskets
and
as
we
ought
to
do
give
the
canoe
men
grog
from
the
spoor
of
buffaloes
and
elephants
it
appears
that
these
animals
frequent
lupata
in
considerable
numbers
andwe
have
often
observed
the
associationthe
tsetse

is
common
a

the
governor
of

was
sent
in
a
canoe
from
quillimane
and
lest
it
should
be
wrecked
on
the
chifura
and
kangomba
rocks
it
was
put
on
shore
and
sent
in
the
daytime
through
the
pass
it
was
of
course
bitten
by
the
tsetse
and
died
soon
after
it
was
thought
that
the
air
of
tette
had
not
agreed
with
it
the
currents
above
lupata
are
stronger
than
those
below
the
country
becomes
more
picturesque
and
hilly
and
there
is
a
larger
population
the
ship
anchored
in
the
stream
off
tette
on
the
th
september
and
dr
livingstone
went
ashore
in
the
boat
no
sooner
did
the
makololo
recognize
him
than
they
rushed
to
the
waters
edge
and
manifested
great
joy
at
seeing
him
again
some
were
hastening
to
embrace
him
but
others
cried
out
dont
touch
him
you
will
spoil
his
new
clothes
the
five
headmen
came
on
board
and
listened
in
quiet
sadness
to
the
story
of
poor
sekwebu
who
died
at
the
mauritius
on
his
way
to
england
men
die
in
any
country
they
observed
and
then
told
us
that
thirty
of
their
own
number
had
died
of
smallpox
having
been
bewitched
by
the
people
of
tette
who
envied
them
because
during
the
first
year
none
of
their
party
had
died
six
of
their
young
men
becoming
tired
of
cutting
firewood
for
a
meagre
pittance
proposed
to
go
and
dance
for
gain
before
some
of
the
neighbouring
chiefs
dont
go
said
the
others
we
dont
know
the
people
of
this
country
but
the
young
men
set
out
and
visited
an
independent
halfcaste
chief
a
few
miles
to
the
north
named
chisaka
who
some
years
ago
burned
all
the
portuguese
villas
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
afterwards
the
young
men
went
to
bonga
son
of
another
half
caste
chief
who
bade
defiance
to
the
tette
authorities
and
had
a
stockade
at
the
confluence
of
the
zambesi
and
luenya
a
few
miles
below
that
village
asking
the
makololo
whence
they
came
bonga
rejoined
why
do
you
come
from
my
enemy
to
me
you
have
brought
witchcraft
medicine
to
kill
me
in
vain
they
protested
that
they
did
not
belong
to
the
country
they
were
strangers
and
had
come
from
afar
with
an
englishman
the
superstitious
savage
put
them
all
to
death
we
do
not
grieve
said
their
companions
for
the
thirty
victims
of
the
smallpox
who
were
taken
away
by
morimo
god
but
our
hearts
are
sore
for
the
six
youths
who
were
murdered
by
bonga
any
hope
of
obtaining
justice
on
the
murderer
was
out
of
the
question
bonga
once
caught
a
captain
of
the
portuguese
army
and
forced
him
to
perform
the
menial
labour
of
pounding
maize
in
a
wooden
mortar
no
punishment
followed
on
this
outrage
the
government
of
lisbon
has
since
given
bonga
the
honorary
title
of
captain
by
way
of
coaxing
him
to
own
their
authority
but
he
still
holds
his
stockade
tette
stands
on
a
succession
of
low
sandstone
ridges
on
the
right
bank
of
the
zambesi
which
is
here
nearly
a
thousand
yards
wide
yards
shallow
ravines
running
parallel
with

built
on
the

the
whole
surface
of
the

narrow
footpaths

overrun
with
selfsown

have
been

and

and
the
native
population
live
in
huts
outside
the
fort
and
the
church
near
the
river
are
the
strongholds
the
natives
having
a
salutary
dread
of
the
guns
of
the
one
and
a
superstitious
fear
of
the
unknown
power
of
the
other
the
number
of
white
inhabitants
is
small
and
rather
select
many
of
them
having
been
considerately
sent
out
of
portugal
for
their
countrys
good
the
military
element
preponderates
in
society
the
convict
and
incorrigible
class
of
soldiers
receiving
very
little
pay
depend
in
great
measure
on
the
produce
of
the
gardens
of
their
black
wives
the
moral
condition
of
the
resulting
population
may
be
imagined
droughts
are
of
frequent
occurrence
at
tette
and
the
crops
suffer
severely
this
may
arise
partly
from
the
position
of
the
town
between
the
ranges
of
hills
north
and
south
which
appear
to
have
a
strong
attraction
for
the
rainclouds
it
is
often
seen
to
rain
on
these
hills
when
not
a
drop
falls
at
tette
our
first
season
was
one
of
drought
thrice
had
the
women
planted
their
gardens
in
vain
the
seed
after
just
vegetating
was
killed
by
the
intense
dry
heat
a
fourth
planting
shared
the
same
hard
fate
and
then
some
of
the
knowing
ones
discovered
the
cause
of
the
clouds
being
frightened
away
our
unlucky
raingauge
in
the
garden
we
got
a
bad
name
through
that
same
raingauge
and
were
regarded
by
many
as
a
species
of
evil
omen
the
makololo
in
turn
blamed
the
people
of
tette
for
drought
a
number
of
witches
live
here
who
wont
let
it
rain
africans
in
general
are
sufficiently
superstitious
but
those
of
tette
are
in
this
particular
preeminent
above
their
fellows
coming
from
many
different
tribes
all
the
rays
of
the
separate
superstitions
converge
into
a
focus
at
tette
and
burn
out
common
sense
from
the
minds
of
the
mixed
breed
they
believe
that
many
evil
spirits
live
in
the
air
the
earth
and
the
water
these
invisible
malicious
beings
are
thought
to
inflict
much
suffering
on
the
human
race
but
as
they
have
a
weakness
for
beer
and
a
craving
for
food
they
may
be
propitiated
from
time
to
time
by
offerings
of
meat
and
drink
the
serpent
is
an
object
of
worship
and
hideous
little
images
are
hung
in
the
huts
of
the
sick
and
dying
the
uncontaminated
africans
believe
that
morungo
the
great
spirit
who
formed
all
things
lives
above
the
stars
but
they
never
pray
to
him
and
know
nothing
of
their
relation
to
him
or
of
his
interest
in
them
the
spirits
of
their
departed
ancestors
are
all
good
according
to
their
ideas
and
on
special
occasions
aid
them
in
their
enterprises
when
a
man
has
his
hair
cut
he
is
careful
to
burn
it
or
bury
it
secretly
lest
falling
into
the
hands
of
one
who
has
an
evil
eye
or
is
a
witch
it
should
be
used
as
a
charm
to
afflict
him
with
headache
they
believe
too
that
they
will
live
after
the
death
of
the
body
but
do
not
know
anything
of
the
state
of
the
barimo
gods
or
departed
spirits
the
mangotree
grows
luxuriantly
above
lupata
and
furnishes
a
grateful
shade
its
delicious
fruit
is
superior
to
that
on
the
coast
for
weeks
the
natives
who
have
charge
of
the
mangoes
live
entirely
on
the
fruit
and
as
some
trees
bear
in
november
and
some
in
march
while
the
main
crop
comes
between
fruit
in
abundance
may
easily
be
obtained
during
four
months
of
the
year
but
no
native
can
be
induced
to
plant
a
mango
a
widespread
superstition
has
become
riveted
in
the
native
mind
that
if
any
one
plants
this
tree
he
will
soon
die
the
makololo
like
other
natives
were
very
fond
of
the
fruit
but
when
told
to
take
up
some
mango
stones
on
their
return
and
plant
them
in
their
own
countrythey
too
having
become
deeply
imbued
with
the
belief
that
it
was
a
suicidal
act
to
do
soreplied
they
did
not
wish
to
die
too
soon
there
is
also
a
superstition
even
among
the
native
portuguese
of
tette
that
if
a
man
plants
coffee
he
will
never
afterwards
be
happy
they
drink
it
however
and
seem
the
happier
for
it
the
portuguese
of
tette
have
many
slaves
with
all
the
usual
vices
of
their
class
as
theft
lying
and
impurity
as
a
general
rule
the
real
portuguese
are
tolerably
humane
masters
and
rarely
treat
a
slave
cruelly
this
may
be
due
as
much
to
natural
kindness
of
heart
as
to
a
fear
of
losing
the
slaves
by
their
running
away
when
they
purchase
an
adult
slave
they
buy
at
the
same
time
if
possible
all
his
relations
along
with
him
they
thus
contrive
to
secure
him
to
his
new
home
by
domestic
ties
running
away
then
would
be
to
forsake
all
who
hold
a
place
in
his
heart
for
the
mere
chance
of
acquiring
a
freedom
which
would
probably
be
forfeited
on
his
entrance
into
the
first
native
village
for
the
chief
might
without
compunction
again
sell
him
into
slavery
a
rather
singular
case
of
voluntary
slavery
came
to
our
knowledge
a
free
black
an
intelligent
active
young
fellow
called
chibanti
who
had
been
our
pilot
on
the
river
told
us
that
he
had
sold
himself
into
slavery
on
asking
why
he
had
done
this
he
replied
that
he
was
all
alone
in
the
world
had
neither
father
nor
mother
nor
any
one
else
to
give
him
water
when
sick
or
food
when
hungry
so
he
sold
himself
to
major
sicard
a
notoriously
kind
master
whose
slaves
had
little
to
do
and
plenty
to
eat
and
how
much
did
you
get
for
yourself
we
asked
three
thirty
yard
pieces
of
cotton
cloth
he
replied
and
i
forthwith
bought
a
man
a
woman
and
child
who
cost
me
two
of
the
pieces
and
i
had
one
piece
left
this
at
all
events
showed
a
cool
and
calculating
spirit
he
afterwards
bought
more
slaves
and
in
two
years
owned
a
sufficient
number
to
man
one
of
the
large
canoes
his
master
subsequently
employed
him
in
carrying
ivory
to
quillimane
and
gave
him
cloth
to
hire
mariners
for
the
voyage
he
took
his
own
slaves
of
course
and
thus
drove
a
thriving
business
and
was
fully
convinced
that
he
had
made
a
good
speculation
by
the
sale
of
himself
for
had
he
been
sick
his
master
must
have
supported
him
occasionally
some
of
the
free
blacks
become
slaves
voluntarily
by
going
through
the
simple
but
significant
ceremony
of
breaking
a
spear
in
the
presence
of
their
future
master
a
portuguese
officer
since
dead
persuaded
one
of
the
makololo
to
remain
in
tette
instead
of
returning
to
his
own
country
and
tried
also
to
induce
him
to
break
a
spear
before
him
and
thus
acknowledge
himself
his
slave
but
the
man
was
too
shrewd
for
this
he
was
a
great
elephant
doctor
who
accompanied
the
hunters
told
them
when
to
attack
the
huge
beast
and
gave
them
medicine
to
ensure
success
unlike
the
real
portuguese
many
of
the
halfcastes
are
merciless
slaveholders
their
brutal
treatment
of
the
wretched
slaves
is
notorious
what
a
humane
native
of
portugal
once
said
of
them
is
appropriate
if
not
true
god
made
white
men
and
god
made
black
men
but
the
devil
made
halfcastes
the
officers
and
merchants
send
parties
of
slaves
under
faithful
headmen
to
hunt
elephants
and
to
trade
in
ivory
providing
them
with
a
certain
quantity
of
cloth
beads
etc
and
requiring
so
much
ivory
in
return
these
slaves
think
that
they
have
made
a
good
thing
of
it
when
they
kill
an
elephant
near
a
village
as
the
natives
give
them
beer
and
meal
in
exchange
for
some
of
the
elephants
meat
and
over
every
tusk
that
is
brought
there
is
expended
a
vast
amount
of
time
talk
and
beer
most
of
the
africans
are
naturalborn
traders
they
love
trade
more
for
the
sake
of
trading
than
for
what
they
make
by
it
an
intelligent
gentleman
of
tette
told
us
that
native
traders
often
come
to
him
with
a
tusk
for
sale
consider
the
price
he
offers
demand
more
talk
over
it
retire
to
consult
about
it
and
at
length
go
away
without
selling
it
next
day
they
try
another
merchant
talk
consider
get
puzzled
and
go
off
as
on
the
previous
day
and
continue
this
course
daily
until
they
have
perhaps
seen
every
merchant
in
the
village
and
then
at
last
end
by
selling
the
precious
tusk
to
some
one
for
even
less
than
the
first
merchant
had
offered
their
love
of
dawdling
in
the
transaction
arises
from
the
self
importance
conferred
on
them
by
their
being
the
object
of
the
wheedling
and
coaxing
of
eager
merchants
a
feeling
to
which
even
the
love
of
gain
is
subordinate
the
native
medical
profession
is
reasonably
well
represented
in
addition
to
the
regular
practitioners
who
are
a
really
useful
class
and
know
something
of
their
profession
and
the
nature
and
power
of
certain
medicines
there
are
others
who
devote
their
talents
to
some
speciality
the
elephant
doctor
prepares
a
medicine
which
is
considered
indispensable
to
the
hunters
when
attacking
that
noble
and
sagacious
beast
no
hunter
is
willing
to
venture
out
before
investing
in
this
precious
nostrum
the
crocodile
doctor
sells
a
charm
which
is
believed
to
possess
the
singular
virtue
of
protecting
its
owner
from
crocodiles
unwittingly
we
offended
the
crocodile
school
of
medicine
while
at
tette
by
shooting
one
of
these
huge
reptiles
as
it
lay
basking
in
the
sun
on
a
sandbank
the
doctors
came
to
the
makololo
in
wrath
clamouring
to
know
why
the
white
man
had
shot
their
crocodile
a
sharks
hook
was
baited
one
evening
with
a
dog
of
which
the
crocodile
is
said
to
be
particularly
fond
but
the
doctors
removed
the
bait
on
the
principle
that
the
more
crocodiles
the
more
demand
for
medicine
or
perhaps
because
they
preferred
to
eat
the
dog
themselves
many
of
the
natives
of
this

are
known
as
in

generally

alone
he
has

our
curiosity
had
been
so
much
excited
by
the
reports
we
had
heard
of
the
kebrabasa
rapids
that
we
resolved
to
make
a
short
examination
of
them
and
seized
the
opportunity
of
the
zambesi
being
unusually
low
to
endeavour
to
ascertain
their
character
while
uncovered
by
the
water
we
reached
them
on
the
th
of
november
the
country
between
tette
and
panda
mokua
where
navigation
ends
is
well
wooded
and
hilly
on
both
banks
panda
mokua
is
a
hill
two
miles
below
the
rapids
capped
with
dolomite
containing
copper
ore
conspicuous
among
the
trees
for
its
gigantic
size
and
bark
coloured
exactly
like
egyptian
syenite
is
the
burly
baobab
it
often
makes
the
other
trees
of
the
forest
look
like
mere
bushes
in
comparison
a
hollow

already
mentioned
is
feet
in
circumference
another
was
and
some
have
been
found
on
the
west
coast
which
measure
feet
the
lofty
range
of
kebrabasa
consisting
chiefly
of
conical
hills
covered
with
scraggy
trees
crosses
the
zambesi
and
confines
it
within
a
narrow
rough
and
rocky
dell
of
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
breadth
over
this
which
may
be
called
the
floodbed
of
the
river
large
masses
of
rock
are
huddled
in
indescribable
confusion
the
drawing
for
the
use
of
which
and
of
others
our
thanks
are
due
to
lord
russell
conveys
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
scene
inasmuch
as
the
hills
which
confine
the
river
do
not
appear
in
the
sketch
the
chief
rock
is
syenite
some
portions
of
which
have
a
beautiful
blue
tinge
like
lapis
lazuli
diffused
through
them
others
are
grey
blocks
of
granite
also
abound
of
a
pinkish
tinge
and
these
with
metamorphic
rocks
contorted
twisted
and
thrown
into
every
conceivable
position
afford
a
picture
of
dislocation
or
unconformability
which
would
gladden
a
geological
lecturers
heart
but
at
high
flood
this
rough
channel
is
all
smoothed
over
and
it
then
conforms
well
with
the
river
below
it
which
is
half
a
mile
wide
in
the
dry
season
the
stream
runs
at
the
bottom
of
a
narrow
and
deep
groove
whose
sides
are
polished
and
fluted
by
the
boiling
action
of
the
water
in
flood
like
the
rims
of
ancient
eastern
wells
by
the
drawropes
the
breadth
of
the
groove
is
often
not
more
than
from
forty
to
sixty
yards
and
it
has
some
sharp
turnings
double
channels
and
little
cataracts
in
it
as
we
steamed
up
the
masts
of
the
ma
robert
though
some
thirty
feet
high
did
not
reach
the
level
of
the
floodchannel
above
and
the
man
in
the
chains
sung
out
no
bottom
at
ten
fathoms
huge
potholes
as
large
as
drawwells
had
been
worn
in
the
sides
and
were
so
deep
that
in
some
instances
when
protected
from
the
sun
by
overhanging
boulders
the
water
in
them
was
quite
cool
some
of
these
holes
had
been
worn
right
through
and
only
the
side
next
the
rock
remained
while
the
sides
of
the
groove
of
the
floodchannel
were
polished
as
smooth
as
if
they
had
gone
through
the
granitemills
of
aberdeen
the
pressure
of
the
water
must
be
enormous
to
produce
this
polish
it
had
wedged
round
pebbles
into
chinks
and
crannies
of
the
rocks
so
firmly
that
though
they
looked
quite
loose
they
could
not
be
moved
except
with
a
hammer
the
mighty
power
of
the
water
here
seen
gave
us
an
idea
of
what
is
going
on
in
thousands
of
cataracts
in
the
world
all
the
information
we
had
been
able
to
obtain
from
our
portuguese
friends
amounted
to
this
that
some
three
or
four
detached
rocks
jutted
out
of
the
river
in
kebrabasa
which
though
dangerous
to
the
cumbersome
native
canoes
could
be
easily
passed
by
a
steamer
and
that
if
one
or
two
of
these
obstructions
were
blasted
away
with
gunpowder
no
difficulty
would
hereafter
be
experienced
after
we
had
painfully
explored
seven
or
eight
miles
of
the
rapid
we
returned
to
the
vessel
satisfied
that
much
greater
labour
was
requisite
for
the
mere
examination
of
the
cataracts
than
our
friends
supposed
necessary
to
remove
them
we
therefore
went
down
the
river
for
fresh
supplies
and
made
preparation
for
a
more
serious
survey
of
this
region
the
steamer
having
returned
from
the
bar
we
set
out
on
the
nd
of
november
to
examine
the
rapids
of
kebrabasa
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
hills
again
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
th
and
anchored
in
the
stream
canoemen
never
sleep
on
the
river
but
always
spend
the
night
on
shore
the
natives
on
the
right
bank
in
the
country
called
shidima
who
are
banyai
and
even
at
this
short
distance
from
tette
independent
and
accustomed
to
lord
it
over
portuguese
traders
wondered
what
could
be
our
object
in
remaining
afloat
and
were
naturally
suspicious
at
our
departing
from
the
universal
custom
they
hailed
us
from
the
bank
in
the
evening
with
why
dont
you
come
and
sleep
onshore
like
other
people
the
answer
they
received
from
our
makololo
who
now
felt
as
independent
as
the
banyai
was
we
are
held
to
the
bottom
with
iron
you
may
see
we
are
not
like
your
bazungu
this
hint
a
little
amplified
saved
us
from
the
usual
exactions
it
is
pleasant
to
give
a
present
but
that
pleasure
the
banyai
usually
deny
to
strangers
by
making
it
a
fine
and
demanding
it
in
such
a
supercilious
way
that
only
a
sorely
cowed
trader
could
bear
it
they
often
refuse
to
touch
what
is
offeredthrow
it
down
and
leave
itsneer
at
the
traders
slaves
and
refuse
a
passage
until
the
tribute
is
raised
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
means
leaving
the
steamer
next
morning
we
proceeded
on
foot
accompanied
by
a
native
portuguese
and
his
men
and
a
dozen
makololo
who
carried
our
baggage
the
morning
was
pleasant
the
hills
on
our
right
furnished
for
a
time
a
delightful
shade
but
before
long
the
path
grew
frightfully
rough
and
the
hills
no
longer
shielded
us
from
the
blazing
sun
scarcely
a
vestige
of
a
track
was
now
visible
and
indeed
had
not
our
guide
assured
us
to
the
contrary
we
should
have
been
innocent
of
even
the
suspicion
of
a
way
along
the
patches
of
soft
yielding
sand
and
on
the
great
rocks
over
which
we
so
painfully
clambered
these
rocks
have
a
singular
appearance
from
being
dislocated
and
twisted
in
every
direction
and
covered
with
a
thin
black
glaze
as
if
highly
polished
and
coated
with
lampblack
varnish
this
seems
to
have
been
deposited
while
the
river
was
in
flood
for
it
covers
only
those
rocks
which
lie
between
the
highest
watermark
and
a
line
about
four
feet
above
the
lowest
travellers
who
have
visited
the
rapids
of
the
orinoco
and
the
congo
say
that
the
rocks
there
have
a
similar
appearance
and
it
is
attributed
to
some
deposit
from
the
water
formed
only
when
the
current
is
strong
this
may
account
for
it
in
part
here
as
it
prevails
only
where
the
narrow
river
is
confined
between
masses
of
rock
backed
by
high
hills
and
where
the
current
in
floods
is
known
to
be
the
strongest
and
it
does
not
exist
where
the
rocks
are
only
on
one
side
with
a
sandy
beach
opposite
and
a
broad
expanse
of
river
between
the
hot
rocks
burnt
the
thick
soles
of
our
mens
feet
and
sorely
fatigued
ourselves
our
first
days
march
did
not
exceed
four
miles
in
a
straight
line
and
that
we
found
more
than
enough
to
be
pleasant
the
state
of
insecurity
in
which
the
badema
tribe
live
is
indicated
by
the
habit
of
hiding
their
provisions
in
the
hills
and
keeping
only
a
small
quantity
in
their
huts
they
strip
a
particular
species
of
tree
of
its
bitter
bark
to
which
both
mice
and
monkeys
are
known
to
have
an
antipathy
and
turning
the
bark
inside
out
sew
it
into
cylindrical
vessels
for
their
grain
and
bury
them
in
holes
and
in
crags
on
the
wooded
hillsides
by
this
means
should
a
marauding
party
plunder
their
huts
they
save
a
supply
of
corn
they
could
give
us
no
information
and
they
had
no
food
chisakas
men
had
robbed
them
a
few
weeks
before
never
mind
said
our
native
portuguese
they
will
sell
you
plenty
when
you
return
they
are
afraid
of
you
now
as
yet
they
do
not
know
who
you
are
we
slept
under
trees
in
the
open
air
and
suffered
no
inconvenience
from
either
mosquitoes
or
dew
and
no
prowling
wild
beast
troubled
us
though
one
evening
while
we
were
here
a
native
sitting
with
some
others
on
the
opposite
bank
was
killed
by
a
leopard
one
of
the
tette
slaves
who
wished
to
be
considered
a
great
traveller
gave
us
as
we
sat
by
our
evening
fire
an
interesting
account
of
a
strange
race
of
men
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
interior
they
were
only
three
feet
high
and
had
horns
growing
out
of
their
heads
they
lived
in
a
large
town
and
had
plenty
of
food
the
makololo
poohpoohed
this
story
and
roundly
told
the
narrator
that
he
was
telling
a
downright
lie
we
come
from
the
interior
cried
out
a
tall
fellow
measuring
some
six
feet
four
are
we
dwarfs
have
we
horns
on
our
heads
and
thus
they
laughed
the
fellow
to
scorn
but
he
still
stoutly
maintained
that
he
had
seen
these
little
people
and
had
actually
been
in
their
town
thus
making
himself
the
hero
of
the
traditional
story
which
before
and
since
the
time
of
herodotus
has
with
curious
persistency
clung
to
the
native
mind
the
mere
fact
that
such
absurd
notions
are
permanent
even
in
the
entire
absence
of
literature
invests
the
religious
ideas
of
these
people
also
with
importance
as
fragments
of
the
wreck
of
the
primitive
faith
floating
down
the
stream
of
time
we
waded
across
the
rapid
luia
which
took
us
up
to
the
waist
and
was
about
forty
yards
wide
the
water
was
discoloured
at
the
time
and
we
were
not
without
apprehension
that
a
crocodile
might
chance
to
fancy
a
white
man
for
dinner
next
day
one
of
the
men
crawled
over
the
black
rocks
to
within
ten
yards
of
a
sleeping
hippopotamus
and
shot
him
through
the
brain
the
weather
being
warm
the
body
floated
in
a
few
hours
and
some
of
us
had
our
first
trial
of
hippopotamus
flesh
it
is
a
crossgrained
meat
something
between
pork
and
beefpretty
good
food
when
one
is
hungry
and
can
get
nothing
better
when
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
named
chipereziwa
whose
perpendicular
rocky
sides
are
clothed
with
manycoloured
lichens
our
portuguese
companion
informed
us
there
were
no
more
obstructions
to
navigation
the
river
being
all
smooth
above
he
had
hunted
there
and
knew
it
well
supposing
that
the
object
of
our
trip
was
accomplished
we
turned
back
but
two
natives
who
came
to
our
camp
at
night
assured
us
that
a
cataract
called
morumbwa
did
still
exist
in
front
drs
livingstone
and
kirk
then
decided
to
go
forward
with
three
makololo
and
settle
the
question
for
themselves
it
was
as
tough
a
bit
of
travel
as
they
ever
had
in
africa
and
after
some
painful
marching
the
badema
guides
refused
to
go
further
the
banyai
they
said
would
be
angry
if
they
showed
white
men
the
country
and
there
was
besides
no
practicable
approach
to
the
spot
neither
elephant
nor
hippopotamus
nor
even
a
crocodile
could
reach
the
cataract
the
slopes
of
the
mountains
on
each
side
of
the
river
now
not
yards
wide
and
without
the
flattish
floodchannel
and
groove
were
more
than
feet
from
the
skyline
down
and
were
covered
either
with
dense
thornbush
or
huge
black
boulders
this
deep
troughlike
shape
caused
the
suns
rays
to
converge
as
into
a
focus
making
the
surface
so
hot
that
the
soles
of
the
feet
of
the
makololo
became
blistered
around
and
up
and
down
the
party
clambered
among
these
heated
blocks
at
a
pace
not
exceeding
a
mile
an
hour
the
strain
upon
the
muscles
in
jumping
from
crag
to
boulder
and
wriggling
round
projections
took
an
enormous
deal
out
of
them
and
they
were
often
glad
to
cower
in
the
shadow
formed
by
one
rock
overhanging
and
resting
on
another
the
shelter
induced
the
peculiarly
strong
and
overpowering
inclination
to
sleep
which
too
much
sun
sometimes
causes
this
sleep
is
curative
of
what
may
be
incipient
sunstroke
in
its
first
gentle
touches
it
caused
the
dream
to
flit
over
the
boiling
brain
that
they
had
become
lunatics
and
had
been
sworn
in
as
members
of
the
alpine
club
and
then
it
became
so
heavy
that
it
made
them
feel
as
if
a
portion
of
existence
had
been
cut
out
from
their
lives
the
sun
is
excessively
hot
and
feels
sharp
in
africa
but
probably
from
the
greater
dryness
of
the
atmosphere
we
never
heard
of
a
single
case
of
sunstroke
so
common
in
india
the
makololo
told
dr
livingstone
they
always
thought
he
had
a
heart
but
now
they
believed
he
had
none
and
tried
to
persuade
dr
kirk
to
return
on
the
ground
that
it
must
be
evident
that
in
attempting
to
go
where
no
living
foot
could
tread
his
leader
had
given
unmistakeable
signs
of
having
gone
mad
all
their
efforts
of
persuasion
however
were
lost
upon
dr
kirk
as
he
had
not
yet
learned
their
language
and
his
leader
knowing
his
companion
to
be
equally
anxious
with
himself
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
navigableness
of
kebrabasa
was
not
at
pains
to
enlighten
him
at
one
part
a
bare
mountain
spur
barred
the
way
and
had
to
be
surmounted
by
a
perilous
and
circuitous
route
along
which
the
crags
were
so
hot
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
for
the
hand
to
hold
on
long
enough
to
ensure
safety
in
the
passage
and
had
the
foremost
of
the
party
lost
his
hold
he
would
have
hurled
all
behind
him
into
the
river
at
the
foot
of
the
promontory
yet
in
this
wild
hot
region
as
they
descended
again
to
the
river
they
met
a
fisherman
casting
his
handnet
into
the
boiling
eddies
and
he
pointed
out
the
cataract
of
morumbwa
within
an
hour
they
were
trying
to
measure
it
from
an
overhanging
rock
at
a
height
of
about
one
hundred
feet
when
you
stand
facing
the
cataract
on
the
north
bank
you
see
that
it
is
situated
in
a
sudden
bend
of
the
river
which
is
flowing
in
a
short
curve
the
river
above
it
is
jammed
between
two
mountains
in
a
channel
with
perpendicular
sides
and
less
than
fifty
yards
wide
one
or
two
masses
of
rock
jut
out
and
then
there
is
a
sloping
fall
of
perhaps
twenty
feet
in
a
distance
of
thirty
yards
it
would
stop
all
navigation
except
during
the
highest
floods
the
rocks
showed
that
the
water
then
rises
upwards
of
eighty
feet
perpendicularly
still
keeping
the
position
facing
the
cataract
on
its
right
side
rises
mount
morumbwa
from
to
feet
high
which
gives
the
name
to
the
spot
on
the
left
of
the
cataract
stands
a
noticeable
mountain
which
may
be
called
onionshaped
for
it
is
partly
conical
and
a
large
concave
flake
has
peeled
off
as
granite
often
does
and
left
a
broad
smooth
convex
face
as
if
it
were
an
enormous
bulb
these
two
mountains
extend
their
bases
northwards
about
half
a
mile
and
the
river
in
that
distance
still
very
narrow
is
smooth
with
a
few
detached
rocks
standing
out
from
its
bed
they
climbed
as
high
up
the
base
of
mount
morumbwa
which
touches
the
cataract
as
they
required
the
rocks
were
all
waterworn
and
smooth
with
huge
potholes
even
at
feet
above
low
water
when
at
a
later
period
they
climbed
up
the
northwestern
base
of
this
same
mountain
the
familiar
face
of
the
onionshaped
one
opposite
was
at
once
recognised
one
point
of
view
on
the
talus
of
mount
morumbwa
was
not
more
than
or
yards
distant
from
the
other
and
they
then
completed
the
survey
of
kebrabasa
from
end
to
end
they
did
not
attempt
to
return
by
the
way
they
came
but
scaled
the
slope
of
the
mountain
on
the
north
it
took
them
three
hours
hard
labour
in
cutting
their
way
up
through
the
dense
thornbush
which
covered
the
ascent
the
face
of
the
slope
was
often
about
an
angle
of
degrees
yet
their
guide
shokumbenla
whose
hard
horny
soles
resembling
those
of
elephants
showed
that
he
was
accustomed
to
this
rough
and
hot
work
carried
a
pot
of
water
for
them
nearly
all
the
way
up
they
slept
that
night
at
a
well
in
a
tufaceous
rock
on
the
nw
of
chipereziwa
and
never
was
sleep
more
sweet
a
band
of
native
musicians
came
to
our
camp
one
evening
on
our
own
way
down
and
treated
us
with
their
wild
and
not
unpleasant
music
on
the
marimba
an
instrument
formed
of
bars
of
hard
wood
of
varying
breadth
and
thickness
laid
on
differentsized
hollow
calabashes
and
tuned
to
give
the
notes
a
few
pieces
of
cloth
pleased
them
and
they
passed
on
the
rainy
season
of
tette
differs
a
little
from
that
of
some
of
the
other
intertropical
regions
the
quantity
of
rainfall
being
considerably
less
it
begins
in
november
and
ends
in
april
during
our
first
season
in
that
place
only
a
little
over
nineteen
inches
of
rain
fell
in
an
average
year
and
when
the
crops
are
good
the
fall
amounts
to
about
thirtyfive
inches
on
many
days
it
does
not
rain
at
all
and
rarely
is
it
wet
all
day
some
days
have
merely
a
passing
shower
preceded
and
followed
by
hot
sunshine
occasionally
an
interval
of
a
week
or
even
a
fortnight
passes
without
a
drop
of
rain
and
then
the
crops
suffer
from
the
sun
these
partial
droughts
happen
in
december
and
january
the
heat
appears
to
increase
to
a
certain
point
in
the
different
latitudes
so
as
to
necessitate
a
change
by
some
law
similar
to
that
which
regulates
the
intense
cold
in
other
countries
after
several
days
of
progressive
heat
here
on
the
hottest
of
which
the
thermometer
probably
reaches
degrees
in
the
shade
a
break
occurs
in
the
weather
and
a
thunderstorm
cools
the
air
for
a
time
at
kuruman
when
the
thermometer
stood
above
degrees
rain
might
be
expected
at
kolobeng
the
point
at
which
we
looked
for
a
storm
was
degrees
the
zambesi
is
in
flood
twice
in
the
course
of
the
year
the
first
flood
a
partial
one
attains
its
greatest
height
about
the
end
of
december
or
beginning
of
january
the
second
and
greatest
occurs
after
the
river
inundates
the
interior
in
a
manner
similar
to
the
overflow
of
the
nile
this
rise
not
taking
place
at
tette
until
march
the
portuguese
say
that
the
greatest
height
which
the
march
floods
attain
is
thirty
feet
at
tette
and
this
happens
only
about
every
fourth
year
their
observations
however
have
never
been
very
accurate
on
anything
but
ivory
and
they
have
in
this
case
trusted
to
memory
alone
the
only
fluviometer
at
tette
or
anywhere
else
on
the
river
was
set
up
at
our
suggestion
and
the
first
flood
was
at
its
greatest
height
of
thirteen
feet
six
inches
on
the
th
january
and
then
gradually
fell
a
few
feet
until
succeeded
by
the
greater
flood
of
march
the
river
rises
suddenly
the
water
is
highly
discoloured
and
impure
and
there
is
a
fourknot
current
in
many
places
but
in
a
day
or
two
after
the
first
rush
of
waters
is
passed
the
current
becomes
more
equally
spread
over
the
whole
bed
of
the
river
and
resumes
its
usual
rate
in
the
channel
although
continuing
in
flood
the
zambesi
water
at
other
times
is
almost
chemically
pure
and
the
photographer
would
find
that
it
is
nearly
as
good
as
distilled
water
for
the
nitrate
of
silver
bath
a
third
visit
to
kebrabasa
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
it
might
be
navigable
when
the
zambesi
was
in
flood
the
chief
point
of
interest
being
of
course
morumbwa
it
was
found
that
the
rapids
observed
in
our
first
trip
had
disappeared
and
that
while
they
were
smoothed
over
in
a
few
places
the
current
had
increased
in
strength
as
the
river
fell
rapidly
while
we
were
on
the
journey
the
cataract
of
morumbwa
did
not
differ
materially
from
what
it
was
when
discovered
some
fishermen
assured
us
that
it
was
not
visible
when
the
river
was
at
its
fullest
and
that
the
current
was
then
not
very
strong
on
this
occasion
we
travelled
on
the
right
bank
and
found
it
with
the
additional
inconvenience
of
rain
as
rough
and
fatiguing
as
the
left
had
been
our
progress
was
impeded
by
the
tall
wet
grass
and
dripping
boughs
and
consequent
fever
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
journey
we
came
upon
a
few
deserted
hamlets
only
but
at
last
in
a
pleasant
valley
we
met
some
of
the
people
of
the
country
who
were
miserably
poor
and
hungry
the
women
were
gathering
wild
fruits
in
the
woods
a
young
man
having
consented
for
two
yards
of
cotton
cloth
to
show
us
a
short
path
to
the
cataract
led
us
up
a
steep
hill
to
a
village
perched
on
the
edge
of
one
of
its
precipices
a
thunderstorm
coming
on
at
the
time
the
headman
invited
us
to
take
shelter
in
a
hut
until
it
had
passed
our
guide
having
informed
him
of
what
he
knew
and
conceived
to
be
our
object
was
favoured
in
return
with
a
long
reply
in
wellsounding
blank
verse
at
the
end
of
every
line
the
guide
who
listened
with
deep
attention
responded
with
a
grunt
which
soon
became
so
ludicrous
that
our
men
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
neither
the
poet
nor
the
responsive
guide
took
the
slightest
notice
of
their
rudeness
but
kept
on
as
energetically
as
ever
to
the
end
the
speech
or
more
probably
our
bad
manners
made
some
impression
on
our
guide
for
he
declined
although
offered
double
pay
to
go
any
further
a
great
deal
of
fever
comes
in
with
march
and
april
in
march
if
considerable
intervals
take
place
between
the
rainy
days
and
in
april
always
for
then
large
surfaces
of
mud
and
decaying
vegetation
are
exposed
to
the
hot
sun
in
general
an
attack
does
not
continue
long
but
it
pulls
one
down
quickly
though
when
the
fever
is
checked
the
strength
is
as
quickly
restored
it
had
long
been
observed
that
those
who
were
stationed
for
any
length
of
time
in
one
spot
and
lived
sedentary
lives
suffered
more
from
fever
than
others
who
moved
about
and
had
both
mind
and
body
occupied
but
we
could
not
all
go
in
the
small
vessel
when
she
made
her
trips
during
which
the
change
of
place
and
scenery
proved
so
conducive
to
health
and
some
of
us
were
obliged
to
remain
in
charge
of
the
expeditions
property
making
occasional
branch
trips
to
examine
objects
of
interest
in
the
vicinity
whatever
may
be
the
cause
of
the
fever
we
observed
that
all
were
often
affected
at
the
same
time
as
if
from
malaria
this
was
particularly
the
case
during
a
north
wind
it
was
at
first
commonly
believed
that
a
daily
dose
of
quinine
would
prevent
the
attack
for
a
number
of
months
all
our
men
except
two
took
quinine
regularly
every
morning
the
fever
some
times
attacked
the
believers
in
quinine
while
the
unbelievers
in
its
prophylactic
powers
escaped
whether
we
took
it
daily
or
omitted
it
altogether
for
months
made
no
difference
the
fever
was
impartial
and
seized
us
on
the
days
of
quinine
as
regularly
and
as
severely
as
when
it
remained
undisturbed
in
the
medicine
chest
and
we
finally
abandoned
the
use
of
it
as
a
prophylactic
altogether
the
best
preventive
against
fever
is
plenty
of
interesting
work
to
do
and
abundance
of
wholesome
food
to
eat
to
a
man
well
housed
and
clothed
who
enjoys
these
advantages
the
fever
at
tette
will
not
prove
a
more
formidable
enemy
than
a
common
cold
but
let
one
of
these
be
wantinglet
him
be
indolent
or
guilty
of
excesses
in
eating
or
drinking
or
have
poor
scanty
fareand
the
fever
will
probably
become
a
more
serious
matter
it
is
of
a
milder
type
at
tette
than
at
quillimane
or
on
the
low
seacoast
and
as
in
this
part
of
africa
one
is
as
liable
to
fever
as
to
colds
in
england
it
would
be
advisable
for
strangers
always
to
hasten
from
the
coast
to
the
high
lands
in
order
that
when
the
seizure
does
take
place
it
may
be
of
the
mildest
type
although
quinine
was
not
found
to
be
a
preventive
except
possibly
in
the
way
of
acting
as
a
tonic
and
rendering
the
system
more
able
to
resist
the
influence
of
malaria
it
was
found
invaluable
in
the
cure
of
the
complaint
as
soon
as
pains
in
the
back
sore
bones
headache
yawning
quick
and
sometimes
intermittent
pulse
noticeable
pulsations
of
the
jugulars
with
suffused
eyes
hot
skin
and
foul
tongue
began
very
curious
are
the
effects
of
african
fever
on
certain
minds
cheerfulness
vanishes
and
the
whole
mental
horizon
is
overcast
with
black
clouds
of
gloom
and
sadness
the
liveliest
joke
cannot
provoke
even
the
semblance
of
a
smile
the
countenance
is
grave
the
eyes
suffused
and
the
few
utterances
are
made
in
the
piping
voice
of
a
wailing
infant
an
irritable
temper
is
often
the
first
symptom
of
approaching
fever
at
such
times
a
man
feels
very
much
like
a
fool
if
he
does
not
act
like
one
nothing
is
right
nothing
pleases
the
fever
stricken
victim
he
is
peevish
prone
to
find
fault
and
to
contradict
and
think
himself
insulted
and
is
exactly
what
an
irish
naval
surgeon
before
a
courtmartial
defined
a
drunken
man
to
be
a
man
unfit
for
society
finding
that
it
was
impossible
to
take
our
steamer
of
only
tenhorse
power
through
kebrabasa
and
convinced
that
in
order
to
force
a
passage
when
the
river
was
in
flood
much
greater
power
was
required
due
information
was
forwarded
to
her
majestys
government
and
application
made
for
a
more
suitable
vessel
our
attention
was
in
the
mean
time
turned
to
the
exploration
of
the
river
shire
a
northern
tributary
of
the
zambesi
which
joins
it
about
a
hundred
miles
from
the
sea
we
could
learn
nothing
satisfactory
from
the
portuguese
regarding
this
affluent
no
one
they
said
had
ever
been
up
it
nor
could
they
tell
whence
it
came
years
ago
a
portuguese
expedition
is
said
however
to
have
attempted
the
ascent
but
to
have
abandoned
it
on
account
of
the
impenetrable
duckweed
pistia
stratiotes
we
could
not
learn
from
any
record
that
the
shire
had
ever
been
ascended
by
europeans
as
far
therefore
as
we
were
concerned
the
exploration
was
absolutely
new
all
the
portuguese
believed
the
manganja
to
be
brave
but
bloodthirsty
savages
and
on
our
return
we
found
that
soon
after
our
departure
a
report
was
widely
spread
that
our
temerity
had
been
followed
by
fatal
results
dr
livingstone
having
been
shot
and
dr
kirk
mortally
wounded
by
poisoned
arrows
our
first
trip
to
the
shire
was
in
january
a
considerable
quantity
of
weed
floated
down
the
river
for
the
first
twentyfive
miles
but
not
sufficient
to
interrupt
navigation
with
canoes
or
with
any
other
craft
nearly
the
whole
of
this
aquatic
plant
proceeds
from
a
marsh
on
the
west
and
comes
into
the
river
a
little
beyond
a
lofty
hill
called
mount
morambala
above
that
there
is
hardly
any
as
we
approached
the
villages
the
natives
collected
in
large
numbers
armed
with
bows
and
poisoned
arrows
and
some
dodging
behind
trees
were
observed
taking
aim
as
if
on
the
point
of
shooting
all
the
women
had
been
sent
out
of
the
way
and
the
men
were
evidently
prepared
to
resist
aggression
at
the
village
of
a
chief
named
tingane
at
least
five
hundred
natives
collected
and
ordered
us
to
stop
dr
livingstone
went
ashore
and
on
his
explaining
that
we
were
english
and
had
come
neither
to
take
slaves
nor
to
fight
but
only
to
open
a
path
by
which
our
countrymen
might
follow
to
purchase
cotton
or
whatever
else
they
might
have
to
sell
except
slaves
tingane
became
at
once
quite
friendly
the
presence
of
the
steamer
which
showed
that
they
had
an
entirely
new
people
to
deal
with
probably
contributed
to
this
result
for
tingane
was
notorious
for
being
the
barrier
to
all
intercourse
between
the
portuguese
black
traders
and
the
natives
further
inland
none
were
allowed
to
pass
him
either
way
he
was
an
elderly
wellmade
man
greyheaded
and
over
six
feet
high
though
somewhat
excited
by
our
presence
he
readily
complied
with
the
request
to
call
his
people
together
in
order
that
all
might
know
what
our
objects
were
in
commencing
intercourse
with
any
people
we
almost
always
referred
to
the
english
detestation
of
slavery
most
of
them
already
possess
some
information
respecting
the
efforts
made
by
the
english
at
sea
to
suppress
the
slavetrade
and
our
work
being
to
induce
them
to
raise
and
sell
cotton
instead
of
capturing
and
selling
their
fellowmen
our
errand
appears
quite
natural
and
as
they
all
have
clear
ideas
of
their
own
self
interest
and
are
keen
traders
the
reasonableness
of
the
proposal
is
at
once
admitted
and
as
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being
the
maker
and
ruler
of
all
things
and
in
the
continued
existence
of
departed
spirits
is
universal
it
becomes
quite
appropriate
to
explain
that
we
possess
a
book
containing
a
revelation
of
the
will
of
him
to
whom
in
their
natural
state
they
recognise
no
relationship
the
fact
that
his
son
appeared
among
men
and
left
his
words
in
his
book
always
awakens
attention
but
the
great
difficulty
is
to
make
them
feel
that
they
have
any
relationship
to
him
and
that
he
feels
any
interest
in
them
the
numbness
of
moral
perception
exhibited
is
often
discouraging
but
the
mode
of
communication
either
by
interpreters
or
by
the
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
language
which
not
even
missionaries
of
talent
can
overcome
save
by
the
labour
of
many
years
may
in
part
account
for
the
phenomenon
however
the
idea
of
the
father
of
all
being
displeased
with
his
children
for
selling
or
killing
each
other
at
once
gains
their
ready
assent
it
harmonizes
so
exactly
with
their
own
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
but
as
in
our
own
case
at
home
nothing
less
than
the
instruction
and
example
of
many
years
will
secure
their
moral
elevation
the
dialect
spoken
here
closely
resembles
that
used
at
senna
and
tette
we
understood
it
at
first
only
enough
to
know
whether
our
interpreter
was
saying
what
we
bade
him
or
was
indulging
in
his
own
version
after
stating
pretty
nearly
what
he
was
told
he
had
an
inveterate
tendency
to
wind
up
with
the
book
says
you
are
to
grow
cotton
and
the
english
are
to
come
and
buy
it
or
with
some
joke
of
his
own
which
might
have
been
ludicrous
had
it
not
been
seriously
distressing
in
the
first
ascent
of
the
shire
our
attention
was
chiefly
directed
to
the
river
itself
the
delight
of
threading
out
the
meanderings
of
upwards
of
miles
of
a
hitherto
unexplored
river
must
be
felt
to
be
appreciated
all
the
lower
part
of
the
river
was
found
to
be
at
least
two
fathoms
in
depth
it
became
shallower
higher
up
where
many
departing
and
reentering
branches
diminished
the
volume
of
water
but
the
absence
of
sandbanks
made
it
easy
of
navigation
we
had
to
exercise
the
greatest
care
lest
anything
we
did
should
be
misconstrued
by
the
crowds
who
watched
us
after
having
made
in
a
straight
line
one
hundred
miles
although
the
windings
of
the
river
had
fully
doubled
the
distance
we
found
further
progress
with
the
steamer
arrested
in
degrees
minutes
south
by
magnificent
cataracts
which
we
called
the
murchison
after
one
whose
name
has
already
a
worldwide
fame
and
whose
generous
kindness
we
can
never
repay
the
native
name
of
that
figured
in
the
woodcut
is
mamvira
it
is
that
at
which
the
progress
of
the
steamer
was
first
stopped
the
angle
of
descent
is
much
smaller
than
that
of
the
five
cataracts
above
it
indeed
so
small
as
compared
with
them
that
after
they
were
discovered
this
was
not
included
in
the
number
a
few
days
were
spent
here
in
the
hope
that
there
might
be
an
opportunity
of
taking
observations
for
longitude
but
it
rained
most
of
the
time
or
the
sky
was
overcast
it
was
deemed
imprudent
to
risk
a
land
journey
whilst
the
natives
were
so
very
suspicious
as
to
have
a
strong
guard
on
the
banks
of
the
river
night
and
day
the
weather
also
was
unfavourable
after
sending
presents
and
messages
to
two
of
the
chiefs
we
returned
to
tette
in
going
down
stream
our
progress
was
rapid
as
we
were
aided
by
the
current
the
hippopotami
never
made
a
mistake
but
got
out
of
our
way
the
crocodiles
not
so
wise
sometimes
rushed
with
great
velocity
at
us
thinking
that
we
were
some
huge
animal
swimming
they
kept
about
a
foot
from
the
surface
but
made
three
welldefined
ripples
from
the
feet
and
body
which
marked
their
rapid
progress
raising
the
head
out
of
the
water
when
only
a
few
yards
from
the
expected
feast
down
they
went
to
the
bottom
like
a
stone
without
touching
the
boat
in
the
middle
of
march
of
the
same
year
we
started
again
for
a
second
trip
on
the
shire
the
natives
were
now
friendly
and
readily
sold
us
rice
fowls
and
corn
we
entered
into
amicable
relations
with
the
chief
chibisa
whose
village
was
about
ten
miles
below
the
cataract
he
had
sent
two
men
on
our
first
visit
to
invite
us
to
drink
beer
but
the
steamer
was
such
a
terrible
apparition
to
them
that
after
shouting
the
invitation
they
jumped
ashore
and
left
their
canoe
to
drift
down
the
stream
chibisa
was
a
remarkably
shrewd
man
the
very
image
save
his
dark
hue
of
one
of
our
most
celebrated
london
actors
and
the
most
intelligent
chief
by
far
in
this
quarter
a
great
deal
of
fighting
had
fallen
to
his
lot
he
said
but
it
was
always
others
who
began
he
was
invariably
in
the
right
and
they
alone
were
to
blame
he
was
moreover
a
firm
believer
in
the
divine
right
of
kings
he
was
an
ordinary
man
he
said
when
his
father
died
and
left
him
the
chieftainship
but
directly
he
succeeded
to
the
high
office
he
was
conscious
of
power
passing
into
his
head
and
down
his
back
he
felt
it
enter
and
knew
that
he
was
a
chief
clothed
with
authority
and
possessed
of
wisdom
and
people
then
began
to
fear
and
reverence
him
he
mentioned
this
as
one
would
a
fact
of
natural
history
any
doubt
being
quite
out
of
the
question
his
people
too
believed
in
him
for
they
bathed
in
the
river
without
the
slightest
fear
of
crocodiles
the
chief
having
placed
a
powerful
medicine
there
which
protected
them
from
the
bite
of
these
terrible
reptiles
leaving
the
vessel
opposite
chibisas
village
drs
livingstone
and
kirk
and
a
number
of
the
makololo
started
on
foot
for
lake
shirwa
they
travelled
in
a
northerly
direction
over
a
mountainous
country
the
people
were
far
from
being
welldisposed
to
them
and
some
of
their
guides
tried
to
mislead
them
and
could
not
be
trusted
masakasa
a
makololo
headman
overheard
some
remarks
which
satisfied
him
that
the
guide
was
leading
them
into
trouble
he
was
quiet
till
they
reached
a
lonely
spot
when
he
came
up
to
dr
livingstone
and
said
that
fellow
is
bad
he
is
taking
us
into
mischief
my
spear
is
sharp
and
there
is
no
one
here
shall
i
cast
him
into
the
long
grass
had
the
doctor
given
the
slightest
token
of
assent
or
even
kept
silence
never
more
would
any
one
have
been
led
by
that
guide
for
in
a
twinkling
he
would
have
been
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
it
was
afterwards
found
that
in
this
case
there
was
no
treachery
at
all
but
a
want
of
knowledge
on
their
part
of
the
language
and
of
the
country
they
asked
to
be
led
to
nyanja
mukulu
or
great
lake
meaning
by
this
lake
shirwa
and
the
guide
took
them
round
a
terribly
rough
piece
of
mountainous
country
gradually
edging
away
towards
a
long
marsh
which
from
the
numbers
of
those
animals
we
had
seen
there
we
had
called
the
elephant
marsh
but
which
was
really
the
place
known
to
him
by
the
name
nyanja
mukulu
or
great
lake
nyanja
or
nyanza
means
generally
a
marsh
lake
river
or
even
a
mere
rivulet
the
party
pushed
on
at
last
without
guides
or
only
with
crazy
ones
for
oddly
enough
they
were
often
under
great
obligations
to
the
madmen
of
the
different
villages
one
of
these
honoured
them
as
they
slept
in
the
open
air
by
dancing
and
singing
at
their
feet
the
whole
night
these
poor
fellows
sympathized
with
the
explorers
probably
in
the
belief
that
they
belonged
to
their
own
class
and
uninfluenced
by
the
general
opinion
of
their
countrymen
they
really
pitied
and
took
kindly
to
the
strangers
and
often
guided
them
faithfully
from
place
to
place
when
no
sane
man
could
be
hired
for
love
or
money
the
bearing
of
the
manganja
at
this
time
was
very
independent
a
striking
contrast
to
the
cringing
attitude
they
afterwards
assumed
when
the
cruel
scourge
of
slavehunting
passed
over
their
country
signals
were
given
from
the
different
villages
by
means
of
drums
and
notes
of
defiance
and
intimidation
were
sounded
in
the
travellers
ears
by
day
and
occasionally
they
were
kept
awake
the
whole
night
in
expectation
of
an
instant
attack
drs
livingstone
and
kirk
were
desirous
that
nothing
should
occur
to
make
the
natives
regard
them
as
enemies
masakasa
on
the
other
hand
was
anxious
to
show
what
he
could
do
in
the
way
of
fighting
them
the
perseverance
of
the
party
was
finally
crowned
with
success
for
on
the
th
of
april
they
discovered
lake
shirwa
a
considerable
body
of
bitter
water
containing
leeches
fish
crocodiles
and
hippopotami
from
having
probably
no
outlet
the
water
is
slightly
brackish
and
it
appears
to
be
deep
with
islands
like
hills
rising
out
of
it
their
point
of
view
was
at
the
base
of
mount
pirimiti
or
mopeupeu
on
its
ssw
side
thence
the
prospect
northwards
ended
in
a
sea
horizon
with
two
small
islands
in
the
distancea
larger
one
resembling
a
hilltop
and
covered
with
trees
rose
more
in
the
foreground
ranges
of
hills
appeared
on
the
east
and
on
the
west
stood
mount
chikala
which
seems
to
be
connected
with
the
great
mountainmass
called
zomba
the
shore
near
which
they
spent
two
nights
was
covered
with
reeds
and
papyrus
wishing
to
obtain
the
latitude
by
the
natural
horizon
they
waded
into
the
water
some
distance
towards
what
was
reported
to
be
a
sandbank
but
were
so
assaulted
by
leeches
they
were
fain
to
retreat
and
a
woman
told
them
that
in
enticing
them
into
the
water
the
men
only
wanted
to
kill
them
the
information
gathered
was
that
this
lake
was
nothing
in
size
compared
to
another
in
the
north
from
which
it
is
separated
by
only
a
tongue
of
land
the
northern
end
of
shirwa
has
not
been
seen
though
it
has
been
passed
the
length
of
the
lake
may
probably
be
or
miles
and
about
broad
the
height
above
the
sea
is
feet
and
the
taste
of
the
water
is
like
a
weak
solution
of
epsom
salts
the
country
around
is
very
beautiful
and
clothed
with
rich
vegetation
and
the
waves
at
the
time
they
were
there
breaking
and
foaming
over
a
rock
on
the
southeastern
side
added
to
the
beauty
of
the
picture
exceedingly
lofty
mountains
perhaps
feet
above
the
sealevel
stand
near
the
eastern
shore
when
their
lofty
steepsided
summits
appear
some
above
some
below
the
clouds
the
scene
is
grand
this
range
is
called
milanje
on
the
west
stands
mount
zomba
feet
in
height
and
some
twenty
miles
long
their
object
being
rather
to
gain
the
confidence
of
the
people
by
degrees
than
to
explore
they
considered
that
they
had
advanced
far
enough
into
the
country
for
one
trip
and
believing
that
they
could
secure
their
end
by
a
repetition
of
their
visit
as
they
had
done
on
the
shire
they
decided
to
return
to
the
vessel
at
dakanamoio
island
but
instead
of
returning
by
the
way
they
came
they
passed
down
southwards
close
by
mount
chiradzuru
among
the
relatives
of
chibisa
and
thence
by
the
pass
zedi
down
to
the
shire
the
kroomen
had
while
we
were
away
cut
a
good
supply
of
wood
for
steaming
and
we
soon
proceeded
down
the
river
the
steamer
reached
tette
on
the
rd
of
june
and
after
undergoing
repairs
proceeded
to
the
kongone
to
receive
provisions
from
one
of
hm
cruisers
we
had
been
very
abundantly
supplied
with
firstrate
stores
but
were
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
a
considerable
portion
of
them
and
had
now
to
bear
the
privation
as
best
we
could
on
the
way
down
we
purchased
a
few
gigantic
cabbages
and
pumpkins
at
a
native
village
below
mazaro
our
dinners
had
usually
consisted
of
but
a
single
course
but
we
were
surprised
the
next
day
by
our
black
cook
from
sierra
leone
bearing
in
a
second
course
what
have
you
got
there
was
asked
in
wonder
a
tart
sir
a
tart
of
what
is
it
made
of
cabbage
sir
as
we
had
no
sugar
and
could
not
make
believe
as
in
the
days
of
boyhood
we
did
not
enjoy
the
feast
that
toms
genius
had
prepared
her
majestys
brig
persian
lieutenant
saumarez
commanding
called
on
her
way
to
the
cape
and
though
somewhat
short
of
provisions
herself
generously
gave
us
all
she
could
spare
we
now
parted
with
our
kroomen
as
from
their
inability
to
march
we
could
not
use
them
in
our
land
journeys
a
crew
was
picked
out
from
the
makololo
who
besides
being
good
travellers
could
cut
wood
work
the
ship
and
required
only
native
food
while
at
the
kongone
it
was
found
necessary
to
beach
the
steamer
for
repairs
she
was
built
of
a
newly
invented
sort
of
steel
plates
only
a
sixteenth
of
an
inch
in
thickness
patented
but
unfortunately
never
tried
before
to
build
an
exploring
ship
of
untried
material
was
a
mistake
some
chemical
action
on
this
preparation
of
steel
caused
a
minute
hole
from
this
point
branches
like
lichens
or
the
little
ragged
stars
we
sometimes
see
in
thawing
ice
radiated
in
all
directions
small
holes
went
through
wherever
a
bend
occurred
in
these
branches
the
bottom
very
soon
became
like
a
sieve
completely
full
of
minute
holes
which
leaked
perpetually
the
engineer
stopped
the
larger
ones
but
the
vessel
was
no
sooner
afloat
than
new
ones
broke
out
the
first
news
of
a
morning
was
commonly
the
unpleasant
announcement
of
another
leak
in
the
forward
compartment
or
in
the
middle
which
was
worse
still
frequent
showers
fell
on
our
way
up
the
zambesi
in
the
beginning
of
august
on
the
th
we
had
upwards
of
three
inches
of
rain
which
large
quantity
more
than
falls
in
any
single
rainy
day
during
the
season
at
tette
we
owed
to
being
near
the
sea
sometimes
the
cabin
was
nearly
flooded
for
in
addition
to
the
leakage
from
below
rain
poured
through
the
roof
and
an
umbrella
had
to
be
used
whenever
we
wished
to
write
the
mode
of
coupling
the
compartments
too
was
a
new
one
and
the
action
of
the
hinder
compartment
on
the
middle
one
pumped
up
the
water
of
the
river
and
sent
it
in
streams
over
the
floor
and
lockers
where
lay
the
cushions
which
did
double
duty
as
chairs
and
beds
in
trying
to
form
an
opinion
of
the
climate
it
must
be
recollected
that
much
of
the
fever
from
which
we
suffered
was
caused
by
sleeping
on
these
wet
cushions
many
of
the
botanical
specimens
laboriously
collected
and
carefully
prepared
by
dr
kirk
were
destroyed
or
double
work
imposed
by
their
accidentally
falling
into
wet
places
in
the
cabin
about
the
middle
of
august
after
cutting
wood
at
shamoara
we
again
steamed
up
the
shire
with
the
intention
of
becoming
better
acquainted
with
the
people
and
making
another
and
longer
journey
on
foot
to
the
north
of
lake
shirwa
in
search
of
lake
nyassa
of
which
we
had
already
received
some
information
under
the
name
nyinyesi
the
stars
the
shire
is
much
narrower
than
the
zambesi
but
deeper
and
more
easily
navigated
it
drains
a
low
and
exceedingly
fertile
valley
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
miles
in
breadth
ranges
of
wooded
hills
bound
this
valley
on
both
sides
for
the
first
twenty
miles
the
hills
on
the
left
bank
are
close
to
the
river
then
comes
morambala
a
detached
mountain
yards
from
the
rivers
brink
which
rises
with
steep
sides
on
the
west
to
feet
in
height
and
is
about
seven
miles
in
length
it
is
wooded
up
to
the
very
top
and
very
beautiful
the
southern
end
seen
from
a
distance
has
a
fine
gradual
slope
and
looks
as
if
it
might
be
of
easy
ascent
but
the
side
which
faces
the
shire
is
steep
and
rocky
especially
in
the
upper
half
a
small
village
peeps
out
about
halfway
up
the
mountain
it
has
a
pure
and
bracing
atmosphere
and
is
perched
above
mosquito
range
the
people
on
the
summit
have
a
very
different
climate
and
vegetation
from
those
of
the
plains
but
they
have
to
spend
a
great
portion
of
their
existence
amidst
white
fleecy
clouds
which
in
the
rainy
season
rest
daily
on
the
top
of
their
favourite
mountain
we
were
kindly
treated
by
these
mountaineers
on
our
first
ascent
before
our
second
they
were
nearly
all
swept
away
by
mariano
dr
kirk
found
upwards
of
thirty
species
of
ferns
on
this
and
other
mountains
and
even
goodsized
treeferns
though
scarcely
a
single
kind
is
to
be
met
with
on
the
plains
lemon
and
orange
trees
grew
wild
and
pineapples
had
been
planted
by
the
people
many
large
hornbills
hawks
monkeys
antelopes
and
rhinoceroses
found
a
home
and
food
among
the
great
trees
round
its
base
a
hot
fountain
boils
up
on
the
plain
near
the
north
end
it
bubbles
out
of
the
earth
clear
as
crystal
at
two
points
or
eyes
a
few
yards
apart
from
each
other
and
sends
off
a
fine
flowing
stream
of
hot
water
the
temperature
was
found
to
be
degrees
fahr
and
it
boiled
an
egg
in
about
the
usual
time
our
guide
threw
in
a
small
branch
to
show
us
how
speedily
the
madseawira
boiling
water
could
kill
the
leaves
unlucky
lizards
and
insects
did
not
seem
to
understand
the
nature
of
a
hotspring
as
many
of
their
remains
were
lying
at
the
bottom
a
large
beetle
had
alighted
on
the
water
and
been
killed
before
it
had
time
to
fold
its
wings
an
incrustation
smelling
of
sulphur
has
been
deposited
by
the
water
on
the
stones
about
a
hundred
feet
from
the
eye
of
the
fountain
the
mud
is
as
hot
as
can
be
borne
by
the
body
in
taking
a
bath
there
it
makes
the
skin
perfectly
clean
and
none
of
the
mud
adheres
it
is
strange
that
the
portuguese
do
not
resort
to
it
for
the
numerous
cutaneous
diseases
with
which
they
are
so
often
afflicted
a
few
clumps
of
the

and
acacia
trees
appear
west
of
morambala
on
the
rich
plain
forming
the
tongue

this
is
a
good
place
for

the

canoe
men
were
afraid
to
sleep
on
it
from
the
idea
of
lions
being
there
they
preferred
to
pass
the
night
on
an
island
some
black
men
who
accompanied
us
as
volunteer
workmen
from
shupanga
called
out
one
evening
that
a
lion
stood
on
the
bank
it
was
very
dark
and
we
could
only
see
two
sparkling
lights
said
to
be
the
lions
eyes
looking
at
us
for
here
as
elsewhere
they
have
a
theory
that
the
lions
eyes
always
flash
fire
at
night
not
being
firefliesas
they
did
not
move
when
a
shot
was
fired
in

were

winding
through
an

for
many
miles
to
the

a
broad
sea

commencing
opposite

bounds
the

on
the
west
after
streaming
through
a
portion
of
this
marsh
we
came
to
a
broad
belt
of
palm
and
other
trees
crossing
the
fine
plain
on
the
right
bank
marks
of
large
game
were
abundant
elephants
had
been
feeding
on
the

nuts
which
have
a
pleasant

taste
and
are
used
as

by

two
pythons
were
observed
coiled
together
among
the
branches
of
a
large
tree
and
were
both
shot
the

where
they
were

a
solitary
buffalo
rushed
out
of
the
conflagration
and
made
a
furious
charge
at
an
active
young
fellow
named
mantlanyane
never
did
his
fleet
limbs
serve
him
better
than
during
the
few
seconds
of
his
fearful
flight
before
the
maddened
animal
when
he
reached
the
bank
and
sprang
into
the
river
the
infuriated
beast
was
scarcely
six
feet
behind
him
towards
evening
after
the
days
labour
in
woodcutting
was
over
some
of
the
men
went
fishing
they
followed
the
common
african
custom
of
agitating
the
water
by
giving
it
a
few
sharp
strokes
with
the
top
of
the
fishingrod
immediately
after
throwing
in
the
line
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
fish
to
the
bait
having
caught
nothing
the
reason
assigned
was
the
same
as
would
have
been
given
in
england
under
like
circumstances
namely
that
the
wind
made
the
fish
cold
and
they
would
not
bite
many
gardens
of
maize
pumpkins
and
tobacco
fringed
the
marshy
banks
as
we
went
on
they

and
raise
a
crop
on

times
flooded
while
the

are
growing
large
quantities
of

are
caught
chiefly
clarias

and
mugil
africanus
they
are
dried
for

as
we
ascended
we
passed
a
deep
stream
about
thirty
yards
wide
flowing
in
from
a
body
of
open
water
several
miles
broad
numbers
of
men
were
busy
at
different
parts
of
it
filling
their
canoes
with
the
lotus
root
called
nyika
which
when
boiled
or
roasted
resembles
our
chestnuts
and
is
extensively
used
in
africa
as

out
of
this

and
by
this

is
evident
from

line
still
to
be
observed
on
the

that
in
ancient

these
were
really

the

are
only
another

we
called
at
the
village
of
chikandakadze
a
female
chief
to
purchase
rice
for
our

but
we
were
now
in
the
blissful
region
where
time
is
absolutely
of
no
account
and
where
men
may
sit
down
and
rest
themselves
when
tired
so
they
requested
us
to
wait
till
next
day
and
they
would
then
sell
us
some
food
as
our
forty
black
men
however
had
nothing
to
cook
for
supper
we
were
obliged
to
steam
on
to
reach
a
village
a
few
miles
above
when
we
meet
those
who
care
not
whether
we
purchase
or
let

alone
or
who
think

to

state
of
eager
competition
which
in
england
wears
out
both
mind
and
body
and
makes
life
bitter
is
here
happily
unknown
the
cultivated

are
mere
dots

to
the
broad

that
the

the
wretched
little
steamer
could
not
carry
all
the
hands
we
needed
so
to
lighten
her
we
put
some
into
the
boats
and
towed
them
astern
in
the
dark
one
of
the
boats
was
capsized
but
all
in
it
except
one
poor
fellow
who
could
not
swim
were
picked
up
his
loss
threw
a
gloom
over
us
all
and
added
to
the
chagrin
we
often
felt
at
having
been
so
illserved
in
our
sorry
craft
next
day
we
arrived
at
the
village
of
mboma
degrees
minutes
seconds
s
where
the
people
raised
large
quantities
of
rice
and
were
eager
traders
the
rice
was
sold
at
wonderfully
low
rates
and
we
could
not
purchase
a
tithe
of
the
food
brought
for
sale
a
native
minstrel
serenaded
us
in
the
evening
playing
several
quaint
tunes
on
a
species
of
one
stringed
fiddle
accompanied
by
wild
but
not
unmusical
songs
he
told
the
makololo
that
he
intended
to
play
all
night
to
induce
us
to
give
him
a
present
the
nights
being
cold
the
thermometer
falling
to
degrees
with
occasional
fogs
he
was
asked
if
he
was
not
afraid
of
perishing
from
cold
but
with
the
genuine
spirit
of
an
italian
organgrinder
he
replied
oh
no
i
shall
spend
the
night
with
my
white
comrades
in
the
big
canoe
i
have
often
heard
of
the
white
men
but
have
never
seen
them
till
now
and
i
must
sing
and
play
well
to
them
a
small
piece
of
cloth
however
bought
him
off
and
he
moved
away
in
good
humour
the
water
of
the
river
was
degrees
at
sunrise
which
was
degrees
warmer
than
the
air
at
the
same
time
and
this
caused
fogs
which
rose
like
steam
off
the
river
when
this
is
the
case
cold
bathing
in
the
mornings
at
this
time
of
the
year
is
improper
for
instead
of
a
glow
on
coming
out
one
is
apt
to
get
a
chill
the
air
being
so
much
colder
than
the

the

the

trap
consists
of
a
beam
five
or
six
feet
long
armed
with
a
spearhead
or
hardwood
spike
covered
with
poison
and
suspended
to
a
forked
pole
by
a
cord
which
coming
down
to
the
path
is
held
by
a
catch
to
be
set

when
the
beast
treads
on
it

they
are

very
numerous
one
got
frightened
by
the
ship
as
she
was
steaming
close
to
the
bank
in
its
eager
hurry
to
escape
it
rushed
on
shore
and
ran
directly
under
a
trap
when
down
came
the
heavy
beam
on
its
back
driving
the
poisoned
spearhead
a
foot
deep
into
its
flesh
in
its
agony
it
plunged
back
into
the
river
to
die
in
a
few
hours
and
afterwards
furnished
a
feast
for
the
natives
the
poison
on
the
spear
head
does
not
affect
the
meat
except
the
part
around
the
wound
and
that
is
thrown
away
in
some
places
the
descending
beam
is
weighted
with
heavy
stones
but
here
the
hard
heavy
wood
is
sufficient
she
is
leaking
worse
than
ever
forward
sir
and
there
is
a
foot
of
water
in
the
hold
was
our
first
salutation
on
the
morning
of
the
th
but
we
have
become
accustomed
to
these
things
now
the
cabinfloor
is
always
wet
and
one
is
obliged
to
mop
up
the
water
many
times
a
day
giving
some
countenance
to
the
native
idea
that
englishmen
live
in
or
on
the
water
and
have
no
houses
but
ships
the
cabin
is
now
a
favourite
breedingplace
for
mosquitoes
and
we
have
to
support
both
the
shipbred
and
shorebred
bloodsuckers
of
which
several
species
show
us
their
irritating
attentions
a
large
brown
sort
called
by
the
portuguese
mansos
tame
flies
straight
to
its
victim
and
goes
to
work
at
once
as
though
it
were
an
invited
guest
some
of
the
small
kinds
carry
uncommonly
sharp
lancets
and
very
potent
poison
what
would
these
insects
eat
if
we
did
not
pass
this
way
becomes
a
natural
question
the
juices
of
plants
and
decaying
vegetable
matter
in
the
mud
probably
form
the
natural
food
of
mosquitoes
and
blood
is
not
necessary
for
their
existence
they
appear
so
commonly
at
malarious
spots
that
their
presence
may
be
taken
as
a
hint
to
man
to
be
off
to
more
healthy
localities
none
appear
on
the
high
lands
on
the
low
lands
they
swarm
in
myriads
the
females
alone
are
furnished
with
the
biting
apparatus
and
their
number
appears
to
be
out
of
all
proportion
in
excess
of
the
males
at
anchor
on
a
still
evening
they
were
excessively
annoying
and
the
sooner
we
took
refuge
under
our
mosquito
curtains
the
better
the
miserable
and
sleepless
night
that
only
one
mosquito
inside
the
curtain
can
cause
is
so
well
known
and
has
been
so
often
described
that
it
is
needless
to
describe
it
here
one
soon
learns
from
experience
that
to
beat
out
the
curtains
thoroughly
before
entering
them
so
that
not
one
of
these
pests
can
possibly
be
harboured
within
is
the
only
safeguard
against
such
severe
trials

ones

and
temper

covered
the

with

we
have
given
the

lies
the
elephant
marsh
or
nyanja
mukulu
which
is
frequented
by
vast
herds
of
these

we
believe
that
we
counted
eight
hundred
elephants
in
sight
at
once
in
the
choice
of
such
a
strong
hold
they
have
shown
their
usual
sagacity
for
no
hunter
can
get
near
them
through
the
swamps
they
now
keep
far
from
the
steamer
but
when
she
first
came
up
we
steamed
into
the
midst
of
a
herd
and
some
were
shot
from
the
ships
deck
a
single
lesson
was
sufficient
to
teach
them
that
the
steamer
was
a
thing
to
be
avoided
and
at
the
first
glimpse
they
are
now
off
two
or
three
miles
to
the
midst
of
the
marsh
which
is
furrowed
in
every
direction
by
wandering
branches
of
the
shire
a
fine
young
elephant
was
here
caught
alive
as
he
was
climbing
up
the
bank
to
follow
his
retreating
dam
when
laid
hold
of
he
screamed
with
so
much
energy
that
to
escape
a
visit
from
the
enraged
mother
we
steamed
off
and
dragged
him
through
the
water
by
the
proboscis
as
the
men
were
holding
his
trunk
over
the
gunwale
monga
a
brave
makololo
elephanthunter
rushed
aft
and
drew
his
knife
across
it
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
peculiar
to
the
chase
the
wound
was
skilfully
sewn
up
and
the
young
animal
soon
became
quite
tame
but
unfortunately
the
breathing
prevented
the
cut
from
healing
and
he
died
in
a
few
days
from
loss
of
blood
had
he
lived
and
had
we
been
able
to
bring
him
home
he
would
have
been
the
first
african
elephant
ever
seen
in
england
the
african
male
elephant
is
from
ten
to
a
little
over
eleven
feet
in
height
and
differs
from
the
asiatic
species
more
particularly
in
the
convex
shape
of
his
forehead
and
the
enormous
size
of
his
ears
in
asia
many
of
the
males
and
all
the
females
are
without
tusks

in
africa
both
sexes
are
provided
with
these
weapons
the
enamel
in
the
molar
teeth
is
arranged
differently
in
the
two
species

an
admirable
provision

teeth

come
up
at
the
part

in

the
wisdom

appear
and
these
push
the
others
along
and
out
at
the
front
end
of
the
jaws
thus
keeping
the
molars
sound
by
renewal
till
the
animal
attains
a
very
great
age
the
tusks
of
animals
from
dry
rocky
countries
are
very
munch
more
dense
and
heavier
than
those
from
wet
and
marshy
districts

the
latter

a
great
forest
of

borassus
aethiopium
it
extends
many
miles
and
at
one
point
comes
close
to
the

the
grey
trunks
and
green
tops
of
this
immense
mass
of
trees
give
a
pleasing
tone
of
colour
to
the
view
the
mountainrange
which
rises
close
behind
the
palms
is
generally
of
a
cheerful
green
and
has
many
trees
with
patches
of
a
lighter
tint
among
them
as
if
spots
of
land
had
once
been
cultivated
the
sharp
angular
rocks
and
dells
on
its
sides
have
the
appearance
of
a
huge
crystal
broken
and
this
is
so
often
the
case
in
africa
that
one
can
guess
pretty
nearly
at
sight
whether
a
range
is
of
the
old
crystalline
rocks
or
not
the
borassus
though
not
an

the
fibrous
pulp
round
the
large

is
of

taste
and
is
eaten
by
men
and
elephants
the
natives
bury
the
nuts
until
the
kernels
begin
to
sprout
when
dug
up
and
broken
the
inside
resembles
coarse
potatoes
and
is
prized
in
times

palm
wine

sura
is
obtained
in

it
is
a

somewhat
like

not
at
all
intoxicating

after
standing

the

off
and
the

pouring

is
caught
in
an
earthen

is
hung
at

is
taken
off

to
open
the

and
make
the

flow
every
time
the

ascends
to
empty
the

are
erected
in

remain
by

being
their
sole

the
portuguese
use
the
palmwine
as
yeast
and
it
makes
bread
so
light
that
it
melts
in
the
mouth
like
froth
beyond
the
marsh
the
country
is
higher
and
has
a
much
larger
population
we
passed
a
long
line
of
temporary
huts
on
a
plain
on
the
right
bank
with
crowds
of
men
and
women
hard
at
work
making
salt
they
obtain
it
by
mixing
the
earth
which
is
here
highly
saline
with
water
in
a
pot
with
a
small
hole
in
it
and
then
evaporating
the
liquid
which
runs
through
in
the
sun
from
the
number
of
women
we
saw
carrying
it
off
in
bags
we
concluded
that
vast
quantities
must
be
made
at
these
works
it
is
worth
observing
that
on
soils
like
this
containing
salt
the
cotton
is
of
larger
and
finer
staple
than
elsewhere
we
saw
large
tracts
of
this
rich
brackish
soil
both
in
the
shire
and
zambesi
valleys
and
hence
probably
seaisland
cotton
would
do
well
a
single
plant
of
it
reared
by
major
sicard
flourished
and
produced
the
long
staple
and
peculiar
tinge
of
this
celebrated
variety
though
planted
only
in
the
street
at
tette
and
there
also
a
salt
efflorescence
appears
probably
from
decomposition
of
the
rock
off
which
the
people
scrape
it
for
use
the
large
village
of
the
chief
mankokwe
occupies
a
site
on
the
right
bank
he
owns
a
number
of
fertile
islands
and
is
said
to
be
the
rundo
or
paramount
chief
of
a
large
district
being
of
an
unhappy
suspicious
disposition
he
would
not
see
us
so
we
thought
it
best
to
move
on
rather
than
spend
time
in
seeking
his
favour
on
the
th
august
we
reached
dakanamoio
island
opposite
the
perpendicular
bluff
on
which
chibisas
village
stands
he
had
gone
with
most
of
his
people
to
live
near
the
zambesi
but
his
headman
was
civil
and
promised
us
guides
and
whatever
else
we
needed
a
few
of
the
men
were
busy
cleaning
sorting
spinning
and
weaving
cotton
this
is
a
common
sight
in
nearly
every
village
and
each
family
appears
to
have
its
patch
of
cotton
as
our
own
ancestors
in
scotland
had
each
his
patch
of
flax
near
sunset
an
immense
flock
of
the
large
species
of
hornbill
buceros
cristatus
came
here
to
roost
on
the
great
trees
which
skirt
the
edge
of
the
cliff
they
leave
early
in
the
morning
often
before
sunrise
for
their
feedingplaces
coming
and
going
in
pairs
they
are
evidently
of
a
loving
disposition
and
strongly
attached
to
each
other
the
male
always
nestling
close
beside
his
mate
a
fine
male
fell
to
the
ground
from
fear
at
the
report
of
dr
kirks
gun
it
was
caught
and
kept
on
board
the
female
did
not
go
off
in
the
mornings
to
feed
with
the
others
but
flew
round
the
ship
anxiously
trying
by
her
plaintive
calls
to
induce
her
beloved
one
to
follow
her
she
came
again
in
the
evenings
to
repeat
the
invitations
the
poor
disconsolate
captive
soon
refused
to
eat
and
in
five
days
died
of
grief
because
he
could
not
have
her
company
no
internal
injury
could
be
detected
after
death
chibisa
and
his
wife
with
a
natural
show
of
parental
feeling
had
told
the
doctor
on
his
previous
visit
that
a
few
years
before
some
of
chisakas
men
had
kidnapped
and
sold
their
little
daughter
and
that
she
was
now
a
slave
to
the
padre
at
tette
on
his
return
to
tette
the
doctor
tried
hard
to
ransom
and
restore
the
girl
to
her
parents
and
offered
twice
the
value
of
a
slave
the
padre
seemed
willing
but
she
could
not
be
found
this
padre
was
better
than
the
average
men
of
the
country
and
being
always
civil
and
obliging
would
probably
have
restored
her
gratuitously
but
she
had
been
sold
it
might
be
to
the
distant
tribe
bazizulu
or
he
could
not
tell
where
custom
had
rendered
his
feelings
callous
and
chibisa
had
to
be
told
that
his
child
would
never
return
it
is
this
callous
state
of
mind
which
leads
some
of
our
own
blood
to
quote
scripture
in
support
of
slavery
if
we
could
afford
to
take
a
backward
step
in
civilization
we
might
find
men
among
ourselves
who
would
in
like
manner
prove
mormonism
or
any
other
enormity
to
be
divine
we
left
the
ship
on
the
th
of
august
for
the
discovery
of
lake
nyassa
our
party
numbered
fortytwo
in
allfour
whites
thirtysix
makololo
and
two
guides
we
did
not
actually
need
so
many
either
for
carriage
or
defence
but
took
them
because
we
believed
that
human
nature
being
everywhere
the
same
blacks
are
as
ready
as
whites
to
take
advantage
of
the
weak
and
are
as
civil
and
respectful
to
the
powerful
we
armed
our
men
with
muskets
which
gave
us
influence
although
it
did
not
add
much
to
our
strength
as
most
of
the
men
had
never
drawn
a
trigger
and
in
any
conflict
would
in
all
probability
have
been
more
dangerous
to
us
than
the
enemy
our
path
crossed
the
valley
in
a
northeasterly
direction
up
the
course
of
a
beautiful
flowing
stream
many
of
the
gardens
had
excellent
cotton
growing
in
them
an
hours
march
brought
us
to
the
foot
of
the
manganja
hills
up
which
lay
the
toilsome
road
the
vegetation
soon
changed
as
we
rose
bamboos
appeared
and
new
trees
and
plants
were
met
with
which
gave
such
incessant
employment
to
dr
kirk
that
he
travelled
the
distance
three
times
over
remarkably
fine
trees
one
of
which
has
oil
yielding
seeds
and
belongs
to
the
mahogany
family
grow
well
in
the
hollows
along
the
rivulet
courses
the
ascent
became
very
fatiguing
and
we
were
glad
of
a
rest
looking
back
from
an
elevation
of
a
thousand
feet
we
beheld
a
lovely
prospect
the
eye
takes
in
at
a
glance
the
valley
beneath
and
the
many
windings
of
its
silver
stream
makubula
or
kubvula
from
the
shady
hillside
where
it
emerges
in
foaming
haste
to
where
it
slowly
glides
into
the
tranquil
shire
then
the
shire
itself
is
seen
for
many
a
mile
above
and
below
chibisas
and
the
great
level
country
beyond
with
its
numerous
green
woods
until
the
prospect
west
and
northwest
is
bounded
far
away
by
masses
of
peaked
and
domeshaped
blue
mountains
that
fringe
the
highlands
of
the
maravi
country
after
a
weary
march
we
halted
at
makolongwi
the
village
of
chitimba
it
stands
in
a
woody
hollow
on
the
first
of
the
three
terraces
of
the
manganja
hills
and
like
all
other
manganja
villages
is
surrounded
by
an
impenetrable
hedge
of
poisonous
euphorbia
this
tree
casts
a
deep
shade
which
would
render
it
difficult
for
bowmen
to
take
aim
at
the
villagers
inside
the
grass
does
not
grow
beneath
it
and
this
may
be
the
reason
why
it
is
so
universally
used
for
when
dry
the
grass
would
readily
convey
fire
to
the
huts
inside
moreover
the
hedge
acts
as
a
fender
to
all
flying
sparks
as
strangers
are
wont
to
do
we
sat
down
under
some
fine
trees
near
the
entrance
of
the
village
a
couple
of
mats
made
of
split
reeds
were
spread
for
the
white
men
to
sit
on
and
the
headman
brought
a
seguati
or
present
of
a
small
goat
and
a
basket
of
meal
the
full
value
in
beads
and
cotton
cloth
was
handed
to
him
in
return
he
measured
the
cloth
doubled
it
and
then
measured
that
again
the
beads
were
scrutinized
he
had
never
seen
beads
of
that
colour
before
and
should
like
to
consult
with
his
comrades
before
accepting
them
and
this
after
repeated
examinations
and
much
anxious
talk
he
concluded
to
do
meal
and
peas
were
then
brought
for
sale
a
fathom
of
blue
cotton
cloth
a
full
dress
for
man
or
woman
was
produced
our
makololo
headman
sininyane
thinking
a
part
of
it
was
enough
for
the
meal
was
proceeding
to
tear
it
when
chitimba
remarked
that
it
was
a
pity
to
cut
such
a
nice
dress
for
his
wife
he
would
rather
bring
more
meal
all
right
said
sininyane
but
look
the
cloth
is
very
wide
so
see
that
the
basket
which
carries
the
meal
be
wide
too
and
add
a
cock
to
make
the
meal
taste
nicely
a
brisk
trade
sprang
up
at
once
each
being
eager
to
obtain
as
fine
things
as
his
neighbourand
all
were
in
good
humour
women
and
girls
began
to
pound
and
grind
meal
and
men
and
boys
chased
the
screaming
fowls
over
the
village
until
they
ran
them
down
in
a
few
hours
the
market
was
completely
glutted
with
every
sort
of
native
food
the
prices
however
rarely
fell
as
they
could
easily
eat
what
was
not
sold
we
slept
under
the
trees
the
air
being
pheasant
and
no
mosquitoes
on
the
hills
according
to
our
usual
plan
of
marching
by
early
dawn
our
camp
was
in
motion
after
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
we
were
on
the
way
the
air
was
deliciously
cool
and
the
path
a
little
easier
than
that
of
yesterday
we
passed
a
number
of
villages
occupying
very
picturesque
spots
among
the
hills
and
in
a
few
hours
gained
the
upper
terrace
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
the
plateau
lies
west
of
the
milanje
mountains
and
its
northeastern
border
slopes
down
to
lake
shirwa
we
were
all
charmed
with
the
splendid
country
and
looked
with
neverfailing
delight
on
its
fertile
plains
its
numerous
hills
and
majestic
mountains
in
some
of
the
passes
we
saw
brambleberries
growing
and
the
many
other
flowers
though
of
great
beauty
did
not
remind
us
of
youth
and
of
home
like
the
ungainly
thorny
bramblebushes
we
were
a
week
in
crossing
the
highlands
in
a
northerly
direction
then
we
descended
into
the
upper
shire
valley
which
is
nearly
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
this
valley
is
wonderfully
fertile
and
supports
a
large
population
after
leaving
the
somewhat
flattopped
southern
portion
the
most
prominent
mountain
of
the
zomba
range
is
njongone
which
has
a
fine
stream
running
past
its
northern
base
we
were
detained
at
the
end
of
the
chain
some
days
by
one
of
our
companions
being
laid
up
with
fever
one
night
we
were
suddenly
aroused
by
buffaloes
rushing
close
by
the
sickbed
we
were
encamped
by
a
wood
on
the
border
of
a
marsh
but
our
patient
soon
recovered
notwithstanding
the
unfavourable
situation
and
the
poor
accommodation
the
manganja
country
is
delightfully
well
watered
the
clear
cool
gushing
streams
are
very
numerous
once
we
passed
seven
fine
brooks
and
a
spring
in
a
single
hour
and
this
too
near
the
close
of
the
dry
season
mount
zomba
which
is
twenty
miles
long
and
from
to
feet
high
has
a
beautiful
stream
flowing
through
a
verdant
valley
on
its
summit
and
running
away
down
into
lake
shirwa
the
highlands
are
well
wooded
and
many
trees
admirable
for
their
height
and
timber
grow
on
the
various
watercourses
is
this
country
good
for
cattle
we
inquired
of
a
makololo
herdsman
whose
occupation
had
given
him
skill
in
pasturage
truly
he
replied
do
you
not
see
abundance
of
those
grasses
which
the
cattle
love
and
get
fat
upon
yet
the
people
have
but
few
goats
and
fewer
sheep
with
the
exception
of
an
occasional
leopard
there
are
no
beasts
of
prey
to
disturb
domestic
animals
wool
sheep
would
without
doubt
thrive
on
these
highlands
part
of
the
upper
shire
valley
has
a
lady
paramount
named
nyango
and
in
her
dominions
women
rank
higher
and
receive
more
respectful
treatment
than
their
sisters
on
the
hills
the
hill
chief
mongazi
called
his
wife
to
take
charge
of
a
present
we
had
given
him
she
dropped
down
on
her
knees
clapping
her
hands
in
reverence
before
and
after
receiving
our
presents
from
his
lordly
hands
it
was
painful
to
see
the
abject
manner
in
which
the
women
of
the
hill
tribes
knelt
beside
the
path
as
we
passed
but
a
great
difference
took
place
when
we
got
into
nyangos
country
on
entering
a
village
we
proceeded
as
all
strangers
do
at
once
to
the
boalo
mats
of
split
reeds
or
bamboo
were
usually
spread
for
us
to
sit
on
our
guides
then
told
the
men
who
might
be
there
who
we
were
whence
we
had
come
whither
we
wanted
to
go
and
what
were
our
objects
this
information
was
duly
carried
to
the
chief
who
if
a
sensible
man
came
at
once
but
if
he
happened
to
be
timid
and
suspicious
waited
until
he
had
used
divination
and
his
warriors
had
time
to
come
in
from
outlying
hamlets
when
he
makes
his
appearance
all
the
people
begin
to
clap
their
hands
in
unison
and
continue
doing
so
till
he
sits
down
opposite
to
us
his
counsellors
take
their
places
beside
him
he
makes
a
remark
or
two
and
is
then
silent
for
a
few
seconds
our
guides
then
sit
down
in
front
of
the
chief
and
his
counsellors
and
both
parties
lean
forward
looking
earnestly
at
each
other
the
chief
repeats
a
word
such
as
ambuiatu
our
father
or
masteror
moio
life
and
all
clap
their
hands
another
word
is
followed
by
two
claps
a
third
by
still
more
clapping
when
each
touches
the
ground
with
both
hands
placed
together
then
all
rise
and
lean
forward
with
measured
clap
and
sit
down
again
with
clap
clap
clap
fainter
and
still
fainter
till
the
last
dies
away
or
is
brought
to
an
end
by
a
smart
loud
clap
from
the
chief
they
keep
perfect
time
in
this
species
of
court
etiquette
our
guides
now
tell
the
chief
often
in
blank
verse
all
they
have
already
told
his
people
with
the
addition
perhaps
of
their
own
suspicions
of
the
visitors
he
asks
some
questions
and
then
converses
with
us
through
the
guides
direct
communication
between
the
chief
and
the
head
of
the
stranger
party
is
not
customary
in
approaching
they
often
ask
who
is
the
spokesman
and
the
spokesman
of
the
chief
addresses
the
person
indicated
exclusively
there
is
no
lack
of
punctilious
good
manners
the
accustomed
presents
are
exchanged
with
civil
ceremoniousness
until
our
men
wearied
and
hungry
call
out
english
do
not
buy
slaves
they
buy
food
and
then
the
people
bring
meal
maize
fowls
batatas
yams
beans
beer
for
sale
the
manganja
are
an
industrious
race
and
in
addition
to
working
in
iron
cotton
and
basketmaking
they
cultivate
the
soil
extensively
all
the
people
of
a
village
turn
out
to
labour
in
the
fields
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
to
see
men
women
and
children
hard
at
work
with
the
baby
lying
close
by
beneath
a
shady
bush
when
a
new
piece
of
woodland
is
to
be
cleared
they
proceed
exactly
as
farmers
do
in
america
the
trees
are
cut
down
with
their
little
axes
of
soft
native
iron
trunks
and
branches
are
piled
up
and
burnt
and
the
ashes
spread
on
the
soil
the
corn
is
planted
among
the
standing
stumps
which
are
left
to
rot
if
grass
land
is
to
be
brought
under
cultivation
as
much
tall
grass
as
the
labourer
can
conveniently
lay
hold
of
is
collected
together
and
tied
into
a
knot
he
then
strikes
his
hoe
round
the
tufts
to
sever
the
roots
and
leaving
all
standing
proceeds
until
the
whole
ground
assumes
the
appearance
of
a
field
covered
with
little
shocks
of
corn
in
harvest
a
short
time
before
the
rains
begin
these
grass
shocks
are
collected
in
small
heaps
covered
with
earth
and
burnt
the
ashes
and
burnt
soil
being
used
to
fertilize
the
ground
large
crops
of
the
mapira
or
egyptian
dura
holcus
sorghum
are
raised
with
millet
beans
and
groundnuts
also
patches
of
yams
rice
pumpkins
cucumbers
cassava
sweet
potatoes
tobacco
and
hemp
or
bang
cannabis
setiva
maize
is
grown
all
the
year
round
cotton
is
cultivated
at
almost
every
village
three
varieties
of
cotton
have
been
found
in
the
country
namely
two
foreign
and
one
native
the
tonje
manga
or
foreign
cotton
the
name
showing
that
it
has
been
introduced
is
of
excellent
quality
and
considered
at
manchester
to
be
nearly
equal
to
the
best
new
orleans
it
is
perennial
but
requires
replanting
once
in
three
years
a
considerable
amount
of
this
variety
is
grown
in
the
upper
and
lower
shire
valleys
every
family
of
any
importance
owns
a
cotton
patch
which
from
the
entire
absence
of
weeds
seemed
to
be
carefully
cultivated
most
were
small
none
seen
on
this
journey
exceeding
half
an
acre
but
on
the
former
trip
some
were
observed
of
more
than
twice
that
size
the
tonje
cadja
or
indigenous
cotton
is
of
shorter
staple
and
feels
in
the
hand
like
wool
this
kind
has
to
be
planted
every
season
in
the
highlands
yet
because
it
makes
stronger
cloth
many
of
the
people
prefer
it
to
the
foreign
cotton
the
third
variety
is
not
found
here
it
was
remarked
to
a
number
of
men
near
the
shire
lakelet
a
little
further
on
towards
nyassa
you
should
plant
plenty
of
cotton
and
probably
the
english
will
come
and
buy
it
truly
replied
a
fartravelled
babisa
trader
to
his
fellows
the
country
is
full
of
cotton
and
if
these
people
come
to
buy
they
will
enrich
us
our
own
observation
on
the
cotton
cultivated
convinced
us
that
this
was
no
empty
flourish
but
a
fact
everywhere
we
met
with
it
and
scarcely
ever
entered
a
village
without
finding
a
number
of
men
cleaning
spinning
and
weaving
it
is
first
carefully
separated
from
the
seed
by
the
fingers
or
by
an
iron
roller
on
a
little
block
of
wood
and
rove
out
into
long
soft
bands
without
twist
then
it
receives
its
first
twist
on
the
spindle
and
becomes
about
the
thickness
of
coarse
candlewick
after
being
taken
off
and
wound
into
a
large
ball
it
is
given
the
final
hard
twist
and
spun
into
a
firm
cop
on
the
spindle
again
all
the
processes
being
painfully
slow
iron
ore
is
dug
out
of
the
hills
and
its
manufacture
is
the
staple
trade
of
the
southern
highlands
each
village
has
its
smeltinghouse
its
charcoalburners
and
blacksmiths
they
make
good
axes
spears
needles
arrowheads
bracelets
and
anklets
which
considering
the
entire
absence
of
machinery
are
sold
at
surprisingly
low
rates
a
hoe
over
two
pounds
in
weight
is
exchanged
for
calico
of
about
the
value
of
fourpence
in
villages
near
lake
shirwa
and
elsewhere
the
inhabitants
enter
pretty
largely
into
the
manufacture
of
crockery
or
pottery
making
by
hand
all
sorts
of
cooking
water
and
grain
pots
which
they
ornament
with
plumbago
found
in
the
hills
some
find
employment
in
weaving
neat
baskets
from
split
bamboos
and
others
collect
the
fibre
of
the
buaze
which
grows
abundantly
on
the
hills
and
make
it
into
fishnets
these
they
either
use
themselves
or
exchange
with
the
fishermen
on
the
river
or
lakes
for
dried
fish
and
salt
a
great
deal
of
native
trade
is
carried
on
between
the
villages
by
means
of
barter
in
tobacco
salt
dried
fish
skins
and
iron
many
of
the
men
are
intelligentlooking
with
wellshaped
heads
agreeable
faces
and
high
foreheads
we
soon
learned
to
forget
colour
and
we
frequently
saw
countenances
resembling
those
of
white
people
we
had
known
in
england
which
brought
back
the
looks
of
forgotten
ones
vividly
before
the
mind
the
men
take
a
good
deal
of
pride
in
the
arrangement
of
their
hair
the
varieties
of
style
are
endless
one
trains
his
long
locks
till
they
take
the
admired
form
of
the
buffalos
horns
others
prefer
to
let
their
hair
hang
in
a
thick
coil
down
their
backs
like
that
animals
tail
while
another
wears
it
in
twisted
cords
which
stiffened
by
fillets
of
the
inner
bark
of
a
tree
wound
spirally
round
each
curl
radiate
from
the
head
in
all
directions
some
have
it
hanging
all
round
the
shoulders
in
large
masses
others
shave
it
off
altogether
many
shave
part
of
it
into
ornamental
figures
in
which
the
fancy
of
the
barber
crops
out
conspicuously
about
as
many
dandies
run
to
seed
among
the
blacks
as
among
the
whites
the
man
ganja
adorn
their
bodies
extravagantly
wearing
rings
on
their
fingers
and
thumbs
besides
throatlets
bracelets
and
anklets
of
brass
copper
or
iron
but
the
most
wonderful
of
ornaments
if
such
it
may
be
called
is
the
pelele
or
upperlip
ring
of
the
women
the
middle
of
the
upper
lip
of
the
girls
is
pierced
close
to
the
septum
of
the
nose
and
a
small
pin
inserted
to
prevent
the
puncture
closing
up
after
it
has
healed
the
pin
is
taken
out
and
a
larger
one
is
pressed
into
its
place
and
so
on
successively
for
weeks
and
months
and
years
the
process
of
increasing
the
size
of
the
lip
goes
on
till
its
capacity
becomes
so
great
that
a
ring
of
two
inches
diameter
can
be
introduced
with
ease
all
the
highland
women
wear
the
pelele
and
it
is
common
on
the
upper
and
lower
shire
the
poorer
classes
make
them
of
hollow
or
of
solid
bamboo
but
the
wealthier
of
ivory
or
tin
the
tin
pelele
is
often
made
in
the
form
of
a
small
dish
the
ivory
one
is
not
unlike
a
napkinring
no
woman
ever
appears
in
public
without
the
pelele
except
in
times
of
mourning
for
the
dead
it
is
frightfully
ugly
to
see
the
upper
lip
projecting
two
inches
beyond
the
tip
of
the
nose
when
an
old
wearer
of
a
hollow
bamboo
ring
smiles
by
the
action
of
the
muscles
of
the
cheeks
the
ring
and
lip
outside
it
are
dragged
back
and
thrown
above
the
eyebrows
the
nose
is
seen
through
the
middle
of
the
ring
amid
the
exposed
teeth
show
how
carefully
they
have
been
chipped
to
look
like
those
of
a
cat
or
crocodile
the
pelele
of
an
old
lady
chikanda
kadze
a
chieftainess
about
twenty
miles
north
of
morambala
hung
down
below
her
chin
with
of
course
a
piece
of
the
upper
lip
around
its
border
the
labial
letters
cannot
be
properly
pronounced
but
the
under
lip
has
to
do
its
best
for
them
against
the
upper
teeth
and
gum
tell
them
it
makes
them
ugly
they
had
better
throw
it
away
they
reply
kodi
really
it
is
the
fashion
how
this
hideous
fashion
originated
is
an
enigma
can
thick
lips
ever
have
been
thought
beautiful
and
this
mode
of
artificial
enlargement
resorted
to
in
consequence
the
constant
twiddling
of
the
pelele
with
the
tongue
by
the
younger
women
suggested
the
irreverent
idea
that
it
might
have
been
invented
to
give
safe
employment
to
that
little
member
why
do
the
women
wear
these
things
we
inquired
of
the
old
chief
chinsunse
evidently
surprised
at
such
a
stupid
question
he
replied
for
beauty
to
be
sure
men
have
beards
and
whiskers
women
have
none
and
what
kind
of
creature
would
a
woman
be
without
whiskers
and
without
the
pelele
she
would
have
a
mouth
like
a
man
and
no
beard
ha
ha
ha
afterwards
on
the
rovuma
we
found
men
wearing
the
pelele
as
well
as
women
an
idea
suggested
itself
on
seeing
the
effects
of
the
slight
but
constant
pressure
exerted
on
the
upper
gum
and
front
teeth
of
which
our
medical
brethren
will
judge
the
value
in
many
cases
the
upper
front
teeth
instead
of
the
natural
curve
outwards
which
the
row
presents
had
been
pressed
so
as
to
appear
as
if
the
line
of
alveoli
in
which
they
were
planted
had
an
inward
curve
as
this
was
produced
by
the
slight
pressure
of
the
pelele
backwards
persons
with
too
prominent
teeth
might
by
slight
but
longcontinued
pressure
by
some
appliance
only
as
elastic
as
the
lip
have
the
upper
gum
and
teeth
depressed
especially
in
youth
more
easily
than
is
usually
imagined
the
pressure
should
be
applied
to
the
upper
gum
more
than
to
the
teeth
the
manganja
are
not
a
sober
people
they
brew
large
quantities
of
beer
and
like
it
well
having
no
hops
or
other
means
of
checking
fermentation
they
are
obliged
to
drink
the
whole
brew
in
a
few
days
or
it
becomes
unfit
for
use
great
merrymakings
take
place
on
these
occasions
and
drinking
drumming
and
dancing
continue
day
and
night
till
the
beer
is
gone
in
crossing
the
hills
we
sometimes
found
whole
villages
enjoying
this
kind
of
mirth
the
veteran
traveller
of
the
party
remarked
that
he
had
not
seen
so
much
drunkenness
during
all
the
sixteen
years
he
had
spent
in
africa
as
we
entered
a
village
one
afternoon
not
a
man
was
to
be
seen
but
some
women
were
drinking
beer
under
a
tree
in
a
few
moments
the
native
doctor
one
of
the
innocents
nobodys
enemy
but
his
own
staggered
out
of
a
hut
with
his
cuppinghorn
dangling
from
his
neck
and
began
to
scold
us
for
a
breach
of
etiquette
is
this
the
way
to
come
into
a
mans
village
without
sending
him
word
that
you
are
coming
our
men
soon
pacified
the
fuddled
but
goodhumoured
medico
who
entering
his
beercellar
called
on
two
of
them
to
help
him
to
carry
out
a
huge
pot
of
beer
which
he
generously
presented
to
us
while
the
medical
practitioner
was
thus
hospitably
employed
the
chief
awoke
in
a
fright
and
shouted
to
the
women
to
run
away
or
they
would
all
be
killed
the
ladies
laughed
at
the
idea
of
their
being
able
to
run
away
and
remained
beside
the
beerpots
we
selected
a
spot
for
our
camp
our
men
cooked
the
dinner
as
usual
and
we
were
quietly
eating
it
when
scores
of
armed
men
streaming
with
perspiration
came
pouring
into
the
village
they
looked
at
us
then
at
each
other
and
turning
to
the
chief
upbraided
him
for
so
needlessly
sending
for
them
these
people
are
peaceable
they
do
not
hurt
you
you
are
killed
with
beer
so
saying
they
returned
to
their
homes
native
beer
has
a
pinkish
colour
and
the
consistency
of
gruel
the
grain
is
made
to
vegetate
dried
in
the
sun
pounded
into
meal
and
gently
boiled
when
only
a
day
or
two
old
the
beer
is
sweet
with
a
slight
degree
of
acidity
which
renders
it
a
most
grateful
beverage
in
a
hot
climate
or
when
fever
begets
a
sore
craving
for
acid
drinks
a
single
draught
of
it
satisfies
this
craving
at
once
only
by
deep
and
longcontinued
potations
can
intoxication
be
produced
the
grain
being
in
a
minutely
divided
state
it
is
a
good
way
of
consuming
it
and
the
decoction
is
very
nutritious

of

is
exchanged
for
an
equalsized
pot
full

a
present

this
beer
so
refreshing
to
our
dark
comrades
was
brought
to
us
in
nearly
every
village
beerdrinking
does
not
appear
to
produce
any
disease
or
to
shorten
life
on

never
before
did
we
see
so
many
old
grey
headed
men
and
women
leaning
on
their
staves
they
came
with
the
others
to
see
the
white
men
the
aged
chief
muata
manga
could
hardly
have
been
less
than
ninety
years
of
age
his
venerable
appearance
struck
the
makololo
he
is
an
old
man
said
they
a
very
old
man
his
skin
hangs
in
wrinkles
just
like
that
on
elephants
hips
did
you
never
he
was
asked
have
a
fit
of
travelling
come
over
you
a
desire
to
see
other
lands
and
people
no
he
had
never
felt
that
and
had
never
been
far
from
home
in
his
life
for
long
life
they
are
not
indebted
to
frequent
ablutions
an
old
man
told
us
that
he
remembered
to
have
washed
once
in
his
life
but
it
was
so
long
since
that
he
had
forgotten
how
it
felt
why
do
you
wash
asked
chinsunses
women
of
the
makololo
our
men
never
do
the
superstitious
ordeal
by
drinking
the
poisonous
muave
obtains
credit
here
and
when
a
person
is
suspected
of
crime
this
ordeal
is
resorted
to
if
the
stomach
rejects
the
poison
the
accused
is
pronounced
innocent
but
if
it
is
retained
guilt
is
believed
to
be
demonstrated
their
faith
is
so
firm
in
its
discriminating
power
that
the
supposed
criminal
offers
of
his
own
accord
to
drink
it
and
even
chiefs
are
not
exempted
chibisa
relying
on
its
efficacy
drank
it
several
times
in
order
to
vindicate
his
character
when
asserting
that
all
his
wars
had
been
just
it
was
hinted
that
as
every
chief
had
the
same
tale
of
innocence
to
tell
we
ought
to
suspend
our
judgment
if
you
doubt
my
word
said
he
give
me
the
muave
to
drink
a
chief
at
the
foot
of
mount
zomba
successfully
went
through
the
ordeal
the
day
we
reached
his
village
and
his
people
manifested
their
joy
at
his
deliverance
by
drinking
beer
dancing
and
drumming
for
two
days
and
nights
it
is
possible
that
the
native
doctor
who
mixes
the
ingredients
of
the
poisoned
bowl
may
be
able
to
save
those
whom
he
considers
innocent
but
it
is
difficult
to
get
the
natives
to
speak
about
the
matter
and
no
one
is
willing
to
tell
what
the
muave
poison
consists
of
we
have
been
shown
trees
said
to
be
used
but
had
always
reason
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
our
informants
we
once
found
a
tree
in
a
village
with
many
pieces
of
the
bark
chipped
off
closely
allied
to
the
tangena
or
tanghina
the

but
we
could
not
ascertain
any
particulars
about
it
death

those
found
guilty
of
witchcraft
by
the
muave
the
women
wail
for
the

two
days
seated
on
the
ground
they
chant
a
few
plaintive
words
and
end
each
verse
with
the
prolonged
sound
of
aa
or
oo
or
eaeaeaa
whatever
beer
is
in
the

of
the

is
poured
out
on

with
the

and
all
cooking
and

pots
are
broken
as
being
of
no
further

both

of
mourning

these
consist
of
narrow
strips
of
the
palmleaf
wound
round
the

the
arms

and
worn
till

and
about
a
days
march
distant
from

we
were
told
that
no

had
ever
been
heard
of
there
that
the
river
shire
stretched
on
as
we
saw
it
now
to
a
distance
of
two
months
and
then
came
out
from
between
perpendicular
rocks
which
towered
almost
to
the
skies
our
men
looked
blank
at
this
piece
of
news
and
said
let
us
go
back
to
the
ship
it
is
of
no
use

to
find
the

we
shall
go
and
see
those

said
the

and
when

replied
masakasa
you
will
just
want
to
see
something

there
is
a

for
all
their
denying

it

masakasa

unbounded
faith
in
whatever
was
in

went
and
scolded
the
natives
for
telling
him
an
untruth
there
is
a
lake
said
he
for
how
could
the
white
men
know
about
it
in
a
book
if
it
did
not
exist
they
then
admitted
that
there
was
a
lake
a
few
miles
off
subsequent
inquiries
make
it
probable
that
the
story
of
the
perpendicular
rocks
may
have
had
reference
to
a
fissure
known
to
both
natives
and
arabs
in
the
northeastern
portion
of
the
lake
the
walls
rise
so
high
that
the
path
along
the
bottom
is
said
to
be
underground
it
is
probably
a
crack
similar
to
that
which
made
the
victoria
falls
and
formed
the
shire
valley
the
chief
brought
a
small
present
of
meal
in
the
evening
and
sat
with
us
for
a
few
minutes
on
leaving
us
he
said
that
he
wished
we
might
sleep
well
scarce
had
he
gone
when
a
wild
sad
cry
arose
from
the
river
followed
by
the
shrieking
of
women
a
crocodile
had
carried
off
his
principal
wife
as
she
was
bathing
the
makololo
snatched
up
their
arms
and
rushed
to
the
bank
but
it
was
too
late
she
was
gone
the
wailing
of
the
women
continued
all
night
and
next
morning
we
met
others
coming
to
the
village
to
join
in
the
general
mourning
their
grief
was
evidently
heartfelt
as
we
saw
the
tears
coursing
down
their
cheeks
in
reporting
this
misfortune
to
his
neighbours
muanamoesi
said
that
white
men
came
to
his
village
washed
themselves
at
the
place
where
his
wife
drew
water
and
bathed
rubbed
themselves
with
a
white
medicine
soap
and
his
wife
having
gone
to
bathe
afterwards
was
taken
by
a
crocodile
he
did
not
know
whether
in
consequence
of
the
medicine
used
or
not
this
we
could
not
find
fault
with
on
our
return
we
were
viewed
with
awe
and
all
the
men
fled
at
our
approach
the
women
remained
and
this
elicited
the
remark
from
our
men
the
women
have
the
advantage
of
men
in
not
needing
to
dread
the
spear
the
practice
of
bathing
which
our
first
contact
with
chinsunses
people
led
us
to
believe
was
unknown
to
the
natives
we
afterwards
found
to
be
common
in
other
parts
of
the
manganja
country
we
discovered

little
before

of

at

the

is
about
twelve
miles
wide
there
are

on

sides
of

but
the
haze
from
burning
grass
prevented
us
at
the
time
from
seeing
far
a
long
time
after
our
return
from

we
received
a
letter
from

commanding

with
the
information
that
dr
roscher
an
enterprising
german
who
unfortunately
lost
his
life
in
his
zeal
for
exploration
had
also
reached
the
lake
but
on
the
th
november
following
our
discovery
and
on
his
arrival
had
been
informed
by
the
natives
that
a
party
of
white
men
were
at
the
southern
extremity
on
comparing
dates
th
september
and
th
november
we
were
about
two
months
before
dr
roscher
it
is
not
known
where
dr
roscher
first
saw
its
waters
as
the
exact
position
of
nusseewa
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
where
he
lived
some
time
is
unknown
he
was
three
days
northeast
of
nusseewa
and
on
the
arab
road
back
to
the
usual

of

when
he
was
murdered
the
murderers
were
seized
by
one
of

sent
to

executed

is
said
to
have
kept

to
himself

man
called

hearing
that
we
were
sitting
under

came
and
kindly
invited
us
to

he
took
us
to

into
the
form
of
a
gigantic
armchair
without
the
seat
four
of
us
slept
in
the
space
betwixt
its
arms
mosauka
brought
us
a
present
of
a
goat
and
basket
of
meal
to
comfort
our
hearts
he
told
us
that
a
large
slave
party
led
by
arabs
were
encamped
close
by
they
had
been
up
to
cazembes
country
the
past
year
and
were
on
their
way
back
with
plenty
of
slaves
ivory
and
malachite
in
a
few
minutes
half
a
dozen
of
the
leaders
came
over
to
see
us
they
were
armed
with
long
muskets
and
to
our
mind
were
a
villanouslooking
lot
they
evidently
thought
the
same
of
us
for
they
offered
several
young
children
for
sale
but
when
told
that
we
were
english
showed
signs
of
fear
and
decamped
during
the
night
on
our
return
to
the
kongone
we
found
that
hms
lynx
had
caught
some
of
these
very
slaves
in
a
dhow
for
a
woman
told
us
she
first
saw
us
at
mosaukas
and
that
the
arabs
had
fled
for
fear
of
an
uncanny
sort
of
basungu
this
is
one
of
the
great
slavepaths
from
the
interior
others
cross
the
shire
a
little
below
and
some
on
the
lake
itself
we
might
have
released
these
slaves
but
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
afterwards
on
meeting
men
led
in
slavesticks
the
doctor
had
to
bear
the
reproaches
of
the
makololo
who
never
slave
ay
you
call
us
bad
but
are
we
yellowhearted
like
these
fellowswhy
wont
you
let
us
choke
them
to
liberate
and
leave
them
would
have
done
but
little
good
as
the
people
of
the
surrounding
villages
would
soon
have
seized
them
and
have
sold
them
again
into
slavery
the
manganja
chiefs
sell
their
own
people
for
we
met
ajawa
and
slavedealers
in
several
highland
villages
who
had
certainly
been
encouraged
to
come
among
them
for
slaves
the
chiefs
always
seemed
ashamed
of
the
traffic
and
tried
to
excuse
themselves
we
do
not
sell
many
and
only
those
who
have
committed
crimes
as
a
rule
the
regular
trade
is
supplied
by
the
low
and
criminal
classes
and
hence
the
ugliness
of
slaves
others
are
probably
sold
besides
criminals
as
on
the
accusation
of
witchcraft
friendless
orphans
also
sometimes
disappear
suddenly
and
no
one
inquires
what
has
become
of
them
the
temptation
to
sell
their
people
is
peculiarly
great
as
there
is
but
little
ivory
on
the
hills
and
often
the
chief
has
nothing
but
human
flesh
with
which
to
buy
foreign
goods
the
ajawa
offer
cloth
brass
rings
pottery
and
sometimes
handsome
young
women
and
agree
to
take
the
trouble
of
carrying
off
by
night
all
those
whom
the
chief
may
point
out
to
them
they
give
four
yards
of
cotton
cloth
for
a
man
three
for
a
woman
and
two
for
a
boy
or
girl
to
be
taken
to
the
portuguese
at
mozambique
iboe
and
quillimane
the
manganja
were
more
suspicious
and
less
hospitable
than
the
tribes
on
the
zambesi
they
were
slow
to
believe
that
our
object
in
coming
into
their
country
was
really
what
we
professed
it
to
be
they
naturally
judge
us
by
the
motives
which
govern
themselves
a
chief
in
the
upper
shire
valley
whose
scared
looks
led
our
men
to
christen
him
kitlabolawa
i
shall
be
killed
remarked
that
parties
had
come
before
with
as
plausible
a
story
as
ours
and
after
a
few
days
had
jumped
up
and
carried
off
a
number
of
his
people
as
slaves
we
were
not
allowed
to
enter
some
of
the
villages
in
the
valley
nor
would
the
inhabitants
even
sell
us
food
zimikas
men
for
instance
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
euphorbia
hedge
and
declared
we
should
not
pass
in
we
sat
down
under
a
tree
close
by
a
young
fellow
made
an
angry
oration
dancing
from
side
to
side
with
his
bow
and
poisoned
arrows
and
gesticulating
fiercely
in
our
faces
he
was
stopped
in
the
middle
of
his
harangue
by
an
old
man
who
ordered
him
to
sit
down
and
not
talk
to
strangers
in
that
way
he
obeyed
reluctantly
scowling
defiance
and
thrusting
out
his
large
lips
very
significantly
the
women
were
observed
leaving
the
village
and
suspecting
that
mischief
might
ensue
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
to
the
great
disgust
of
our
men
they
were
very
angry
with
the
natives
for
their
want
of
hospitality
to
strangers
and
with
us
because
we
would
not
allow
them
to
give
the
things
a
thrashing
this
is
what
comes
of
going
with
white
men
they
growled
out
had
we
been
with
our
own
chief
we
should
have
eaten
their
goats
tonight
and
had
some
of
themselves
to
carry
the
bundles
for
us
tomorrow
on
our
return
by
a
path
which
left
his
village
on
our
right
zimika
sent
to
apologize
saying
that
he
was
ill
and
in
another
village
at
the
time
it
was
not
by
his
orders
we
were
sent
away
his
men
did
not
know
that
we
were
a
party
wishing
the
land
to
dwell
in
peace
we
were
not
able
when
hastening
back
to
the
men
left
in
the
ship
to
remain
in
the
villages
belonging
to
this
chief
but
the
people
came
after
us
with
things
for
sale
and
invited
us
to
stop
and
spend
the
night
with
them
urging
are
we
to
have
it
said
that
white
people
passed
through
our
country
and
we
did
not
see
them
we
rested
by
a
rivulet
to
gratify
these
sightseers
we
appear
to
them
to
be
red
rather
than
white
and
though
light
colour
is
admired
among
themselves
our
clothing
renders
us
uncouth
in
aspect
blue
eyes
appear
savage
and
a
red
beard
hideous
from
the
numbers
of
aged
persons
we
saw
on
the
highlands
and
the
increase
of
mental
and
physical
vigour
we
experienced
on
our
ascent
from
the
lowlands
we
inferred
that
the
climate
was
salubrious
and
that
our
countrymen
might
there
enjoy
good
health
and
also
be
of
signal
benefit
by
leading
the
multitude
of
industrious
inhabitants
to
cultivate
cotton
buaze
sugar
and
other
valuable
produce
to
exchange
for
goods
of
european
manufacture
at
the
same
time
teaching
them
by
precept
and
example
the
great
truths
of
our
holy
religion
our
stay
at
the
lake
was
necessarily
short
we
had
found
that
the
best
plan
for
allaying
any
suspicions
that
might
arise
in
the
minds
of
a
people
accustomed
only
to
slavetraders
was
to
pay
a
hasty
visit
and
then
leave
for
a
while
and
allow
the
conviction
to
form
among
the
people
that
though
our
course
of
action
was
so
different
from
that
of
others
we
were
not
dangerous
but
rather
disposed
to
be
friendly
we
had
also
a
party
at
the
vessel
and
any
indiscretion
on
their
part
might
have
proved
fatal
to
the
character
of
the
expedition
the
trade
of
cazembe
and
katangas
country
and
of
other
parts
of
the
interior
crosses
nyassa
and
the
shire
on
its
way
to
the
arab
port
kilwa
and
the
portuguese
ports
of
iboe
and
mozambique
at
present
slaves
ivory
malachite
and
copper
ornaments
are
the
only
articles
of
commerce
according
to
information
collected
by
colonel
rigby
at
zanzibar
and
from
other
sources
nearly
all
the
slaves
shipped
from
the
abovementioned
ports
come
from
the
nyassa
district
by
means
of
a
small
steamer
purchasing
the
ivory
of
the
lake
and
river
above
the
cataracts
which
together
have
a
shoreline
of
at
least
miles
the
slavetrade
in
this
quarter
would
be
rendered
unprofitablefor
it
is
only
by
the
ivory
being
carried
by
the
slaves
that
the
latter
do
not
eat
up
all
the
profits
of
a
trip
an
influence
would
be
exerted
over
an
enormous
area
of
country
for
the
mazitu
about
the
north
end
of
the
lake
will
not
allow
slavetraders
to
pass
round
that
way
through
their
country
they
would
be
most
efficient
allies
to
the
english
and
might
themselves
be
benefited
by
more
intercourse
as
things
are
now
the
native
traders
in
ivory
and
malachite
have
to
submit
to
heavy
exactions
and
if
we
could
give
them
the
same
prices
which
they
at
present
get
after
carrying
their
merchandise
miles
beyond
this
to
the
coast
it
might
induce
them
to
return
without
going
further
it
is
only
by
cutting
off
the
supplies
in
the
interior
that
we
can
crush
the
slavetrade
on
the
coast
the
plan
proposed
would
stop
the
slavetrade
from
the
zambesi
on
one
side
and
kilwa
on
the
other
and
would
leave
beyond
this
tract
only
the
portuguese
port
of
inhambane
on
the
south
and
a
portion
of
the
sultan
of
zanzibars
dominion
on
the
north
for
our
cruisers
to
look
after
the
lake
people
grow
abundance
of
cotton
for
their
own
consumption
and
can
sell
it
for
a
penny
a
pound
or
even
less
watercarriage
exists
by
the
shire
and
zambesi
all
the
way
to
england
with
the
single
exception
of
a
portage
of
about
thirtyfive
miles
past
the
murchison
cataracts
along
which
a
road
of
less
than
forty
miles
could
be
made
at
a
trifling
expense
and
it
seems
feasible
that
a
legitimate
and
thriving
trade
might
in
a
short
time
take
the
place
of
the
present
unlawful
traffic
colonel
rigby
captains
wilson
oldfield
and
chapman
and
all
the
most
intelligent
officers
on
the
coast
were
unanimous
in
the
belief
that
one
small
vessel
on
the
lake
would
have
decidedly
more
influence
and
do
more
good
in
suppressing
the
slavetrade
than
half
a
dozen
menofwar
on
the
ocean
by
judicious
operations
therefore
on
a
small
scale
inland
little
expense
would
be
incurred
and
the
english
slavetrade
policy
on
the
east
would
have
the
same
fair
chance
of
success
as
on
the
west
coast
after
a
landjourney
of
forty
days
we
returned
to
the
ship
on
the
th
of
october
in
a
somewhat
exhausted
condition
arising
more
from
a
sort
of
poisoning
than
from
the
usual
fatigue
of
travel
we
had
taken
a
little
mulligatawney
paste
for
making
soup
in
case
of
want
of
time
to
cook
other
food
late
one
afternoon
at
the
end
of
an
unusually
long
march
we
reached
mikena
near
the
base
of
mount
njongone
to
the
north
of
zomba
and
the
cook
was
directed
to
use
a
couple
of
spoonfuls
of
the
paste
but
instead
of
doing
so
he
put
in
the
whole
potful
the
soup
tasted
rather
hot
but
we
added
boiled
rice
to
it
and
being
very
hungry
partook
freely
of
it
and
in
consequence
of
the
overdose
we
were
delayed
several
days
in
severe
suffering
and
some
of
the
party
did
not
recover
till
after
our
return
to
the
ship
our
illness
may
partly
have
arisen
from
another
cause
one
kind
of
cassava
jatropha
maligna
is
known
to
be
in
its
raw
state
poisonous
but
by
boiling
it
carefully
in
two
waters
which
must
be
thrown
off
the
poison
is
extracted
and
the
cassava
rendered
fit
for
food
the
poisonous
sort
is
easily
known
by
raising
a
bit
of
the
bark
of
the
root
and
putting
the
tongue
to
it
a
bitter
taste
shows
poison
but
it
is
probable
that
even
the
sweet
kind
contains
an
injurious
principle
the
sap
which
like
that
of
our
potatoes
is
injurious
as
an
article
of
food
is
used
in
the
pepperpot
of
the
west
indies
under
the
name
of
cassereep
as
a
perfect
preservative
of
meat
this
juice
put
into
an
earthen
vessel
with
a
little
water
and
chili
pepper
is
said
to
keep
meat
that
is
immersed
in
it
good
for
a
great
length
of
time
even
for
years
no
iron
or
steel
must
touch
the
mixture
or
it
will
become
sour
this
pepperpot
of
which
we
first
heard
from
the
late
archbishop
whately
is
a
most
economical
meatsafe
in
a
hot
climate
any
beef
mutton
pork
or
fowl
that
may
be
left
at
dinner
if
put
into
the
mixture
and
a
little
fresh
cassereep
added
keeps
perfectly
though
otherwise
the
heat
of
the
climate
or
flies
would
spoil
it
our
cook
however
boiled
the
cassava
root
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
cooking
meat
namely
by
filling
the
pot
with
it
and
then
pouring
in
water
which
he
allowed
to
stand
on
the
fire
until
it
had
become
absorbed
and
boiled
away
this
method
did
not
expel
the
poisonous
properties
of
the
root
or
render
it
wholesome
for
notwithstanding
our
systematic
caution
in
purchasing
only
the
harmless
sort
we
suffered
daily
from
its
effects
and
it
was
only
just
before
the
end
of
our
trip
that
this
pernicious
mode
of
boiling
it
was
discovered
by
us
in
ascending
feet
from
the
lowlands
to
the
highlands
or
on
reaching
the
low
valley
of
the
shire
from
the
higher
grounds
the
change
of
climate
was
very
marked
the
heat
was
oppressive
below
the
thermometer
standing
at
from
degrees
to
degrees
in
the
shade
and
our
spirits
were
as
dull
and
languid
as
they
had
been
exhilarated
on
the
heights
in
a
temperature
cooler
by
some
degrees
the
water
of
the
river
was
sometimes
degrees
or
higher
whilst
that
we
had
been
drinking
in
the
hill
streams
was
only
degrees
it
was
found
necessary
to
send
two
of
our
number
across
from
the
shire
to
tette
and
dr
kirk
with
guides
from
chibisa
and
accompanied
by
mr
rae
the
engineer
accomplished
the
journey
we
had
found
the
country
to
the
north
and
east
so
very
well
watered
that
no
difficulty
was
anticipated
in
this
respect
in
a
march
of
less
than
a
hundred
miles
but
on
this
occasion
our
friends
suffered
severely
the
little
water
to
be
had
at
this
time
of
the
year
by
digging
in
the
beds
of
dry
watercourses
was
so
brackish
as
to
increase
thirstsome
of
the
natives
indeed
were
making
salt
from
it
and
when
at
long
intervals
a
less
brackish
supply
was
found
it
was
nauseous
and
muddy
from
the
frequent
visits
of
large
game
the
tsetse
abounded
the
country
was
level
and
large
tracts
of
it
covered
with
mopane
forest
the
leaves
of
which
afford
but
scanty
shade
to
the
baked
earth
so
that
scarcely
any
grass
grows
upon
it
the
sun
was
so
hot
that
the
men
frequently
jumped
from
the
path
in
the
vain
hope
of
cooling
for
a
moment
their
scorched
feet
under
the
almost
shadeless
bushes
and
the
native
who
carried
the
provision
of
salt
pork
got
lost
and
came
into
tette
two
days
after
the
rest
of
the
party
with
nothing
but
the
fibre
of
the
meat
left
the
fat
melted
by
the
blazing
sun
having
all
run
down
his
back
this
path
was
soon
made
a
highway
for
slaving
parties
by
captain
raposo
the
commandant
the
journey
nearly
killed
our
two
active
young
friends
and
what
the
slaves
must
have
since
suffered
on
it
no
one
can
conceive
but
slaving
probably
can
never
be
conducted
without
enormous
suffering
and
loss
of
life
mankokwe
now
sent
a
message
to
say
that
he
wished
us
to
stop
at
his
village
on
our
way
down
he
came
on
board
on
our
arrival
there
with
a
handsome
present
and
said
that
his
young
people
had
dissuaded
him
from
visiting
us
before
but
now
he
was
determined
to
see
what
every
one
else
was
seeing
a
bald
squareheaded
man
who
had
been
his
prime
minister
when
we
came
up
was
now
out
of
office
and
another
old
man
who
had
taken
his
place
accompanied
the
chief
in
passing
the
elephant
marsh
we
saw
nine
large
herds
of
elephants
they
sometimes
formed
a
line
two
miles
long
on
the
nd
of
november
we
anchored
off
shamoara
and
sent
the
boat
to
senna
for
biscuit
and
other
provisions
senhor
ferrao
with
his
wonted
generosity
gave
us
a
present
of
a
bullock
which
he
sent
to
us
in
a
canoe
wishing
to
know
if
a
second
bullock
would
be
acceptable
to
us
he
consulted
his
portuguese
and
english
dictionary
and
asked
the
sailor
in
charge
if
he
would
take
another
but
jack

replied
oh
no
sir
thank
you
i
dont
want
an
otter
in
the
boat
they
are
such
terrible
biters
we
had
to
ground
the
vessel
on
a
shallow
sandbank
every
night
she
leaked
so
fast
that
in
deep
water
she
would
have
sunk
and
the
pump
had
to
be
worked
all
day
to
keep
her
afloat
heavy
rains
fell
daily
producing
the
usual
injurious
effects
in
the
cabin
and
unable
to
wait
any
longer
for
our
associates
who
had
gone
overland
from
the
shire
to
tette
we
ran
down
the
kongone
and
beached
her
for
repairs
her
majestys
ship
lynx
lieut
berkeley
commanding
called
shortly
afterwards
with
supplies
the
bar
which
had
been
perfectly
smooth
for
some
time
before
became
rather
rough
just
before
her
arrival
so
that
it
was
two
or
three
days
before
she
could
communicate
with
us
two
of
her
boats
tried
to
come
in
on
the
second
day
and
one
of
them
mistaking
the
passage
capsized
in
the
heavy
breakers
abreast
of
the
island
mr
hunt
gunner
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
second
boat
behaved
nobly
and
by
his
skilful
and
gallant
conduct
succeeded
in
rescuing
every
one
of
the
first
boats
crew
of
course
the
things
that
they
were
bringing
to
us
were
lost
but
we
were
thankful
that
all
the
men
were
saved
the
loss
of
the
mailbags
containing
government
despatches
and
our
friends
letters
for
the
past
year
was
felt
severely
as
we
were
on
the
point
of
starting
on
an
expedition
into
the
interior
which
might
require
eight
or
nine
months
and
twenty
months
is
a
weary
time
to
be
without
news
of
friends
and
family
in
the
repairing
of
our
crazy
craft
we
received
kind
and
efficient
aid
from
lieutenant
berkeley
and
we
were
enabled
to
leave
for
tette
on
december
th
we
had
now
frequent
rains
and
the
river
rose
considerably
our
progress
up
the
stream
was
distressingly
slow
and
it
was
not
until
the
nd
of
february
that
we
reached
tette
mr
thornton
returned
on
the
same
day
from
a
geological
tour
by
which
some
portuguese
expected
that
a
fabulous
silvermine
would
be
rediscovered
the
tradition
in
the
country
is
that
the
jesuits
formerly
knew
and
worked
a
precious
lode
at
chicova
mr
thornton
had
gone
beyond
zumbo
in
company
with
a
trader
of
colour
he
soon
after
this
left
the
zambesi
and
joining
the
expedition
of
the
baron
van
der
decken
explored
the
snow
mountain
kilimanjaro
northwest
of
zanzibar
mr
thorntons
companion
the
trader
brought
back
much
ivory
having
found
it
both
abundant
and
cheap
he
was
obliged
however
to
pay
heavy
fines
to
the
banyai
and
other
tribes
in
the
country
which
is
coolly
claimed
in
europe
as
portuguese
during
this
trip
of
six
mouths
pieces
of
cotton
cloth
of
sixteen
yards
each
besides
beads
and
brass
wire
were
paid
to
the
different
chiefs
for
leave
to
pass
through
their
country
in
addition
to
these
sufficiently
weighty
exactions
the
natives
of
this
dominion
have
got
into
the
habit
of
imposing
fines
for
alleged
milandos
or
crimes
which
the
traders
men
may
have
unwittingly
committed
the
merchants
however
submit
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
fighting
the
general
monotony
of
existence
at
tette
is
sometimes
relieved
by
an
occasional
death
or
wedding
when
the
deceased
is
a
person
of
consequence
the
quantity
of
gunpowder
his
slaves
are
allowed
to
expend
is
enormous
the
expense
may
in
proportion
to
their
means
resemble
that
incurred
by
foolishly
gaudy
funerals
in
england
when
at
tette
we
always
joined
with
sympathizing
hearts
in
aiding
by
our
presence
at
the
last
rites
to
soothe
the
sorrows
of
the
surviving
relatives
we
are
sure
that
they
would
have
done
the
same
to
us
had
we
been
the
mourners
we
never
had
to
complain
of
want
of
hospitality
indeed
the
great
kindness
shown
by
many
of
whom
we
have
often
spoken
will
never
be
effaced
from
our
memory
till
our
dying
day
when
we
speak
of
their
failings
it
is
in
sorrow
not
in
anger
their
trading
in
slaves
is
an
enormous
mistake
their
government
places
them
in
a
false
position
by
cutting
them
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
of
this
they
always
speak
with
a
bitterness
which
were
it
heard
might
alter
the
tone
of
the
statesmen
of
lisbon
but
here
there
is
no
press
no
booksellers
shops
and
scarcely
a
schoolmaster
had
we
been
born
in
similar
untoward
circumstanceswe
tremble
to
think
of
it
the
weddings
are
celebrated
with
as
much
jollity
as
weddings
are
anywhere
we
witnessed
one
in
the
house
of
our
friend
the
padre
it
being
the
marriage
of
his
goddaughter
he
kindly
invited
us
to
be
partakers
in
his
joy
and
we
there
became
acquainted
with
old
donna
engenia
who
was
a
married
wife
and
had
children
when
the
slaves
came
from
cassange
before
any
of
us
were
born
the
whole
merrymaking
was
marked
by
good
taste
amid
propriety
about
the
only
interesting
object
in
the
vicinity
of
tette
is
the
coal
a
few
miles
to
the
north
there
in
the
feeders
of
the
stream
revubue
it
crops
out
in
cliff
sections
the
seams
are
from
four
to
seven
feet
in
thickness
one
measured
was
found
to
be
twentyfive
feet
thick
learning
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
our
party
to
obtain
food
beyond
kebrabasa
before
the
new
crop
came
in
and
knowing
the
difficulty
of
hunting
for
so
many
men
in
the
wet
season
we
decided
on
deferring
our
departure
for
the
interior
until
may
and
in
the
mean
time
to
run
down
once
more
to
the
kongone
in
the
hopes
of
receiving
letters
and
despatches
from
the
manofwar
that
was
to
call
in
march
we
left
tette
on
the
th
and
at
senna
heard
that
our
lost
mail
had
been
picked
up
on
the
beach
by
natives
west
of
the
milambe
carried
to
quillimane
sent
thence
to
senna
and
passing
us
somewhere
on
the
river
on
to
tette
at
shupanga
the
governor
informed
us
that
it
was
a
very
large
mail
no
great
comfort
seeing
it
was
away
up
the
river
mosquitoes
were
excessively
troublesome
at
the
harbour
and
especially
when
a
light
breeze
blew
from
the
north
over
the
mangroves
we
lived
for
several
weeks
in
small
huts
built
by
our
men
those
who
did
the
hunting
for
the
party
always
got
wet
and
were
attacked
by
fever
but
generally
recovered
in
time
to
be
out
again
before
the
meat
was
all
consumed
no
ship
appearing
we
started
off
on
the
th
of
march
and
stopped
to
wood
on
the
luabo
near
an
encampment
of
hippopotamus
hunters
our
men
heard
again
through
them
of
the
canoe
path
from
this
place
to
quillimane
but
they
declined
to
point
it
out
we
found
our
friend
major
sicard
at
mazaro
with
picks
shovels
hurdles
and
slaves
having
come
to
build
a
fort
and
customhouse
at
the
kongone
as
we
had
no
good
reason
to
hide
the
harbour
but
many
for
its
being
made
known
we
supplied
him
with
a
chart
of
the
tortuous
branches
which
running
among
the
mangroves
perplex
the
search
and
with
such
directions
as
would
enable
him
to
find
his
way
down
to
the
river
he
had
brought
the
relics
of
our
fugitive
mail
and
it
was
a
disappointment
to
find
that
all
had
been
lost
with
the
exception
of
a
bundle
of
old
newspapers
two
photographs
and
three
letters
which
had
been
written
before
we
left
england
the
distance
from
mazaro
on
the
zambesi
side
to
the
kwakwa
at
nterra
is
about
six
miles
over
a
surprisingly
rich
dark
soil
we
passed
the
night
in
the
long
shed
erected
at
nterra
on
the
banks
of
this
river
for
the
use
of
travellers
who
have
often
to
wait
several
days
for
canoes
we
tried
to
sleep
but
the
mosquitoes
and
rats
were
so
troublesome
as
to
render
sleep
impossible
the
rats
or
rather
large
mice
closely
resembling
mus
pumilio
smith
of
this
region
are
quite
facetious
and
having
a
great
deal
of
fun
in
them
often
laugh
heartily
again
and
again
they
woke
us
up
by
scampering
over
our
faces
and
then
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
of
he
he
he
at
having
performed
the
feat
their
sense
of
the
ludicrous
appears
to
be
exquisite
they
screamed
with
laughter
at
the
attempts
which
disturbed
and
angry
human
nature
made
in
the
dark
to
bring
their
illtimed
merriment
to
a
close
unlike
their
prudent
european
cousins
which
are
said
to
leave
a
sinking
ship
a
party
of
these
took
up
their
quarters
in
our
leaky
and
sinking
vessel
quiet
and
invisible
by
day
they
emerged
at
night
and
cut
their
funny
pranks
no
sooner
were
we
all
asleep
than
they
made
a
sudden
dash
over
the
lockers
and
across
our
faces
for
the
cabin
door
where
all
broke
out
into
a
loud
he
he
he
he
he
he
showing
how
keenly
they
enjoyed
the
joke
they
next
went
forward
with
as
much
delight
and
scampered
over
the
men
every
night
they
went
fore
and
aft
rousing
with
impartial
feet
every
sleeper
and
laughing
to
scorn
the
aimless
blows
growls
and
deadly
rushes
of
outraged
humanity
we
observed
elsewhere
a
species
of
large
mouse
nearly
allied
to
euryotis
unisulcatus
f
cuvier
escaping
up
a
rough
and
not
very
upright
wall
with
six
young
ones
firmly
attached
to
the
perineum
they
were
old
enough
to
be
well
covered
with
hair
and
some
were
not
detached
by
a
blow
which
disabled
the
dam
we
could
not
decide
whether
any
involuntary
muscles
were
brought
into
play
in
helping
the
young
to
adhere
their
weight
seemed
to
require
a
sort
of
cataleptic
state
of
the
muscles
of
the
jaw
to
enable
them
to
hold
on
scorpions
centipedes
and
poisonous
spiders
also
were
not
unfrequently
brought
into
the
ship
with
the
wood
and
occasionally
found
their
way
into
our
beds
but
in
every
instance
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
discover
and
destroy
them
before
they
did
any
harm
naval
officers
on
this
coast
report
that
when
scorpions
and
centipedes
remain
a
few
weeks
after
being
taken
on
board
in
a
similar
manner
their
poison
loses
nearly
all
its
virulence
but
this
we
did
not
verify
snakes
sometimes
came
in
with
the
wood
but
oftener
floated
down
the
river
to
us
climbing
on
board
with
ease
by
the
chaincable
and
some
poisonous
ones
were
caught
in
the
cabin
a
green
snake
lived
with
us
several
weeks
concealing
himself
behind
the
casing
of
the
deckhouse
in
the
daytime
to
be
aroused
in
the
dark
by
five
feet
of
cold
green
snake
gliding
over
ones
face
is
rather
unpleasant
however
rapid
the
movement
may
be
myriads
of
two
varieties
of
cockroaches
infested
the
vessel
they
not
only
ate
round
the
roots
of
our
nails
but
even
devoured
and
defiled
our
food
flannels
and
boots
vain
were
all
our
efforts
to
extirpate
these
destructive
pests
if
you
kill
one
say
the
sailors
a
hundred
come
down
to
his
funeral
in
the
work
of
commodore
owen
it
is
stated
that
cockroaches
pounded
into
a
paste
form
a
powerful
carminative
this
has
not
been
confirmed
but
when
monkeys
are
fed
on
them
they
are
sure
to
become
lean
on
coming
to
senna
we
found
that
the
zulus
had
arrived
in
force
for
their
annual
tribute
these
men
are
under
good
discipline
and
never
steal
from
the
people
the
tax
is
claimed
on
the
ground
of
conquest
the
zulus
having
formerly
completely
overcome
the
senna
people
and
chased
them
on
to
the
islands
in
the
zambesi
fiftyfour
of
the
portuguese
were
slain
on
the
occasion
and
notwithstanding
the
mud
fort
the
village
has
never
recovered
its
former
power
fever
was
now
very
prevalent
and
most
of
the
portuguese
were
down
with
it
for
a
good
view
of
the
adjacent
scenery
the
hill
baramuana
behind
the
village
was
ascended
a
caution
was
given
about
the
probability
of
an
attack
of
fever
from
a
plant
that
grows
near
the
summit
dr
kirk
discovered
it
to
be
the
paedevia
foetida
which
when
smelt
actually
does
give
headache
and
fever
it
has
a
nasty
fetor
as
its
name
indicates
this
is
one
instance
in
which
fever
and
a
foul
smell
coincide
in
a
number
of
instances
offensive
effluvia
and
fever
seems
to
have
no
connection
owing
to
the
abundant
rains
the
crops
in
the
senna
district
were
plentiful
this
was
fortunate
after
the
partial
failure
of
the
past
two
years
it
was
the
th
of
april
before
we
reached
tette
here
also
the
crops
were
luxuriant
and
the
people
said
that
they
had
not
had
such
abundance
since
the
year
when
dr
livingstone
came
down
the
river
it
is
astonishing
to
any
one
who
has
seen
the
works
for
irrigation
in
other
countries
as
at
the
cape
and
in
egypt
that
no
attempt
has
ever
been
made
to
lead
out
the
water
either
of
the
zambesi
or
any
of
its
tributaries
no
machinery
has
ever
been
used
to
raise
it
even
from
the
stream
but
droughts
and
starvations
are
endured
as
if
they
were
inevitable
dispensations
of
providence
incapable
of
being
mitigated
feeling
in
honour
bound
to
return
with
those
who
had
been
the
faithful
companions
of
dr
livingstone
in
and
to
whose
guardianship
and
services
was
due
the
accomplishment
of
a
journey
which
all
the
portuguese
at
tette
had
previously
pronounced
impossible
the
requisite
steps
were
taken
to
convey
them
to
their
homes
we
laid
the
ship
alongside
of
the
island
kanyimbe
opposite
tette
and
before
starting
for
the
country
of
the
makololo
obtained
a
small
plot
of
land
to
form
a
garden
for
the
two
english
sailors
who
were
to
remain
in
charge
during
our
absence
we
furnished
them
with
a
supply
of
seeds
and
they
set
to
work
with
such
zeal
that
they
certainly
merited
success
their
first
attempt
at
african
horticulture
met
with
failure
from
a
most
unexpected
source
every
seed
was
dug
up
and
the
inside
of
it
eaten
by
mice
yes
said
an
old
native
next
morning
on
seeing
the
husks
that
is
what
happens
this
month
for
it
is
the
mouse
month
and
the
seed
should
have
been
sown
last
mouth
when
i
sowed
mine
the
sailors
however
sowed
more
next
day
and
being
determined
to
outwit
the
mice
they
this
time
covered
the
beds
over
with
grass
the
onions
with
other
seeds
of
plants
cultivated
by
the
portuguese
are
usually
planted
in
the
beginning
of
april
in
order
to
have
the
advantage
of
the
cold
season
the
wheat
a
little
later
for
the
same
reason
if
sown
at
the
beginning
of
the
rainy
season
in
november
it
runs
as
before
remarked
entirely
to
straw
but
as
the
rains
are
nearly
over
in
may
advantage
is
taken
of
low
lying
patches
which
have
been
flooded
by
the
river
a
hole
is
made
in
the
mud
with
a
hoe
a
few
seeds
dropped
in
and
the
earth
shoved
back
with
the
foot
if
not
favoured
with
certain
misty
showers
which
lower
down
the
river
are
simply
fogs
water
is
borne
from
the
river
to
the
roots
of
the
wheat
in
earthern
pots
and
in
about
four
months
the
crop
is
ready
for
the
sickle
the
wheat
of
tette
is
exported
as
the
best
grown
in
the
country
but
a
hollow
spot
at
maruru
close
by
mazaro
yielded
very
good
crops
though
just
at
the
level
of
the
sea
as
a
few
inches
rise
of
tide
shows
a
number
of
days
were
spent
in
busy
preparation
for
our
journey
the
cloth
beads
and
brass
wire
for
the
trip
were
sewn
up
in
old
canvas
and
each
package
had
the
bearers
name
printed
on
it
the
makololo
who
had
worked
for
the
expedition
were
paid
for
their
services
and
every
one
who
had
come
down
with
the
doctor
from
the
interior
received
a
present
of
cloth
and
ornaments
in
order
to
protect
them
from
the
greater
cold
of
their
own
country
and
to
show
that
they
had
not
come
in
vain
though
called
makololo
by
courtesy
as
they
were
proud
of
the
name
kanyata
the
principal
headman
was
the
only
real
makololo
of
the
party
and
he
in
virtue
of
his
birth
had
succeeded
to
the
chief
place
on
the
death
of
sekwebu
the
others
belonged
to
the
conquered
tribes
of
the
batoka
bashubia
baselea
and
barotse
some
of
these
men
had
only
added
to
their
own
vices
those
of
the
tette
slaves
others
by
toiling
during
the
first
two
years
in
navigating
canoes
and
hunting
elephants
had
often
managed
to
save
a
little
to
take
back
to
their
own
country
but
had
to
part
with
it
all
for
food
to
support
the
rest
in
times
of
hunger
and
latterly
had
fallen
into
the
improvident
habits
of
slaves
and
spent
their
surplus
earnings
in
beer
and
agua
ardiente
everything
being
ready
on
the
th
of
may
we
started
at
pm
from
the
village
where
the
makololo
had
dwelt
a
number
of
the
men
did
not
leave
with
the
goodwill
which
their
talk
for
months
before
had
led
us
to
anticipate
but
some
proceeded
upon
being
told
that
they
were
not
compelled
to
go
unless
they
liked
though
others
altogether
declined
moving
many
had
taken
up
with
slavewomen
whom
they
assisted
in
hoeing
and
in
consuming
the
produce
of
their
gardens
some
fourteen
children
had
been
born
to
them
and
in
consequence
of
now
having
no
chief
to
order
them
or
to
claim
their
services
they
thought
that
they
were
about
as
well
off
as
they
had
been
in
their
own
country
they
knew
and
regretted
that
they
could
call
neither
wives
nor
children
their
own
the
slaveowners
claimed
the
whole
but
their
natural
affections
had
been
so
enchained
that
they
clave
to
the
domestic
ties
by
a
law
of
portugal
the
baptized
children
of
slave
women
are
all
free
by
the
custom
of
the
zambesi
that
law
is
void
when
it
is
referred
to
the
officers
laugh
and
say
these
lisbonborn
laws
are
very
stringent
but
somehow
possibly
from
the
heat
of
the
climate
here
they
lose
all
their
force
only
one
woman
joined
our
partythe
wife
of
a
batoka
man
she
had
been
given
to
him
in
consideration
of
his
skilful
dancing
by
the
chief
chisaka
a
merchant
sent
three
of
his
men
along
with
us
with
a
present
for
sekeletu
and
major
sicard
also
lent
us
three
more
to
assist
us
on
our
return
and
two
portuguese
gentleman
kindly
gave
us
the
loan
of
a
couple
of
donkeys
we
slept
four
miles
above
tette
and
hearing
that
the
banyai
who
levy
heavy
fines
on
the
portuguese
traders
lived
chiefly
on
the
right
bank
we
crossed
over
to
the
left
as
we
could
not
fully
trust
our
men
if
the
banyai
had
come
in
a
threatening
manner
our
followers
might
perhaps
from
having
homes
behind
them
have
even
put
down
their
bundles
and
run
indeed
two
of
them
at
this
point
made
up
their
minds
to
go
no
further
and
turned
back
to
tette
another
monga
a
batoka
was
much
perplexed
and
could
not
make
out
what
course
to
pursue
as
he
had
three
years
previously
wounded
kanyata
the
headman
with
a
spear
this
is
a
capital
offence
among
the
makololo
and
he
was
afraid
of
being
put
to
death
for
it
on
his
return
he
tried
in
vain
to
console
himself
with
the
facts
that
he
had
neither
father
mother
sisters
nor
brothers
to
mourn
for
him
and
that
he
could
die
but
once
he
was
good
and
would
go
up
to
the
stars
to
yesu
and
therefore
did
not
care
for
death
in
spite
however
of
these
reflections
he
was
much
cast
down
until
kanyata
assured
him
that
he
would
never
mention
his
misdeed
to
the
chief
indeed
he
had
never
even
mentioned
it
to
the
doctor
which
he
would
assuredly
have
done
had
it
lain
heavy
on
his
heart
we
were
right
glad
of
mongas
company
for
he
was
a
merry
goodtempered
fellow
and
his
lithe
manly
figure
had
always
been
in
the
front
in
danger
and
from
being
lefthanded
had
been
easily
recognized
in
the
fight
with
elephants
we
commenced
for
a
certain
number
of
days
with
short
marches
walking
gently
until
broken
in
to
travel
this
is
of
so
much
importance
that
it
occurs
to
us
that
more
might
be
made
out
of
soldiers
if
the
first
few
days
marches
were
easy
and
gradually
increased
in
length
and
quickness
the
nights
were
cold
with
heavy
dews
and
occasional
showers
and
we
had
several
cases
of
fever
some
of
the
men
deserted
every
night
and
we
fully
expected
that
all
who
had
children
would
prefer
to
return
to
tette
for
little
ones
are
well
known
to
prove
the
strongest
ties
even
to
slaves
it
was
useless
informing
them
that
if
they
wanted
to
return
they
had
only
to
come
and
tell
us
so
we
should
not
be
angry
with
them
for
preferring
tette
to
their
own
country
contact
with
slaves
had
destroyed
their
sense
of
honour
they
would
not
go
in
daylight
but
decamped
in
the
night
only
in
one
instance
however
taking
our
goods
though
in
two
more
they
carried
off
their
comrades
property
by
the
time
we
had
got
well
into
the
kebrabasa
hills
thirty
men
nearly
a
third
of
the
party
had
turned
back
and
it
became
evident
that
if
many
more
left
us
sekeletus
goods
could
not
be
carried
up
at
last
when
the
refuse
had
fallen
away
no
more
desertions
took
place
stopping
one
afternoon
at
a
kebrabasa
village
a
man
who
pretended
to
be
able
to
change
himself
into
a
lion
came
to
salute
us
smelling
the
gunpowder
from
a
gun
which
had
been
discharged
he
went
on
one
side
to
get
out
of
the
wind
of
the
piece
trembling
in
a
most
artistic
manner
but
quite
overacting
his
part
the
makololo
explained
to
us
that
he
was
a
pondoro
or
a
man
who
can
change
his
form
at
will
and
added
that
he
trembles
when
he
smells
gunpowder
do
you
not
see
how
he
is
trembling
now
we
told
them
to
ask
him
to
change
himself
at
once
into
a
lion
and
we
would
give
him
a
cloth
for
the
performance
oh
no
replied
they
if
we
tell
him
so
he
may
change
himself
and
come
when
we
are
asleep
and
kill
us
having
similar
superstitions
at
home
they
readily
became
as
firm
believers
in
the
pondoro
as
the
natives
of
the
village
we
were
told
that
he
assumes
the
form
of
a
lion
and
remains
in
the
woods
for
days
and
is
sometimes
absent
for
a
whole
month
his
considerate
wife
had
built
him
a
hut
or
den
in
which
she
places
food
and
beer
for
her
transformed
lord
whose
metamorphosis
does
not
impair
his
human
appetite
no
one
ever
enters
this
hut
except
the
pondoro
and
his
wife
and
no
stranger
is
allowed
even
to
rest
his
gun
against
the
baobabtree
beside
it
the
mfumo
or
petty
chief
of
another
small
village
wished
to
fine
our
men
for
placing
their
muskets
against
an
old
tumbledown
hut
it
being
that
of
the
pondoro
at
times
the
pondoro
employs
his
acquired
powers
in
hunting
for
the
benefit
of
the
village
and
after
an
absence
of
a
day
or
two
his
wife
smells
the
lion
takes
a
certain
medicine
places
it
in
the
forest
and
there
quickly
leaves
it
lest
the
lion
should
kill
even
her
this
medicine
enables
the
pondoro
to
change
himself
back
into
a
man
return
to
the
village
and
say
go
and
get
the
game
that
i
have
killed
for
you
advantage
is
of
course
taken
of
what
a
lion
has
done
and
they
go
and
bring
home
the
buffalo
or
antelope
killed
when
he
was
a
lion
or
rather
found
when
he
was
patiently
pursuing
his
course
of
deception
in
the
forest
we
saw
the
pondoro
of
another
village
dressed
in
a
fantastic
style
with
numerous
charms
hung
round
him
and
followed
by
a
troop
of
boys
who
were
honouring
him
with
rounds
of
shrill
cheering
it
is
believed
also
that
the
souls
of
departed
chiefs
enter
into
lions
and
render
them
sacred
on
one
occasion
when
we
had
shot
a
buffalo
in
the
path
beyond
the
kafue
a
hungry
lion
attracted
probably
by
the
smell
of
the
meat
came
close
to
our
camp
and
roused
up
all
hands
by
his
roaring
tuba
mokoro
imbued
with
the
popular
belief
that
the
beast
was
a
chief
in
disguise
scolded
him
roundly
during
his
brief
intervals
of
silence
you
a
chief
eh
you
call
yourself
a
chief
do
you
what
kind
of
chief
are
you
to
come
sneaking
about
in
the
dark
trying
to
steal
our
buffalo
meat
are
you
not
ashamed
of
yourself
a
pretty
chief
truly
you
are
like
the
scavenger
beetle
and
think
of
yourself
only
you
have
not
the
heart
of
a
chief
why
dont
you
kill
your
own
beef
you
must
have
a
stone
in
your
chest
and
no
heart
at
all
indeed
tuba
mokoro
producing
no
impression
on
the
transformed
chief
one
of
the
men
the
most
sedate
of
the
party
who
seldom
spoke
took
up
the
matter
and
tried
the
lion
in
another
strain
in
his
slow
quiet
way
he
expostulated
with
him
on
the
impropriety
of
such
conduct
to
strangers
who
had
never
injured
him
we
were
travelling
peaceably
through
the
country
back
to
our
own
chief
we
never
killed
people
nor
stole
anything
the
buffalo
meat
was
ours
not
his
and
it
did
not
become
a
great
chief
like
him
to
be
prowling
round
in
the
dark
trying
like
a
hyena
to
steal
the
meat
of
strangers
he
might
go
and
hunt
for
himself
as
there
was
plenty
of
game
in
the
forest
the
pondoro
being
deaf
to
reason
and
only
roaring
the
louder
the
men
became
angry
and
threatened
to
send
a
ball
through
him
if
he
did
not
go
away
they
snatched
up
their
guns
to
shoot
him
but
he
prudently
kept
in
the
dark
outside
the
luminous
circle
made
by
our
camp
fires
and
there
they
did
not
like
to
venture
a
little
strychnine
was
put
into
a
piece
of
meat
and
thrown
to
him
when
he
soon
departed
and
we
heard
no
more
of
the
majestic
sneaker
the
kebrabasa
people
were
now
plumper
and
in
better
condition
than
on
our
former
visits
the
harvest
had
been
abundant
they
had
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
and
they
were
enjoying
life
as
much
as
ever
they
could
at
defwes
village
near
where
the
ship
lay
on
her
first
ascent
we
found
two
mfumos
or
headmen
the
son
and
soninlaw
of
the
former
chief
a
sisters
son
has
much
more
chance
of
succeeding
to
a
chieftainship
than
the
chiefs
own
offspring
it
being
unquestionable
that
the
sisters
child
has
the
family
blood
the
men
are
all
marked
across
the
nose
and
up
the
middle
of
the
forehead
with
short
horizontal
bars
or
cicatrices
and
a
single
brass
earring
of
two
or
three
inches
diameter
like
the
ancient
egyptian
is
worn
by
the
men
some
wear
the
hair
long
like
the
ancient
assyrians
and
egyptians
and
a
few
have
eyes
with
the
downward
and
inward
slant
of
the
chinese
after
fording
the
rapid
luia
we
left
our
former
path
on
the
banks
of
the
zambesi
and
struck
off
in
a
nw
direction
behind
one
of
the
hill
ranges
the
eastern
end
of
which
is
called
mongwa
the
name
of
an
acacia
having
a
peculiarly
strong
fetor
found
on
it
our
route
wound
up
a
valley
along
a
small
mountainstream
which
was
nearly
dry
and
then
crossed
the
rocky
spurs
of
some
of
the
lofty
hills
the
country
was
all
very
dry
at
the
time
and
no
water
was
found
except
in
an
occasional
spring
and
a
few
wells
dug
in
the
beds
of
watercourses
the
people
were
poor
and
always
anxious
to
convince
travellers
of
the
fact
the
men
unlike
those
on
the
plains
spend
a
good
deal
of
their
time
in
hunting
this
may
be
because
they
have
but
little
ground
on
the
hillsides
suitable
for
gardens
and
but
little
certainty
of
reaping
what
may
be
sown
in
the
valleys
no
women
came
forward
in
the
hamlet
east
of
chiperiziwa
where
we
halted
for
the
night
two
shots
had
been
fired
at
guineafowl
a
little
way
off
in
the
valley
the
women
fled
into
the
woods
and
the
men
came
to
know
if
war
was
meant
and
a
few
of
the
old
folks
only
returned
after
hearing
that
we
were
for
peace
the
headman
kambira
apologized
for
not
having
a
present
ready
and
afterwards
brought
us
some
meal
a
roasted
coney
hyrax
capensis
and
a
pot
of
beer
he
wished
to
be
thought
poor
the
beer
had
come
to
him
from
a
distance
he
had
none
of
his
own
like
the
manganja
these
people
salute
by
clapping
their
hands
when
a
man
comes
to
a
place
where
others
are
seated
before
sitting
down
he
claps
his
hands
to
each
in
succession
and
they
do
the
same
to
him
if
he
has
anything
to
tell
both
speaker
and
hearer
clap
their
hands
at
the
close
of
every
paragraph
and
then
again
vigorously
at
the
end
of
the
speech
the
guide
whom
the
headman
gave
us
thus
saluted
each
of
his
comrades
before
he
started
off
with
us
there
is
so
little
difference
in
the
language
that
all
the
tribes
of
this
region
are
virtually
of
one
family
we
proceeded
still
in
the
same
direction
and
passed
only
two
small
hamlets
during
the
day
except
the
noise
our
men
made
on
the
march
everything
was
still
around
us
few
birds
were
seen
the
appearance
of
a
whydahbird
showed
that
he
had
not
yet
parted
with
his
fine
long
plumes
we
passed
immense
quantities
of
ebony
and
lignumvitae
and
the
tree
from
whose
smooth
and
bitter
bark
granaries
are
made
for
corn
the
country
generally
is
clothed
with
a
forest
of
ordinarysized
trees
we
slept
in
the
little
village
near
sindabwe
where
our
men
contrived
to
purchase
plenty
of
beer
and
were
uncommonly
boisterous
all
the
evening
we
breakfasted
next
morning
under
green
wild
datepalms
beside
the
fine
flowery
stream
which
runs
through
the
charming
valley
of
zibah
we
now
had
mount
chiperiziwa
between
us
and
part
of
the
river
near
morumbwa
having
in
fact
come
north
about
in
order
to
avoid
the
difficulties
of
our
former
path
the
last
of
the
deserters
a
reputed
thief
took
french
leave
of
us
here
he
left
the
bundle
of
cloth
he
was
carrying
in
the
path
a
hundred
yards
in
front
of
where
we
halted
but
made
off
with
the
musket
and
most
of
the
brass
rings
and
beads
of
his
comrade
shirimba
who
had
unsuspectingly
intrusted
them
to
his
care
proceeding
sw
up
this
lovely
valley
in
about
an
hours
time
we
reached
sandias
village
the
chief
was
said
to
be
absent
hunting
and
they
did
not
know
when
he
would
return
this
is
such
a
common
answer
to
the
inquiry
after
a
headman
that
one
is
inclined
to
think
that
it
only
means
that
they
wish
to
know
the
strangers
object
before
exposing
their
superior
to
danger
as
some
of
our
men
were
ill
a
halt
was
made
here
as
we
were
unable
to
march
next
morning
six
of
our
young
men
anxious
to
try
their
muskets
went
off
to
hunt
elephants
for
several
hours
they
saw
nothing
and
some
of
them
getting
tired
proposed
to
go
to
a
village
and
buy
food
no
said
mantlanyane
we
came
to
hunt
so
let
us
go
on
in
a
short
time
they
fell
in
with
a
herd
of
cow
elephants
and
calves
as
soon
as
the
first
cow
caught
sight
of
the
hunters
on
the
rocks
above
her
she
with
true
motherly
instinct
placed
her
young
one
between
her
forelegs
for
protection
the
men
were
for
scattering
and
firing
into
the
herd
indiscriminately
that
wont

cried
mantlanyane
let
us
all
fire
at
this
one
the
poor
beast
received
a
volley
and
ran
down
into
the
plain
where
another
shot
killed
her
the
young
one
escaped
with
the
herd
the
men
were
wild
with
excitement
and
danced
round
the
fallen
queen
of
the
forest
with
loud
shouts
and
exultant
songs
they
returned
bearing
as
trophies
the
tail
and
part
of
the
trunk
and
marched
into
camp
as
erect
as
soldiers
and
evidently
feeling
that
their
stature
had
increased
considerably
since
the
morning
sandias
wife
was
duly
informed
of
their
success
as
here
a
law
decrees
that
half
the
elephant
belongs
to
the
chief
on
whose
ground
it
has
been
killed
the
portuguese
traders
always
submit
to
this
tax
and
were
it
of
native
origin
it
could
hardly
be
considered
unjust
a
chief
must
have
some
source
of
revenue
and
as
many
chiefs
can
raise
none
except
from
ivory
or
slaves
this
tax
is
more
free
from
objections
than
any
other
that
a
black
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
could
devise
it
seems
however
to
have
originated
with
the
portuguese
themselves
and
then
to
have
spread
among
the
adjacent
tribes
the
governors
look
sharply
after
any
elephant
that
may
be
slain
on
the
crown
lands
and
demand
one
of
the
tusks
from
their
vassals
we
did
not
find
the
law
in
operation
in
any
tribe
beyond
the
range
of
portuguese
traders
or
further
than
the
sphere
of
travel
of
those
arabs
who
imitated
portuguese
customs
in
trade
at
the
kafue
in
the
chiefs
bought
the
meat
we
killed
and
demanded
nothing
as
their
due
and
so
it
was
up
the
shire
during
our
visits
the
slaves
of
the
portuguese
who
are
sent
by
their
masters
to
shoot
elephants
probably
connive
at
the
extension
of
this
law
for
they
strive
to
get
the
good
will
of
the
chiefs
to
whose
country
they
come
by
advising
them
to
make
a
demand
of
half
of
each
elephant
killed
and
for
this
advice
they
are
well
paid
in
beer
when
we
found
that
the
portuguese
argued
in
favour
of
this
law
we
told
the
natives
that
they
might
exact
tusks
from
them
but
that
the
english
being
different
preferred
the
pure
native
custom
it
was
this
which
made
sandia
as
afterwards
mentioned
hesitate
but
we
did
not
care
to
insist
on
exemption
in
our
favour
where
the
prevalence
of
the
custom
might
have
been
held
to
justify
the
exaction
the
cutting
up
of
an
elephant
is
quite
a
unique
spectacle
the
men
stand
remind
the
animal
in
dead
silence
while
the
chief
of
the
travelling
party
declares
that
according
to
ancient
law
the
head
and
right
hind
leg
belong
to
him
who
killed
the
beast
that
is
to
him
who
inflicted
the
first
wound
the
left
leg
to
bins
who
delivered
the
second
or
first
touched
the
animal
after
it
fell
the
meat
around
the
eye
to
the
english
or
chief
of
the
travellers
and
different
parts
to
the
headmen
of
the
different
fires
or
groups
of
which
the
camp
is
composed
not
forgetting
to
enjoin
the
preservation
of
the
fat
and
bowels
for
a
second
distribution
this
oration
finished
the
natives
soon
become
excited
and
scream
wildly
as
they
cut
away
at
the
carcass
with
a
score
of
spears
whose
long
handles
quiver
in
the
air
above
their
heads
their
excitement
becomes
momentarily
more
and
more
intense
and
reaches
the
culminating
point
when
as
denoted
by
a
roar
of
gas
the
huge
mass
is
laid
fairly
open
some
jump
inside
and
roll
about
there
in
their
eagerness
to
seize
the
precious
fat
while
others
run
off
screaming
with
pieces
of
the
bloody
meat
throw
it
on
the
grass
and
run
back
for
more
all
keep
talking
and
shouting
at
the
utmost
pitch
of
their
voices
sometimes
two
or
three
regardless
of
all
laws
seize
the
same
piece
of
meat
and
have
a
brief
fight
of
words
over
it
occasionally
an
agonized
yell
bursts
forth
and
a
native
emerges
out
of
the
moving
mass
of
dead
elephant
and
wriggling
humanity
with
his
hand
badly
cut
by
the
spear
of
his
excited
friend
and
neighbour
this
requires
a
rag
and
some
soothing
words
to
prevent
bad
blood
in
an
incredibly
short
time
tons
of
meat
are
cut
up
and
placed
in
separate
heaps
around
sandia
arrived
soon
after
the
beast
was
divided
he
is
an
elderly
man
and
wears
a
wig
made
of
ife
fibre
sanseviera
dyed
black
and
of
a
fine

appearance
this
plant
is
allied
to
the
aloes
and
its
thick
fleshy
leaves
in
shape
somewhat
like
our
sedges
when
bruised
yield
much
fine
strong
fibre
which
is
made
into
ropes
nets
and
wigs
it
takes
dyes
readily
and
the
fibre
might
form
a
good
article
of
commerce
ife
wigs
as
we
afterwards
saw
are
not
uncommon
in
this
country

perhaps
not
so
common

by

when
on
hunting
excursions
we
had
the
elephants
forefoot
cooked
for
ourselves
in
native
fashion
a
large
hole
was
dug
in
the
ground
in
which
a
fire
was
made
and
when
the
inside
was
thoroughly
heated
the
entire

was
placed
in

and
covered
over
with
the
hot
ashes
and

another
fire
was
made
above

whole
and
kept
burning
all
night
we
had
the
foot
thus
cooked
for
breakfast
next
morning
and
found
it
delicious
it
is
a
whitish
mass
slightly
gelatinous
and
sweet
like

long

prevent
biliousness
is
a
wise
precaution

are
also
good

much
resemble

ox
but
all
the
other
meat
is
tough
and
from
its
peculiar
flavour
only
to
be
eaten
by
a
hungry
man
the
quantities
of
meat
our
men
devour
is
quite
astounding
they
boil
as
much
as
their
pots
will
hold
and
eat
till
it
becomes
physically
impossible
for
them
to
stow
away
any
more
an
uproarious
dance
follows
accompanied
with
stentorian
song
and
as
soon
as
they
have
shaken
their
first
course
down
and
washed
off
the
sweat
and
dust
of
the
after
performance
they
go
to
work
to
roast
more
a
short
snatch
of
sleep
succeeds
and
they
are
up
and
at
it
again
all
night
long
it
is
boil
and
eat
roast
and
devour
with
a
few
brief
interludes

carnivora
these

can
endure

longer
period

can
cook
meat
as
well
as
any

could
desire

the

sandia
gave
us
two
guides
and
on
the
th
of
june
we
left
the
elephant
valley
taking
a
westerly
course
and
after
crossing
a
few
ridges
entered
the
chingerere
or
paguruguru
valley
through
which
in
the
rainy
season
runs
the
streamlet
pajodze
the
mountains
on
our
left
between
us
and
the
zambesi
our
guides
told
us
have
the
same
name
as
the
valley
but
that
at
the
confluence
of
the
pajodze
is
called
morumbwa
we
struck
the
river
at
less
than
half
a
mile
to
the
north
of
the
cataract
morumbwa
on
climbing
up
the
base
of
this
mountain
at
pajodze
we
found
that
we
were
distant
only
the
diameter
of
the
mountain
from
the
cataract
in
measuring
the
cataract
we
formerly
stood
on
its
southern
flank
now
we
were
perched
on
its
northern
flank
and
at
once
recognized
the
onionshaped
mountain
here
called
zakavuma
whose
smooth
convex
surface
overlooks
the
broken
water
its
bearing
by
compass
was
l
degrees
from
the
spot
to
which
we
had
climbed
and
or
yards
distant
we
now
from
this
standingpoint
therefore
completed
our
inspection
of
all
kebrabasa
and
saw
what
as
a
whole
was
never
before
seen
by
europeans
so
far
as
any
records
show
the
remainder
of
the
kebrabasa
path
on
to
chicova
was
close
to
the
compressed
and
rocky

ranges
of
lofty
treecovered
mountains
with
deep
narrow
valleys
in
which
are
dry
watercourses
or

rivulets
stretch
from
the
northwest
and
are
prolonged
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
in
a
southeasterly
direction
looking
back
the
mountain
scenery
in
kebrabasa
was
magnificent
conspicuous
from
their
form
and
steep
sides
are
the
two
gigantic
portals
of
the
cataract
the
vast
forests
still
wore
their
many
brilliant
autumnalcoloured
tints
of
green
yellow
red
purple
and
brown
thrown
into
relief
by
the
grey
bark
of
the
trunks
in
the
background
among
these
variegated
trees
were
some
conspicuous
for
their
new
livery
of
fresh
lightgreen
leaves
as
though
the
winter
of
others
was
their
spring
the
bright
sunshine
in
these
mountain
forests
and
the
everchanging
forms
of
the
cloud
shadows
gliding
over
portions
of
the
surface
added
fresh
charms
to
scenes
already
surpassingly
beautiful
from
what
we
have
seen
of
the
kebrabasa
rocks
and
rapids
it
appears
too
evident
that
they
must
always
form
a
barrier
to
navigation
at
the
ordinary
low
water
of
the
river
but
the
rise
of
the
water
in
this
gorge
being
as
much
as
eighty
feet
perpendicularly
it
is
probable
that
a
steamer
might
be
taken
up
at
high
flood
when
all
the
rapids
are
smoothed
over
to
run
on
the
upper
zambesi
the
most
formidable
cataract
in
it
morumbwa
has
only
about
twenty
feet
of
fall
in
a
distance
of
thirty
yards
and
it
must
entirely
disappear
when
the
water
stands
eighty
feet
higher
those
of
the
makololo
who
worked
on
board
the
ship
were
not
sorry
at
the
steamer
being
left
below
as
they
had
become
heartily
tired
of
cutting
the
wood
that
the
insatiable
furnace
of
the
asthmatic

was

of

a
man
of
large
enterprise
and
small
humanitybeing
anxious
to
ascertain
if
kebrabasa
could
be
navigated
made
two
slaves
fast
to
a
canoe
and
launched
it
from
chicova
into
kebrabasa
in
order
to
see
if
it
would
come
out
at
the
other
end
as
neither
slaves
nor
canoe
ever
appeared
again
his
excellency
concluded
that
kebrabasa
was
unnavigable
a
trader
had
a
large
canoe
swept
away
by
a
sudden
rise
of
the
river
and
it
was
found
without
damage
below
but
the
most
satisfactory
information
was
that
of
old
sandia
who
asserted
that
in
flood
all
kebrabasa
became
quite
smooth
and
he
had
often
seen
it
so
we
emerged
from
the
thirtyfive
or
forty
miles
of
kebrabasa
hills
into
the
chicova
plains
on
the
th
of
june
having
made
short
marches
all
the
way
the
cold
nights
caused
some
of
our

to
cough
badly
and
colds
in
this

almost
invariably
become

the
zambesi
suddenly
expands
at
chicova

assumes
the
size
and

it
has
at

near
this
point
we
found
a
large

a

of

into
our

the
blankets
nailed
to

and

of

a
dozen
fires
are
nightly
kindled
in

camp
and
these

replenished
from

to

by
the
men
who
are
awakened
by
the
cold
are
kept
burning
until
daylight
abundance
of
dry
hard
wood
is
obtained
with
little
trouble
and
burns
beautifully

the
great
business
of

and
eating
is
over
all
sit
round
the
campfires
and
engage
in
talking
or
singing
every
evening
one
of
the
batoka
plays
his
sansa
and
continues
at
it
until
far
into
the
night
he
accompanies
it
with
an
extempore
song
in
which
he
rehearses
their
deeds
ever
since
they
left
their
own
country
at
times
animated
political
discussions
spring
up
and
the
amount
of
eloquence
expended
on
these
occasions
is
amazing
the
whole
camp
is
aroused
and
the
men
shout
to
one
another
from
the
different
fires
whilst
some
whose
tongues
are
never
heard
on
any
other
subject
burst
forth
into
impassioned
speech
as
a
specimen
of
our
mode
of
marching
we
rise
about
five
or
as
soon
as
dawn
appears
take
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
the
servants
fold
up
the
blankets
and
stow
them
away
in
the
bags
they
carry
the
others
tie
their
fumbas
and
cookingpots
to
each
end
of
their
carryingsticks
which
are
borne
on
the
shoulder
the
cook
secures
the
dishes
and
all
are
on
the
path
by
sunrise
if
a
convenient
spot
can
be
found
we
halt
for
breakfast
about
nine
am
to
save
time
this
meal
is
generally
cooked
the
night
before
and
has
only
to
be
warmed
we
continue
the
march
after
breakfast
rest
a
little
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
break
off
early
in
the
afternoon
we
average
from
two
to
twoandahalf
miles
an
hour
in
a
straight
line
or
as
the
crow
flies
and
seldom
have
more
than
five
or
six
hours
a
day
of
actual
travel
this
in
a
hot
climate
is
as
much
as
a
man
can
accomplish
without
being
oppressed
and
we
always
tried
to
make
our
progress
more
a
pleasure
than
a
toil
to
hurry
over
the
ground
abuse
and
look
ferocious
at
ones
native
companions
merely
for
the
foolish
vanity
of
boasting
how
quickly
a
distance
was
accomplished
is
a
combination
of
silliness
with
absurdity
quite
odious
while
kindly
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
even
blacks
the
pleasure
of
observing
scenery
and
everything
new
as
one
moves
on
at
an
ordinary
pace
and
the
participation
in
the
most
delicious
rest
with
our
fellows
render
travelling
delightful
though
not
given
to
over
haste
we
were
a
little
surprised
to
find
that
we
could
tire
our
men
out
and
even
the
headman
who
carried
but
little
more
than
we
did
and
never
as
we
often
had
to
do
hunted
in
the
afternoon
was
no
better
than
his
comrades
our
experience
tends
to
prove
that
the
european
constitution
has
a
power
of
endurance
even
in
the
tropics
greater
than
that
of
the
hardiest
of
the
meateating
africans
after
pitching
our
camp
one
or
two
of
us
usually
go
off
to
hunt
more
as
a
matter
of
necessity
than
of
pleasure
for
the
men
as
well
as
ourselves
must
have
meat
we
prefer
to
take
a
man
with
us
to
carry
home
the
game
or
lead
the
others
to
where
it
lies
but
as
they
frequently
grumble
and
complain
of
being
tired
we
do
not
particularly
object
to
going
alone
except
that
it
involves
the
extra
labour
of
our
making
a
second
trip
to
show
the
men
where
the
animal
that
has
been
shot
is
to
be
found
when
it
is
a
couple
of
miles
off
it
is
rather
fatiguing
to
have
to
go
twice
more
especially
on
the
days
when
it
is
solely
to
supply
their
wants
that
instead
of
resting
ourselves
we
go
at
all
like
those
who
perform
benevolent
deeds
at
home
the
tired
hunter
though
trying
hard
to
live
in
charity
with
all
men
is
strongly
tempted
to
give
it
up
by
bringing
only
sufficient
meat
for
the
three
whites
and
leaving
the
rest
thus
sending
the
idle
ungrateful
poor
supperless
to
bed
and
yet
it
is
only
by
continuance
in
welldoing
even
to
the
length
of
what
the
worldlywise
call
weakness
that
the
conviction
is
produced
anywhere
that
our
motives
are
high
enough
to
secure
sincere
respect
a
jungle
of
mimosa
ebony
and
waitabit
thorn
lies
between
the
chicova
flats
and
the
cultivated
plain
on
which
stand
the
villages
of
the
chief
chitora
he
brought
us
a
present
of
food
and
drink
because
as
he
with
the
innate
politeness
of
an
african
said
he
did
not
wish
us
to
sleep
hungry
he
had
heard
of
the
doctor
when
he
passed
down
and
had
a
great
desire
to
see
and
converse
with
him
but
he
was
a
child
then
and
could
not
speak
in
the
presence
of
great
men
he
was
glad
that
he
had
seen
the
english
now
and
was
sorry
that
his
people
were
away
or
he
should
have
made
them
cook
for
us
all
his
subsequent
conduct
showed
him
to
be
sincere
many
of
the
african
women
are
particular
about
the
water
they
use
for
drinking
and
cooking
and
prefer
that
which
is
filtered
through
sand
to
secure
this
they
scrape
holes
in
the
sandbanks
beside
the
stream
and
scoop
up
the
water
which
slowly
filters
through
rather
than
take
it
from
the
equally
clear
and
limpid
river
this
practice
is
common
in
the
zambesi
the
rovuma
and
lake
nyassa
and
some
of
the
portuguese
at
tette
have
adopted
the
native
custom
and
send
canoes
to
a
low
island
in
the
middle
of
the
river
for
water
chitoras
people
also
obtained
their
supply
from
shallow
wells
in
the
sandy
bed
of
a
small
rivulet
close
to
the
village
the
habit
may
have
arisen
from
observing
the
unhealthiness
of
the
main
stream
at
certain
seasons
during
nearly
nine
months
in
the
year
ordure
is
deposited
around
countless
villages
along
the
thousands
of
miles
drained
by
the
zambesi
when
the
heavy
rains
come
down
and
sweep
the
vast
fetid
accumulation
into
the
torrents
the
water
is
polluted
with
filth
and
but
for
the
precaution
mentioned
the
natives
would
prove
themselves
as
little
fastidious
as
those
in
london
who
drink
the
abomination
poured
into
the
thames
by
reading
and
oxford
it
is
no
wonder
that
sailors
suffered
so
much
from
fever
after
drinking
african
river
water
before
the
present
admirable
system
of
condensing
it
was
adopted
in
our
navy
the
scent
of
man
is
excessively
terrible
to
game
of
all
kinds
much
more
so
probably
than
the
sight
of
him
a
herd
of
antelopes
a
hundred
yards
off
gazed
at
us
as
we
moved
along
the
winding
path
and
timidly
stood
their
ground
until
half
our
line
had
passed
but
darted
off
the
instant
they
got
the
wind
or
caught
the
flavour
of
those
who
had
gone
by
the
sport
is
all
up
with
the
hunter
who
gets
to
the
windward
of
the
african
beast
as
it
cannot
stand
even
the
distant
aroma
of
the
human
race
so
much
dreaded
by
all
wild
animals
is
this
the
fear
and
the
dread
of
man
which
the
almighty
said
to
noah
was
to
be
upon
every
beast
of
the
field
a
lion
may
while
lying
in
wait
for
his
prey
leap
on
a
human
being
as
he
would
on
any
other
animal
save
a
rhinoceros
or
an
elephant
that
happened
to
pass
or
a
lioness
when
she
has
cubs
might
attack
a
man
who
passing
up
the
wind
of
her
had
unconsciously
by
his
scent
alarmed
her
for
the
safety
of
her
whelps
or
buffaloes
amid
other
animals
might
rush
at
a
line
of
travellers
in
apprehension
of
being
surrounded
by
them
but
neither
beast
nor
snake
will
as
a
general
rule
turn
on
man
except
when
wounded
or
by
mistake
if
gorillas
unwounded
advance
to
do
battle
with
him
and
beat
their
breasts
in
defiance
they
are
an
exception
to
all
wild
beasts
known
to
us
from
the
way
an
elephant
runs
at
the
first
glance
of
man
it
is
inferred
that
this
huge
brute
though
really
king
of
beasts
would
run
even
from
a
child
our
two
donkeys
caused
as
much
admiration
as
the
three
white
men
great
was
the
astonishment
when
one
of
the
donkeys
began
to
bray
the
timid
jumped
more
than
if
a
lion
had
roared
beside
them
all
were
startled
and
stared
in
mute
amazement
at
the
harshvoiced
one
till
the
last
broken
note
was
uttered
then
on
being
assured
that
nothing
in
particular
was
meant
they
looked
at
each
other
and
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
at
their
common
surprise
when
one
donkey
stimulated
the
other
to
try
his
vocal
powers
the
interest
felt
by
the
startled
visitors
must
have
equalled
that
of
the
londoners
when
they
first
crowded
to
see
the
famous
hippopotamus
we
were
now
when
we
crossed
the
boundary
rivulet
nyamatarara
out
of
chicova
and
amongst
sandstone
rocks
similar
to
those
which
prevail
between
lupata
and
kebrabasa
in
the
latter
gorge
as
already
mentioned
igneous
and
syenitic
masses
have
been
acted
on
by
some
great
fiery
convulsion
of
nature
the
strata
are
thrown
into
a
huddled
heap
of
confusion
the
coal
has
of
course
disappeared
in
kebrabasa
but
is
found
again
in
chicova
tette
grey
sandstone
is
common
about
sinjere
and
wherever
it
is
seen
with
fossil
wood
upon
it
coal
lies
beneath
and
here
as
at
chicova
some
seams
crop
out
on
the
banks
of
the
zambesi
looking
southwards
the
country
is
open
plain
and
woodland
with
detached
hills
and
mountains
in
the
distance
but
the
latter
are
too
far
off
the
natives
say
for
them
to
know
their
names
the
principal
hills
on
our
right
as
we
look
up
stream
are
from
six
to
twelve
miles
away
and
occasionally
they
send
down
spurs
to
the
river
with
brooks
flowing
through
their
narrow
valleys
the
banks
of
the
zambesi
show
two
well
defined
terraces
the
first
or
lowest
being
usually
narrow
and
of
great
fertility
while
the
upper
one
is
a
dry
grassy
plain
a
thorny
jungle
or
a
mopane
bauhinia
forest
one
of
these
plains
near
the
kafue
is
covered
with
the
large
stumps
and
trunks
of
a
petrified
forest
we
halted
a
couple
of
days
by
the
fine
stream
sinjere
which
comes
from
the
chirobyroby
hills
about
eight
miles
to
the
north
many
lumps
of
coal
brought
down
by
the
rapid
current
lie
in
its
channel
the
natives
never
seem
to
have
discovered
that
coal
would
burn
and
when
informed
of
the
fact
shook
their
heads
smiled
incredulously
and
said
kodi
really
evidently
regarding
it
as
a
mere
travellers
tale
they
were
astounded
to
see
it
burning
freely
on
our
fire
of
wood
they
told
us
that
plenty
of
it
was
seen
among
the
hills
but
being
long
ago
aware
that
we
were
now
in
an
immense
coalfield
we
did
not
care
to
examine
it
further
a
dyke
of
black
basaltic
rock
called
kakolole
crosses
the
river
near
the
mouth
of
the
sinjere
but
it
has
two
open
gateways
in
it
of
from
sixty
to
eighty
yards
in
breadth
and
the
channel
is
very
deep
on
a
shallow
sandbank
under
the
dyke
lay
a
herd
of
hippopotami
in
fancied
security
the
young
ones
were
playing
with
each
other
like
young
puppies
climbing
on
the
backs
of
their
dams
trying
to
take
hold
of
one
another
by
the
jaws
and
tumbling
over
into
the
water
mbia
one
of
the
makololo
waded
across
to
within
a
dozen
yards
of
the
drowsy
beasts
and
shot
the
father
of
the
herd
who
being
very
fat
soon
floated
and
was
secured
at
the
village
below
the
headman
of
the
village
visited
us
while
we
were
at
breakfast
he
wore
a
black
ife
wig
and
a
printed
shirt
after
a
short
silence
he
said
to
masakasa
you
are
with
the
white
people
so
why
do
you
not
tell
them
to
give
me
a
cloth
we
are
strangers
answered
masakasa
why
do
you
not
bring
us
some
food
he
took
the
plain
hint
and
brought
us
two
fowls
in
order
that
we
should
not
report
that
in
passing
him
we
got
nothing
to
eat
and
as
usual
we
gave
a
cloth
in
return
in
reference
to
the
hippopotamus
he
would
make
no
demand
but
said
he
would
take
what
we
chose
to
give
him
the
men
gorged
themselves
with
meat
for
two
days
and
cut
large
quantities
into
long
narrow
strips
which
they
halfdried
and
halfroasted
on
wooden
frames
over
the
fire
much
game
is
taken
in
this
neighbourhood
in
pitfalls
sharppointed
stakes
are
set
in
the
bottom
on
which
the
game
tumbles
and
gets
impaled
the
natives
are
careful
to
warn
strangers
of
these
traps
and
also
of
the
poisoned
beams
suspended
on
the
tall
trees
for
the
purpose
of
killing
elephants
and
hippopotami
it
is
not
difficult
to
detect
the
pitfalls
after
ones
attention
has
been
called
to
them
but
in
places
where
they
are
careful
to
carry
the
earth
off
to
a
distance
and
a
person
is
not
thinking
of
such
things
a
sudden
descent
of
nine
feet
is
an
experience
not
easily
forgotten
by
the
traveller
the
sensations
of
one
thus
instantaneously
swallowed
up
by
the
earth
are
peculiar
a
momentary
suspension
of
consciousness
is
followed
by
the
rustling
sound
of
a
shower
of
sand
and
dry
grass
and
the
halfbewildered
thought
of
where
he
is
and
how
he
came
into
darkness
reason
awakes
to
assure
him
that
he
must
have
come
down
through
that
small
opening
of
daylight
overhead
and
that
he
is
now
where
a
hippopotamus
ought
to
have
been
the
descent
of
a
hippopotamus
pitfall
is
easy
but
to
get
out
again
into
the
upper
air
is
a
work
of
labour
the
sides
are
smooth
and
treacherous
and
the
cross
reeds
which
support
the
covering
break
in
the
attempt
to
get
out
by
clutching
them
a
cry
from
the
depths
is
unheard
by
those
around
and
it
is
only
by
repeated
and
most
desperate
efforts
that
the
buried
alive
can
regain
the
upper
world
at
tette
we
are
told
of
a
white
hunter
of
unusually
small
stature
who
plumped
into
a
pit
while
stalking
a
guineafowl
on
a
tree
it
was
the
labour
of
an
entire
forenoon
to
get
out
and
he
was
congratulating
himself
on
his
escape
and
brushing
off
the
clay
from
his
clothes
when
down
he
went
into
a
second
pit
which
happened
as
is
often
the
case
to
be
close
beside
the
first
and
it
was
evening
before
he
could
work
himself
out
of
that
elephants
and
buffaloes
seldom
return
to
the
river
by
the
same
path
on
two
successive
nights
they
become
so
apprehensive
of
danger
from
this
human
art
an
old
elephant
will
walk
in
advance
of
the
herd
and
uncover
the
pits
with
his
trunk
that
the
others
may
see
the
openings
and
tread
on
firm
ground
female
elephants
are
generally
the
victims
more
timid
by
nature
than
the
males
and
very
motherly
in
their
anxiety
for
their
calves
they
carry
their
trunks
up
trying
every
breeze
for
fancied
danger
which
often
in
reality
lies
at
their
feet
the
tusker
fearing
less
keeps
his
trunk
down
and
warned
in
time
by
that
exquisitely
sensitive
organ
takes
heed
to
his
ways
our
camp
on
the
sinjere
stood
under
a
widespreading
wild
figtree
from
the
numbers
of
this
family
of
large
size
dotted
over
the
country
the
fig
or
banyan
species
would
seem
to
have
been
held
sacred
in
africa
from
the
remotest
times
the
soil
teemed
with
white
ants
whose
clay
tunnels
formed
to
screen
them
from
the
eyes
of
birds
thread
over
the
ground
up
the
trunks
of
trees
and
along
the
branches
from
which
the
little
architects
clear
away
all
rotten
or
dead
wood
very
often
the
exact
shape
of
branches
is
left
in
tunnels
on
the
ground
and
not
a
bit
of
the
wood
inside
the
first
night
we
passed
here
these
destructive
insects
ate
through
our
grassbeds
and
attacked
our
blankets
and
certain
large
redheaded
ones
even
bit
our
flesh
on
some
days
not
a
single
white
ant
is
to
be
seen
abroad
and
on
others
and
during
certain
hours
they
appear
out
of
doors
in
myriads
and
work
with
extraordinary
zeal
and
energy
in
carrying
bits
of
dried
grass
down
into
their
nests
during
these
busy
reapingfits
the
lizards
and
birds
have
a
good
time
of
it
and
enjoy
a
rich
feast
at
the
expense
of
thousands
of
hapless
workmen
and
when
they
swarm
they
are
caught
in
countless
numbers
by
the
natives
and
their
roasted
bodies
are
spoken
of
in
an
unctuous
manner
as
resembling
grains
of
soft
rice
fried
in
delicious
fresh
oil
a
strong
marauding
party
of
large
black
ants
attacked
a
nest
of
white
ones
near
the
camp
as
the
contest
took
place
beneath
the
surface
we
could
not
see
the
order
of
the
battle
but
it
soon
became
apparent
that
the
blacks
had
gained
the
day
and
sacked
the
white
town
for
they
returned
in
triumph
bearing
off
the
eggs
and
choice
bits
of
the
bodies
of
the
vanquished
a
gift
analogous
to
that
of
language
has
not
been
withheld
from
ants
if
part
of
their
building
is
destroyed
an
official
is
seen
coming
out
to
examine
the
damage
and
after
a
careful
survey
of
the
ruins
he
chirrups
a
few
clear
and
distinct
notes
and
a
crowd
of
workers
begin
at
once
to
repair
the
breach
when
the
work
is
completed
another
order
is
given
and
the
workmen
retire
as
will
appear
on
removing
the
soft
freshlybuilt
portion
we
tried
to
sleep
one
rainy
might
in
a
native
hut
but
could
not
because
of
attacks
by
the
fighting
battalions
of
a
very
small
species
of
formica
not
more
than
onesixteenth
of
an
inch
in
length
it
soon
became
obvious
that
they
were
under
regular
discipline
and
even
attempting
to
carry
out
the
skilful
plans
and
stratagems
of
some
eminent
leader
our
hands
and
necks
were
the
first
objects
of
attack
large
bodies
of
these
little
pests
were
massed
in
silence
round
the
point
to
be
assaulted
we
could
hear
the
sharp
shrill
word
of
command
two
or
three
times
repeated
though
until
then
we
had
not
believed
in
the
vocal
power
of
an
ant
the
instant
after
we
felt
the
storming
hosts
range
over
head
and
neck
biting
the
tender
skin
clinging
with
a
deathgrip
to
the
hair
and
parting
with
their
jaws
rather
than
quit
their
hold
on
our
lying
down
again
in
the
hope
of
their
having
been
driven
off
no
sooner
was
the
light
out
and
all
still
than
the
manoeuvre
was
repeated
clear
and
audible
orders
were
issued
and
the
assault
renewed
it
was
as
hard
to
sleep
in
that
hut
as
in
the
trenches
before
sebastopol
the
white
ant
being
a
vegetable
feeder
devours
articles
of
vegetable
origin
only
and
leather
which
by
tanning
is
imbued
with
a
vegetable
flavour
a
man
may
be
rich
today
and
poor
tomorrow
from
the
ravages
of
white
ants
said
a
portuguese
merchant
if
he
gets
sick
and
unable
to
look
after
his
goods
his
slaves
neglect
them
and
they
are
soon
destroyed
by
these
insects
the
reddish
ant
in
the
west
called
drivers
crossed
our
path
daily
in
solid
columns
an
inch
wide
and
never
did
the
pugnacity
of
either
man
or
beast
exceed
theirs
it
is
a
sufficient
cause
of
war
if
you
only
approach
them
even
by
accident
some
turn
out
of
the
ranks
and
stand
with
open
mandibles
or
charging
with
extended
jaws
bite
with
savage
ferocity
when
hunting
we
lighted
among
them
too
often
while
we
were
intent
on
the
game
and
without
a
thought
of
ants
they
quietly
covered
us
from
head
to
foot
then
all
began
to
bite
at
the
same
instant
seizing
a
piece
of
the
skin
with
their
powerful
pincers
they
twisted
themselves
round
with
it
as
if
determined
to
tear
it
out
their
bites
are
so
terribly
sharp
that
the
bravest
must
run
and
then
strip
to
pick
off
those
that
still
cling
with
their
hooked
jaws
as
with
steel
forceps
this
kind
abounds
in
damp
places
and
is
usually
met
with
on
the
banks
of
streams
we
have
not
heard
of
their
actually
killing
any
animal
except
the
python
and
that
only
when
gorged
and
quite
lethargic
but
they
soon
clear
away
any
dead
animal
matter
this
appears
to
be
their
principal
food
and
their
use
in
the
economy
of
nature
is
clearly
in
the
scavenger
line
we
started
from
the
sinjere
on
the
th
of
june
our
men
carrying
with
them
bundles
of
hippopotamus
meat
for
sale
and
for
future
use
we
rested
for
breakfast
opposite
the
kakolole
dyke
which
confines
the
channel
west
of
the
manyerere
mountain
a
rogue
monkey
the
largest
by
far
that
we
ever
saw
and
very
fat
and
tame
walked
off
leisurely
from
a
garden
as
we
approached
the
monkey
is
a
sacred
animal
in
this
region
and
is
never
molested
or
killed
because
the
people
believe
devoutly
that
the
souls
of
their
ancestors
now
occupy
these
degraded
forms
and
anticipate
that
they
themselves
must
sooner
or
later
be
transformed
in
like
manner
a
future
as
cheerless
for
the
black
as
the
spiritrappers
heaven
is
for
the
whites
the
gardens
are
separated
from
each
other
by
a
single
row
of
small
stones
a
few
handfuls
of
grass
or
a
slight
furrow
made
by
the
hoe
some
are
enclosed
by
a
reed
fence
of
the
flimsiest
construction
yet
sufficient
to
keep
out
the
ever
wary
hippopotamus
who
dreads
a
trap
his
extreme
caution
is
taken
advantage
of
by
the
women
who
hang
as
a
miniature
trapbeam
a
kigelia
fruit
with
a
bit
of
stick
in
the
end
this
protects
the
maize
of
which
he
is
excessively
fond
the
quantity
of
hippopotamus
meat
eaten
by
our
men
made
some
of
them
ill
and
our
marches
were
necessarily
short
after
three
hours
travel
on
the
th
we
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
at
the
village
of
chasiribera
on
a
rivulet
flowing
through
a
beautiful
valley
to
the
north
which
is
bounded
by
magnificent
mountainranges

forms
the
southeastern
angle
of
the
range
on
the
th
june
we
were
at
the
flourishing
village
of
senga
under
the
headman
manyame
which
lies
at
the
foot
of
the
mount
motemwa
nearly
all
the
mountains
in
this
country
are
covered
with
open
forest
and
grass
in
colour
according
to
the
season
green
or
yellow
many
are
between
and
feet
high
with
the
sky
line
fringed
with
trees
the
rocks
show
just
sufficiently
for
one
to
observe
their
stratification
or
their
granitic
form
and
though
not
covered
with
dense
masses
of
climbing
plants
like
those
in
moister
eastern
climates
there
is
still
the
idea
conveyed
that
most
of
the
steep
sides
are
fertile
and
none
give
the
impression
of
that
barrenness
which
in
northern
mountains
suggests
the
idea
that
the
bones
of
the
world
are
sticking
through
its
skin
the
villagers
reported
that
we
were
on
the
footsteps
of
a
portuguese
half
caste
who
at
senga
lately
tried
to
purchase
ivory
but
in
consequence
of
his
having
murdered
a
chief
near
zumbo
and
twenty
of
his
men
the
people
declined
to
trade
with
him
he
threatened
to
take
the
ivory
by
force
if
they
would
not
sell
it
but
that
same
night
the
ivory
and
the
women
were
spirited
out
of
the
village
and
only
a
large
body
of
armed
men
remained
the
trader
fearing
that
he
might
come
off
second
best
if
it
came
to
blows
immediately
departed
chikwanitsela
or
sekuanangila
is
the
paramount
chief
of
some
fifty
miles
of
the
northern
bank
of
the
zambesi
in
this
locality
he
lives
on
the
opposite
or
southern
side
and
there
his
territory
is
still
more
extensive
we
sent
him
a
present
from
senga
and
were
informed
by
a
messenger
next
morning
that
he
had
a
cough
and
could
not
come
over
to
see
us
and
has
his
present
a
cough
too
remarked
one
of
our
party
that
it
does
not
come
to
us
is
this
the
way
your
chief
treats
strangers
receives
their
present
and
sends
them
no
food
in
return
our
men
thought
chikwanitsela
an
uncommonly
stingy
fellow
but
as
it
was
possible
that
some
of
them
might
yet
wish
to
return
this
way
they
did
not
like
to
scold
him
more
than
this
which
was
sufficiently
to
the
point
men
and
women
were
busily
engaged
in
preparing
the
ground
for
the
november
planting
large
game
was
abundant
herds
of
elephants
and
buffaloes
came
down
to
the
river
in
the
night
but
were
a
long
way
off
by
daylight
they
soon
adopt
this
habit
in
places
where
they
are
hunted
the
plains
we
travel
over
are
constantly
varying
in
breadth
according
as
the
furrowed
and
wooded
hills
approach
or
recede
from
the
river
on
the
southern
side
we
see
the
hill
bungwe
and
the
long
level
wooded
ridge
nyangombe
the
first
of
a
series
bending
from
the
se
to
the
nw
past
the
zambesi
we
shot
an
old
pallah
on
the
th
and
found
that
the
poor
animal
had
been
visited
with
more
than
the
usual
share
of
animal
afflictions
he
was
stoneblind
in
both
eyes
had
several
tumours
and
a
broken
leg
which
showed
no
symptoms
of
ever
having
begun
to
heal
wild
animals
sometimes
suffer
a
great
deal
from
disease
and
wearily
drag
on
a
miserable
existence
before
relieved
of
it
by
some
ravenous
beast
once
we
drove
off
a
maneless
lion
and
lioness
from
a
dead
buffalo
which
had
been
in
the
last
stage
of
a
decline
they
had
watched
him
staggering
to
the
river
to
quench
his
thirst
and
sprang
on
him
as
he
was
crawling
up
the
bank
one
had
caught
him
by
the
throat
and
the
other
by
his
high
projecting
backbone
which
was
broken
by
the
lions
powerful
fangs
the
struggle
if
any
must
have
been
short
they
had
only
eaten
the
intestines
when
we
frightened
them
off
it
is
curious
that
this
is
the
part
that
wild
animals
always
begin
with
and
that
it
is
also
the
first
choice
of
our
men
were
it
not
a
wise
arrangement
that
only
the
strongest
males
should
continue
the
breed
one
could
hardly
help
pitying
the
solitary
buffalo
expelled
from
the
herd
for
some
physical
blemish
or
on
account
of
the
weakness
of
approaching
old
age
banished
from
female
society
he
naturally
becomes
morose
and
savage
the
necessary
watchfulness
against
enemies
is
now
never
shared
by
others
disgusted
he
passes
into
a
state
of
chronic
war
with
all
who
enjoy
life
and
the
sooner
after
his
expulsion
that
he
fills
the
lions
or
the
wilddogs
maw
the
better
for
himself
and
for
the
peace
of
the
country
we
encamped
on
the
th
of
june
at
a
spot
where
dr
livingstone
on
his
journey
from
the
west
to
the
east
coast
was
formerly
menaced
by
a
chief
named
mpende
no
offence
had
been
committed
against
him
but
he
had
firearms
and
with
the
express
object
of
showing
his
power
he
threatened
to
attack
the
strangers
mpendes
counsellors
having
however
found
out
that
dr
livingstone
belonged
to
a
tribe
of
whom
they
had
heard
that
they
loved
the
black
man
and
did
not
make
slaves
his
conduct
at
once
changed
from
enmity
to
kindness
and
as
the
place
was
one
well
selected
for
defence
it
was
perhaps
quite
as
well
for
mpende
that
he
decided
as
he
did
three
of
his
counsellors
now
visited
us
and
we
gave
them
a
handsome
present
for
their
chief
who
came
himself
next
morning
and
made
us
a
present
of
a
goat
a
basket
of
boiled
maize
and
another
of
vetches
a
few
miles
above
this
the
headman
chilondo
of
nyamasusa
apologized
for
not
formerly
lending
us
canoes
he
was
absent
and
his
children
were
to
blame
for
not
telling
him
when
the
doctor
passed
he
did
not
refuse
the
canoes
the
sight
of
our
men
now
armed
with
muskets
had
a
great
effect
without
any
bullying
firearms
command
respect
and
lead
men
to
be
reasonable
who
might
otherwise
feel
disposed
to
be
troublesome
nothing
however
our
fracas
with
mpende
excepted
could
be
more
peaceful
than
our
passage
through
this
tract
of
country
in
we
then
had
nothing
to
excite
the
cupidity
of
the
people
and
the
men
maintained
themselves
either
by
selling
elephants
meat
or
by
exhibiting
feats
of
foreign
dancing
most
of
the
people
were
very
generous
and
friendly
but
the
banyai
nearer
to
tette
than
this
stopped
our
march
with
a
threatening
wardance
one
of
our
party
terrified
at
this
ran
away
as
we
thought
insane
and
could
not
after
a
painful
search
of
three
days
be
found
the
banyai
evidently
touched
by
our
distress
allowed
us
to
proceed
through
a
man
we
left
on
an
island
a
little
below
mpendes
we
subsequently
learned
that
poor
monaheng
had
fled
thither
and
had
been
murdered
by
the
headman
for
no
reason
except
that
he
was
defenceless
this
headman
had
since
become
odious
to
his
countrymen
and
had
been
put
to
death
by
them
on
the
rd
of
june
we
entered
pangolas
principal
village
which
is
upwards
of
a
mile
from
the
river
the
ruins
of
a
mud
wall
showed
that
a
rude
attempt
had
been
made
to
imitate
the
portuguese
style
of
building
we
established
ourselves
under
a
stately
wild
figtree
round
whose
trunk
witchcraft
medicine
had
been
tied
to
protect
from
thieves
the
honey
of
the
wild
bees
which
had
their
hive
in
one
of
the
limbs
this
is
a
common
device
the
charm
or
the
medicine
is
purchased
of
the
dice
doctors
and
consists
of
a
strip
of
palmleaf
smeared
with
something
and
adorned
with
a
few
bits
of
grass
wood
or
roots
it
is
tied
round
the
tree
and
is
believed
to
have
the
power
of
inflicting
disease
and
death
on
the
thief
who
climbs
over
it
superstition
is
thus
not
without
its
uses
in
certain
states
of
society
it
prevents
many
crimes
and
misdemeanours
which
would
occur
but
for
the
salutary
fear
that
it
produces
pangola
arrived
tipsy
and
talkativewe
are
friends
we
are
great
friends
i
have
brought
you
a
basket
of
green
maizehere
it
is
we
thanked
him
and
handed
him
two
fathoms
of
cotton
cloth
four
times
the
marketvalue
of
his
present
no
he
would
not
take
so
small
a
present
he
wanted
a
doublebarrelled
rifleone
of
dixons
best
we
are
friends
you
know
we
are
all
friends
together
but
although
we
were
willing
to
admit
that
we
could
not
give
him
our
best
rifle
so
he
went
off
in
high
dudgeon
early
next
morning
as
we
were
commencing
divine
service
pangola
returned
sober
we
explained
to
him
that
we
wished
to
worship
god
and
invited
him
to
remain
he
seemed
frightened
and
retired
but
after
service
he
again
importuned
us
for
the
rifle
it
was
of
no
use
telling
him
that
we
had
a
long
journey
before
us
and
needed
it
to
kill
game
for
ourselveshe
too
must
obtain
meat
for
himself
and
people
for
they
sometimes
suffered
from
hunger
he
then
got
sulky
and
his
people
refused
to
sell
food
except
at
extravagant
prices
knowing
that
we
had
nothing
to
eat
they
felt
sure
of
starving
us
into
compliance
but
two
of
our
young
men
having
gone
off
at
sunrise
shot
a
fine
waterbuck
and
down
came
the
provision
market
to
the
lower
figure
they
even
became
eager
to
sell
but
our
men
were
angry
with
them
for
trying
compulsion
and
would
not
buy
black
greed
had
outwitted
itself
as
happens
often
with
white
cupidity
and
not
only
here
did
the
traits
of
africans
remind
us
of

the
notoriously

wide
disposition
to
take
an
unfair
advantage
of
a
mans

shows
that
the

are
pretty
widely
diffused
among
all
races
it
may
not
be
granted
that
the
same
blood
flows
in

veins
or
that
all
have
descended
from

the

has
no

that
practically
the

pangola

is
called

asenga

all
appear
to
be
of
the

as
the
rest
of
the
manganja
and
maravi
formerly
all
the
manganja
were
united
under
the
government
of
their
great
chief
undi
whose
empire
extended
from
lake
shirwa
to
the
river
loangwa
but
after
undis
death
it
fell
to
pieces
and
a
large
portion
of
it
on
the
zambesi
was
absorbed
by
their
powerful
southern
neighbours
the
banyai
this
has
been
the
inevitable
fate
of
every
african
empire
from
time
immemorial
a
chief
of
more
than
ordinary
ability
arises
and
subduing
all
his
less
powerful
neighbours
founds
a
kingdom
which
he
governs
more

wisely
till
he
dies
his
successor
not
having
the
talents
of
the
conqueror
cannot
retain
the
dominion
and
some
of
the
abler
underchiefs
set
up
for
themselves
and
in
a
few
years
the
remembrance
only
of
the
empire
remains
this
which
may
be
considered
as
the
normal
state
of
african
society
gives
rise
to
frequent
and
desolating
wars
and
the
people
long
in
vain
for
a
power
able
to
make
all
dwell
in
peace
in
this
light
a
european
colony
would
be
considered
by
the
natives
as
an
inestimable
boon
to
intertropical
africa
thousands
of
industrious
natives
would
gladly
settle
round
it
and
engage
in
that
peaceful
pursuit
of
agriculture
and
trade
of
which
they
are
so
fond
and
undistracted
by
wars
or
rumours
of
wars
might
listen
to
the
purifying
and
ennobling
truths
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
the
manganja
on
the
zambesi
like
their
countrymen
on
the
shire
are
fond
of
agriculture
and
in
addition
to
the
usual
varieties
of
food
cultivate
tobacco
and
cotton
in
quantities
more
than
equal
to
their
wants
to
the
question
would
they
work
for
europeans
an
affirmative
answer
may
be
given
if
the
europeans
belong
to
the
class
which
can
pay
a
reasonable
price
for
labour
and
not
to
that
of
adventurers
who
want
employment
for
themselves
all
were
particularly
well
clothed
from
sandias
to
pangolas
and
it
was
noticed
that
all
the
cloth
was
of
native
manufacture
the
product
of
their
own
looms
in
senga
a
great
deal
of
iron
is
obtained
from
the
ore
and
manufactured
very
cleverly
as
is
customary
when
a
party
of
armed
strangers
visits
the
village
pangola
took
the
precaution
of
sleeping
in
one
of
the
outlying
hamlets
no
one
ever
knows
or
at
any
rate
will
tell
where
the
chief
sleeps
he
came
not
next
morning
so
we
went
our
way
but
in
a
few
moments
we
saw
the
rifleloving
chief
approaching
with
some
armed
men
before
meeting
us
he
left
the
path
and
drew
up
his
following
under
a
tree
expecting
us
to
halt
and
give
him
a
chance
of
bothering
us
again
but
having
already
had
enough
of
that
we
held
right
on
he
seemed
dumbfoundered
and
could
hardly
believe
his
own
eyes
for
a
few
seconds
he
was
speechless
but
at
last
recovered
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
say
you
are
passing
pangola
do
you
not
see
pangola
mbia
was
just
going
by
at
the
time
with
the
donkey
and
proud
of
every
opportunity
of
airing
his
small
stock
of
english
shouted
in
reply
all
right
then
get

on
the
th
june
we
breakfasted
at
zumbo
on
the
left
bank
of
the
loangwa
near
the
ruins
of
some
ancient
portuguese
houses
the
loangwa
was
too
deep
to
be
forded
and
there
were
no
canoes
on
our
side
seeing
two
small
ones
on
the
opposite
shore
near
a
few
recently
erected
huts
of
two
halfcastes
from
tette
we
halted
for
the
ferrymen
to
come
over
from
their
movements
it
was
evident
that
they
were
in
a
state
of
rollicking
drunkenness
having
a
waterproof
cloak
which
could
be
inflated
into
a
tiny
boat
we
sent
mantlanyane
across
in
it
three
half
intoxicated
slaves
then
brought
us
the
shaky
canoes
which
we
lashed
together
and
manned
with
our
own
canoemen
five
men
were
all
that
we
could
carry
over
at
a
time
and
after
four
trips
had
been
made
the
slaves
began
to
clamour
for
drink
not
receiving
any
as
we
had
none
to
give
they
grew
more
insolent
and
declared
that
not
another
man
should
cross
that
day
sininyane
was
remonstrating
with
them
when
a
loaded
musket
was
presented
at
him
by
one
of
the
trio
in
an
instant
the
gun
was
out
of
the
rascals
hands
a
rattling
shower
of
blows
fell
on
his
back
and
he
took
an
involuntary
header
into
the
river
he
crawled
up
the
bank
a
sad
and
sober
man
and
all
three
at
once
tumbled
from
the
height
of
saucy
swagger
to
a
low
depth
of
slavish
abjectness
the
musket
was
found
to
have
an
enormous
charge
and
might
have
blown
our
man
to
pieces
but
for
the
promptitude
with
which
his
companions
administered
justice
in
a
lawless
land
we
were
all
ferried
safely
across
by
oclock
in
the
evening
in
illustration
of
what
takes
place
where
no
government
or
law
exists
the
two
halfcastes
to
whom
these
men
belonged
left
tette
with
four
hundred
slaves
armed
with
the
old
sepoy
brown
bess
to
hunt
elephants
and
trade
in
ivory
on
our
way
up
we
heard
from
natives
of
their
lawless
deeds
and
again
on
our
way
down
from
several
who
had
been
eyewitnesses
of
the
principal
crime
and
all
reports
substantially
agreed
the
story
is
a
sad
one
after
the
traders
reached
zumbo
one
of
them
called
by
the
natives
sequasha
entered
into
a
plot
with
the
disaffected
headman
namakusuru
to
kill
his
chief
mpangwe
in
order
that
namakusuru
might
seize
upon
the
chieftainship
and
for
the
murder
of
mpangwe
the
trader
agreed
to
receive
ten
large
tusks
of
ivory
sequasha
with
a
picked
party
of
armed
slaves
went
to
visit
mpangwe
who
received
him
kindly
and
treated
him
with
all
the
honour
and
hospitality
usually
shown
to
distinguished
strangers
and
the
women
busied
themselves
in
cooking
the
best
of
their
provisions
for
the
repast
to
be
set
before
him
of
this
and
also
of
the
beer
the
halfcaste
partook
heartily
mpangwe
was
then
asked
by
sequasha
to
allow
his
men
to
fire
their
guns
in
amusement
innocent
of
any
suspicion
of
treachery
and
anxious
to
hear
the
report
of
firearms
mpangwe
at
once
gave
his
consent
and
the
slaves
rose
and
poured
a
murderous
volley
into
the
merry
group
of
unsuspecting
spectators
instantly
killing
the
chief
and
twenty
of
his
people
the
survivors
fled
in
horror
the
children
and
young
women
were
seized
as
slaves
and
the
village
sacked
sequasha
sent
the
message
to
namakusuru
i
have
killed
the
lion
that
troubled
you
come
and
let
us
talk
over
the
matter
he
came
and
brought
the
ivory
no
said
the
halfcaste
let
us
divide
the
land
and
he
took
the
larger
share
for
himself
and
compelled
the
wouldbe
usurper
to
deliver
up
his
bracelets
in
token
of
subjection
on
becoming
the
child
or
vassal
of
sequasha
these
were
sent
in
triumph
to
the
authorities
at
tette
the
governor
of
quillimane
had
told
us
that
he
had
received
orders
from
lisbon
to
take
advantage
of
our
passing
to
reestablish
zumbo
and
accordingly
these
traders
had
built
a
small
stockade
on
the
rich
plain
of
the
right
bank
of
loangwa
a
mile
above
the
site
of
the
ancient
mission
church
of
zumbo
as
part
of
the
royal
policy
the
bloodshed
was
quite
unnecessary
because
the
land
at
zumbo
having
of
old
been
purchased
the
natives
would
have
always
of
their
own
accord
acknowledged
the
right
thus
acquired
they
pointed
it
out
to
dr
livingstone
in
that
though
they
were
cultivating
it
is
was
not
theirs
but
white
mans
land
sequasha
and
his
mate
had
left
their
ivory
in
charge
of
some
of
their
slaves
who
in
the
absence
of
their
masters
were
now
having
a
gay
time
of
it
and
getting
drunk
every
day
with
the
produce
of
the
sacked
villages
the
head
slave
came
and
begged
for
the
musket
of
the
delinquent
ferryman
which
was
returned
he
thought
his
master
did
perfectly
right
to
kill
mpangwe
when
asked
to
do
it
for
the
fee
of
ten
tusks
and
he
even
justified
it
thus
if
a
man
invites
you
to
eat
will
you
not
partake
we
continued
our
journey
on
the
th
of
june
game
was
extremely
abundant
and
there
were
many
lions
mbia
drove
one
off
from
his
feast
on
a
wild
pig
and
appropriated
what
remained
of
the
pork
to
his
own
use
lions
are
particularly
fond
of
the
flesh
of
wild
pigs
and
zebras
and
contrive
to
kill
a
large
number
of
these
animals
in
the
afternoon
we
arrived
at
the
village
of
the
female
chief
mamburuma
but
she
herself
was
now
living
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
some
of
her
people
called
and
said
she
had
been
frightened
by
seeing
her
son
and
other
children
killed
by
sequasha
and
had
fled
to
the
other
bank
but
when
her
heart
was
healed
she
would
return
and
live
in
her
own
village
and
among
her
own
people
she
constantly
inquired
of
the
black
traders
who
came
up
the
river
if
they
had
any
news
of
the
white
man
who
passed
with
the
oxen
he
has
gone
down
into
the
sea
was
their
reply
but
we
belong
to
the
same
people
oh
no
you
need
not
tell
me
that
he
takes
no
slaves
but
wishes
peace
you
are
not
of
his
tribe
this
antislavery
character
excites
such
universal
attention
that
any
missionary
who
winked
at
the
gigantic
evils
involved
in
the
slavetrade
would
certainly
fail
to
produce
any
good
impression
on
the
native
mind

we
left
the
river
here
and
proceeded
up
the
valley
which
leads
to
the
mburuma
or
mohango
pass
the
nights
were
cold
and
on
the
th
of
june
the
thermometer
was
as
low
as
degrees
at
sunrise
we
passed
through
a
village
of
twenty
large
huts
which
sequasha
had
attacked
on
his
return
from
the
murder
of
the
chief
mpangwe
he
caught
the
women
and
children
for
slaves
and
carried
off
all
the
food
except
a
huge
basket
of
bran
which
the
natives
are
wont
to
save
against
a
time
of
famine
his
slaves
had
broken
all
the
waterpots
and
the
millstones
for
grinding
meal
the
buazetrees
and
bamboos
are
now
seen
on
the
hills
but
the
jujube
or
zisyphus
which
has
evidently
been
introduced
from
india
extends
no
further
up
the
river
we
had
been
eating
this
fruit
which
having
somewhat
the
taste
of
apples
the
portuguese
call
macaas
all
the
way
from
tette
and
here
they
were
larger
than
usual
though
immediately
beyond
they
ceased
to
be
found
no
mangotree
either
is
to
be
met
with
beyond
this
point
because
the
portuguese
traders
never
established
themselves
anywhere
beyond
zumbo
tsetse
flies
are
more
numerous
and
troublesome
than
we
have
ever
before
found
them
they
accompany
us
on
the
march
often
buzzing
round
our
heads
like
a
swarm
of
bees
they
are
very
cunning
and
when
intending
to
bite
alight
so
gently
that
their
presence
is
not
perceived
till
they
thrust
in
their
lancelike
proboscis
the
bite
is
acute
but
the
pain
is
over
in
a
moment
it
is
followed
by
a
little
of
the
disagreeable
itching
of
the
mosquitos
bite
this
fly
invariably
kills
all
domestic
animals
except

and

and
the
wild
animals

we
ourselves
were
severely
bitten
on
this
pass
and
so
were
our
donkeys
but
neither
suffered
from
any
after
effects
water
is
scarce
in
the
mburuma
pass
except
during
the
rainy
season
we
however
halted
beside
some
fine
springs
in
the
bed
of
the
now
dry
rivulet
podebode
which
is
continued
down
to
the
end
of
the
pass
and
yields
water
at
intervals
in
pools
here
we
remained
a
couple
of
days
in
consequence
of
the
severe
illness
of
dr
kirk
he
had
several
times
been
attacked
by
fever
and
observed
that
when
we
were
on
the
cool
heights
he
was
comfortable
but
when
we
happened
to
descend
from
a
high
to
a
lower
altitude
he
felt
chilly
though
the
temperature
in
the
latter
case
was
degrees
higher
than
it
was
above
he
had
been
trying
different
medicines
of
reputed
efficacy
with
a
view
to
ascertain
whether
other
combinations
might
not
be
superior
to
the
preparation
we
generally
used
in
halting
by
this
water
he
suddenly
became
blind
and
unable
to
stand
from
faintness
the
men
with
great
alacrity
prepared
a
grassy
bed
on
which
we
laid
our
companion
with
the
sad
forebodings
which
only
those
who
have
tended
the
sick
in
a
wild
country
can
realize
we
feared
that
in
experimenting
he
had
overdrugged
himself
but
we
gave
him
a
dose
of
our
fever
pills
on
the
third
day
he
rode
the
one
of
the
two
donkeys
that
would
allow
itself
to
be
mounted
and
on
the
sixth
he
marched
as
well
as
any
of
us
this
case
is
mentioned
in
order
to
illustrate
what
we
have
often
observed
that
moving
the
patient
from
place
to
place
is
most
conducive
to
the
cure
and
the
more

supplied
with

by
the
pools
in
the
podebode
we
again
joined
the
zambesi
at
the
confluence
of
the
rivulet
when
passing
through
a
dry
district
the
native
hunter
knows
where
to
expect
water
by
the
animals
he
sees
the
presence
of
the
gemsbuck
duiker
or
diver
springbucks
or
elephants
is
no
proof
that
water
is
near
for
these
animals
roam
over
vast
tracts
of
country
and
may
be
met
scores
of
miles
from
it
not
so
however
the
zebra
pallah
buffalo
and
rhinoceros
their
spoor
gives
assurance
that
water
is
not
far
off
as
they
never
stray
any
distance
from
its
neighbourhood
but
when
amidst
the
solemn
stillness
of
the
woods
the
singing
of
joyous
birds
falls
upon
the
ear
it
is
certain
that
water
is
close
at
hand
our
men
in
hunting
came
on
an
immense
herd
of
buffaloes
quietly
resting
in
the
long
dry
grass
and
began
to
blaze
away
furiously
at
the
astonished
animals
in
the
wild
excitement
of
the
hunt
which
heretofore
had
been
conducted
with
spears
some
forgot
to
load
with
ball
and
firing
away
vigorously
with
powder
only
wondered
for
the
moment
that
the
buffaloes
did
not
fall
the
slayer
of
the
young
elephant
having
buried
his
four
bullets
in
as
many
buffaloes
fired
three
charges
of
no
shot
he
had
for
killing
guineafowl
the
quaint
remarks
and
merriment
after
these
little
adventures
seemed
to
the
listener
like
the
pleasant
prattle
of
children
mbia
and
mantlanyane
however
killed
one
buffalo
each
both
the
beasts
were
in
prime
condition
the
meat
was
like
really
excellent
beef
with
a
smack
of
venison
a
troop
of
hungry
howling
hyenas
also
thought
the
savour
tempting
as
they
hung
round
the
camp
at
night
anxious
to
partake
of
the
feast
they
are
fortunately
arrant
cowards
and
never
attack
either
men
or
beasts
except
they
can
catch
them
asleep

or
at
some
other
disadvantage
with
a
bright
fire

excites
no
uneasiness
a
piece
of
meat
hung
on
a
tree
high
enough
to
make
him
jump
to
reach
it
and
a
short
spear
with
its
handle
firmly
planted
in
the
ground
beneath
are
used
as
a
device
to
induce
the
hyena
to
commit
suicide
by
impalement
the
honeyguide
is
an
extraordinary
bird
how
is
it
that
every
member
of
its
family
has
learned
that
all
men
white
or
black
are
fond
of
honey
the
instant
the
little
fellow
gets
a
glimpse
of
a
man
he
hastens
to
greet
him
with
the
hearty
invitation
to
come
as
mbia
translated
it
to
a
bees
hive
and
take
some
honey
he
flies
on
in
the
proper
direction
perches
on
a
tree
and
looks
back
to
see
if
you
are
following
then
on
to
another
and
another
until
he
guides
you
to
the
spot
if
you
do
not
accept
his
first
invitation
he
follows
you
with
pressing
importunities
quite
as
anxious
to
lure
the
stranger
to
the
bees
hive
as
other
birds
are
to
draw
him
away
from
their
own
nest
except
while
on
the
march
our
men
were
sure
to
accept
the
invitation
and
manifested
the
same
by
a
peculiar
responsive
whistle
meaning
as
they
said
all
right
go
ahead
we
are
coming
the
bird
never
deceived
them
but
always
guided
them
to
a
hive
of
bees
though
some
had
but
little
honey
in
store
has
this
peculiar
habit
of
the
honeyguide
its
origin
as
the
attachment
of
dogs
in
friendship
for
man
or
in
love
for
the
sweet
pickings
of
the
plunder
left
on
the
ground
selfinterest
aiding
in
preservation
from
danger
seems
to
be
the
rule
in
most
cases
as
for
instance
in
the
bird
that
guards
the
buffalo
and
rhinoceros
the
grass
is
often
so
tall
and
dense
that
one
could
go
close
up
to
these
animals
quite
unperceived
but
the
guardian
bird
sitting
on
the
beast
sees
the
approach
of
danger
flaps
its
wings
and
screams
which
causes
its
bulky
charge
to
rush
off
from
a
foe
he
has
neither
seen
nor
heard
for
his
reward
the
vigilant
little
watcher
has
the
pick
of
the
parasites
on
his
fat
friend
in
other
cases
a
chance
of
escape
must
be
given
even
by
the
animal
itself
to
its
prey
as
in
the
rattlesnake
which
when
excited
to
strike
cannot
avoid
using
his
rattle
any
more
than
the
cat
can
resist
curling
its
tail
when
excited
in
the
chase
of
a
mouse
or
the
cobra
can
refrain
from
inflating
the
loose
skin
of
the
neck
and
extending
it
laterally
before
striking
its
poison
fangs
into
its
victim
there
are
many
snakes
in
parts
of
this
pass
they
basked
in
the
warm
sunshine
but
rustled
off
through
the
leaves
as
we
approached
we
observed
one
morning
a
small
one
of
a
deadly
poisonous
species
named
kakone
on
a
bush
by
the
wayside
quietly
resting
in
a
horizontal
position
digesting
a
lizard
for
breakfast
though
openly
in
view
its
colours
and
curves
so
closely
resembled
a
small
branch
that
some
failed
to
see
it
even
after
being
asked
if
they
perceived
anything
on
the
bush
here
also
one
of
our
number
had
a
glance
at
another
species
rarely
seen
and
whose
swift
lightninglike
motion
has
given
rise
to
the
native
proverb
that
when
a
man
sees
this
snake
he
will
forthwith
become
a
rich
man
we
slept
near
the
ruined
village
of
the
murdered
chief
mpangwe
a
lovely
spot
with
the
zambesi
in
front
and
extensive
gardens
behind
backed
by
a
semicircle
of
hills
receding
up
to
lofty
mountains
our
path
kept
these
mountains
on
our
right
and
crossed
several
streamlets
which
seemed
to
be
perennial
and
among
others
the
selole
which
apparently
flows
past
the
prominent
peak
chiarapela
these
rivulets
have
often
human
dwellings
on
their
banks
but
the
land
can
scarcely
be
said
to
be
occupied
the
number
of
all
sorts
of
game
increases
wonderfully
every
day
as
a
specimen
of
what
may
be
met
with
where
there
are
no
human
habitations
and
where
no
firearms
have
been
introduced
we
may
mention
what
at
times
has
actually
been
seen
by
us
on
the
morning
of
july
rd
a
herd
of
elephants
passed
within
fifty
yards
of
our
sleepingplace
going
down
to
the
river
along
the
dry
bed
of
a
rivulet
starting
a
few
minutes
before
the
main
body
we
come
upon
large
flocks
of
guineafowl
shoot
what
may
be
wanted
for
dinner
or
next
mornings
breakfast
and
leave
them
in
the
path
to
be
picked
up
by
the
cook
and
his
mates
behind
as
we
proceed
francolins
of
three
varieties
run
across
the
path
and
hundreds
of
turtledoves
rise
with
great
blatter
of
wing
and
fly
off
to
the
trees
guineafowls
francolins
turtledoves
ducks
and
geese
are
the
game
birds
of
this
region
at
sunrise
a
herd
of
pallahs
standing
like
a
flock
of
sheep
allow
the
first
man
of
our
long
indian
file
to
approach
within
about
fifty
yards
but
having
meat
we
let
them
trot
off
leisurely
and
unmolested
soon
afterwards
we
come
upon
a
herd
of
waterbucks
which
here
are
very
much
darker
in
colour
and
drier
in
flesh
than
the
same
species
near
the
sea
they
look
at
us
and
we
at
them
and
we
pass
on
to
see
a
herd
of
doe
koodoos
with
a
magnificently
horned
buck
or
two
hurrying
off
to
the
dry
hillsides
we
have
ceased
shooting
antelopes
as
our
men
have
been
so
often
gorged
with
meat
that
they
have
become
fat
and
dainty
they
say
that
they
do
not
want
more
venison
it
is
so
dry
and
tasteless
and
ask
why
we
do
not
give
them
shot
to
shoot
the
more
savoury
guineafowl
about
eight
oclock
the
tsetse
commence
to
buzz
about
us
and
bite
our
hands
and
necks
sharply
just
as
we
are
thinking
of
breakfast
we
meet
some
buffaloes
grazing
by
the
path
but
they
make
off
in
a
heavy
gallop
at
the
sight
of
man
we
fire
and
the
foremost
badly
wounded
separates
from
the
herd
and
is
seen
to
stop
amongst
the
trees
but
as
it
is
a
matter
of
great
danger
to
follow
a
wounded
buffalo
we
hold
on
our
way
it
is
this
losing
of
wounded
animals
which
makes
firearms
so
annihilating
to
these
beasts
of
the
field
and
will
in
time
sweep
them
all
away
the
small
enfield
bullet
is
worse
than
the
old
round
one
for
this
it
often
goes
through
an
animal
without
killing
him
and
he
afterwards
perishes
when
he
is
of
no
value
to
man
after
breakfast
we
draw
near
a
pond
of
water
a
couple
of
elephants
stand
on
its
bank
and
at
a
respectful
distance
behind
these
monarchs
of
the
wilderness
is
seen
a
herd
of
zebras
and
another
of
waterbucks
on
getting
our
wind
the
royal
beasts
make
off
at
once
but
the
zebras
remain
till
the
foremost
man
is
within
eighty
yards
of
them
when
old
and
young
canter
gracefully
away
the
zebra
has
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
and
this
is
often
fatal
to
him
for
he
has
the
habit
of
stopping
to
look
at
the
hunter
in
this
particular
he
is
the
exact
opposite
of
the
diver
antelope
which
rushes
off
like
the
wind
and
never
for
a
moment
stops
to
look
behind
after
having
once
seen
or
smelt
danger
the
finest
zebra
of
the
herd
is
sometimes
shot
our
men
having
taken
a
sudden
fancy
to
the
flesh
which
all
declare
to
be
the
king
of
good
meat
on
the
plains
of
short
grass
between
us
and
the
river
many
antelopes
of
different
species
are
calmly
grazing
or
reposing
wild
pigs
are
common
and
walk
abroad
during
the
day
but
are
so
shy
as
seldom
to
allow
a
close
approach
on
taking
alarm
they
erect
their
slender
tails
in
the
air
and
trot
off
swiftly
in
a
straight
line
keeping
their
bodies
as
steady
as
a
locomotive
on
a
railroad
a
mile
beyond
the
pool
three
cow
buffaloes
with
their
calves
come
from
the
woods
and
move
out
into
the
plain
a
troop
of
monkeys
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
scamper
back
to
its
depths
on
hearing
the
loud
song
of
singeleka
and
old
surly
fellows
catching
sight
of
the
human
party
insult
it
with
a
loud
and
angry
bark
early
in
the
afternoon
we
may
see
buffaloes
again
or
other
animals
we
camp
on
the
dry
higher
ground
after
as
has
happened
driving
off
a
solitary
elephant
the
nights
are
warmer
now
and
possess
nearly
as
much
of
interest
and
novelty
as
the
days
a
new
world
awakes
and
comes
forth
more
numerous
if
we
may
judge
by
the
noise
it
makes
than
that
which
is
abroad
by
sunlight
lions
and
hyenas
roar
around
us
and
sometimes
come
disagreeably
near
though
they
have
never
ventured
into
our
midst
strange
birds
sing
their
agreeable
songs
while
others
scream
and
call
harshly
as
if
in
fear
or
anger
marvellous
insectsounds
fall
upon
the
ear
one
said
by
natives
to
proceed
from
a
large
beetle
resembles
a
succession
of
measured
musical
blows
upon
an
anvil
while
many
others
are
perfectly
indescribable
a
little
lemur
was
once
seen
to
leap
about
from
branch
to
branch
with
the
agility
of
a
frog
it
chirruped
like
a
bird
and
is
not
larger
than
a
robin
redbreast
reptiles
though
numerous
seldom
troubled
us
only
two
men
suffered
from
stings
and
that
very
slightly
during
the
entire
journey
the
one
supposed
that
he
was
bitten
by
a
snake
and
the
other
was
stung
by
a
scorpion
grassburning
has
begun
and
is
producing
the
blue
hazy
atmosphere
of
the
american
indian
summer
which
in
western
africa
is
called
the
smokes
miles
of
fire
burn
on
the
mountainsides
in
the
evenings
but
go
out
during
the
night
from
their
height
they
resemble
a
broad
zigzag
line
of
fire
in
the
heavens
we
slept
on
the
night
of
the
th
of
july
on
the
left
bank
of
the
chongwe
which
comes
through
a
gap
in
the
hills
on
our
right
and
is
twenty
yards
wide
a
small
tribe
of
the
bazizulu
from
the
south
under
dadanga
have
recently
settled
here
and
built
a
village
some
of
their
houses
are
square
and
they
seem
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
the
bakoa
who
own
the
country
they
like
the
other
natives
cultivate
cotton
but
of
a
different
species
from
any
we
have
yet
seen
in
africa
the
staple
being
very
long
and
the
boll
larger
than
what
is
usually
met
with
the
seeds
cohere
as
in
the
pernambuco
kind
they
brought
the
seed
with
them
from
their
own
country
the
distant
mountains
of
which
in
the
south
still
inhabited
by
their
fellowcountrymen
who
possess
much
cattle
and
use
shields
can
be
seen
from
this
high
ground
these
people
profess
to
be
children
of
the
great
paramount
chief
kwanyakarombe
who
is
said
to
be
lord
of
all
the
bazizulu
the
name
of
this
tribe
is
known
to
geographers
who
derive
their
information
from
the
portuguese
as
the
morusurus
and
the
hills
mentioned
above
are
said
to
have
been
the
country
of
changamira
the
warriorchief
of
history
whom
no
portuguese
ever
dared
to
approach
the
bazizulu
seem
by
report
to
be
brave
mountaineers
nearer
the
river
the
sidima
inhabit
the
plains
just
as
on
the
north
side
the
babimpe
live
on
the
heights
about
two
days
off
and
the
makoa
on
or
near
the
river
the
chief
of
the
bazizulu
we
were
now
with
was
hospitable
and
friendly
a
herd
of
buffaloes
came
trampling
through
the
gardens
and
roused
up
our
men
a
feat
that
roaring
lions
seldom
achieved
our
course
next
day
passed
over
the
upper
terrace
and
through
a
dense
thorn
jungle
travelling
is
always
difficult
where
there
is
no
path
but
it
is
even
more
perplexing
where
the
forest
is
cut
up
by
many
gametracks
here
we
got
separated
from
one
another
and
a
rhinoceros
with
angry
snort
dashed
at
dr
livingstone
as
he
stooped
to
pick
up
a
specimen
of
the
wild
fruit
morula
but
she
strangely
stopped
stockstill
when
less
than
her
own
length
distant
and
gave
him
time
to
escape
a
branch
pulled
out
his
watch
as
he
ran
and
turning
half
round
to
grasp
it
he
got
a
distant
glance
of
her
and
her
calf
still
standing
on
the
selfsame
spot
as
if
arrested
in
the
middle
of
her
charge
by
an
unseen
hand
when
about
fifty
yards
off
thinking
his
companions
close
behind
he
shouted
look
out
there
when
off
she
rushed
snorting
loudly
in
another
direction
the
doctor
usually
went
unarmed
before
this
but
never
afterwards
a
fine
eland
was
shot
by
dr
kirk
this
afternoon
the
first
we
have
killed
it
was
in
firstrate
condition
and
remarkably
fat
but
the
meat
though
so
tempting
in
appearance
severely
deranged
all
who
partook
of
it
heartily
especially
those
who
ate
of
the
fat
natives
who
live
in
game
countries
and
are
acquainted
with
the
different
kinds
of
wild
animals
have
a
prejudice
against
the
fat
of
the
eland
the
pallah
the
zebra
hippopotamus
and
pig
they
never
reject
it
however
the
climate
making
the
desire
for
all
animal
food
very
strong
but
they
consider
that
it
causes
ulcers
and
leprosy
while
the
fat
of
sheep
and
of
oxen
never
produces
any
bad
effects
unless
the
animal
is
diseased
on
the
morning
of
the
th
after
passing
four
villages
we
breakfasted
at
an
old
friends
tombanyama
who
lives
now
on
the
mainland
having
resigned
the
reedy
island
where
he
was
first
seen
to
the
buffaloes
which
used
to
take
his
crops
and
show
fight
to
his
men
he
keeps
a
large
flock
of
tame
pigeons
and
some
fine
fat
capons
one
of
which
he
gave
us
with
a
basket
of
meal
they
have
plenty
of
salt
in
this
part
of
the
country
obtaining
it
from
the
plains
in
the
usual
way
the
halfcaste
partner
of
sequasha
and
a
number
of
his
men
were
staying
near
the
fellow
was
very
munch
frightened
when
he
saw
us
and
trembled
so
much
when
he
spoke
that
the
makololo
and
other
natives
noticed
and
remarked
on
it
his
fears
arose
from
a
sense
of
guilt
as
we
said
nothing
to
frighten
him
and
did
not
allude
to
the
murder
till
a
few
minutes
before
starting
when
it
was
remarked
that
dr
livingstone
having
been
accredited
to
the
murdered
chief
it
would
be
his
duty
to
report
on
it
and
that
not
even
the
portuguese
government
would
approve
of
the
deed
he
defended
it
by
saying
that
they
had
put
in
the
right
man
the
other
was
a
usurper
he
was
evidently
greatly
relieved
when
we
departed
in
the
afternoon
we
came
to
an
outlying
hamlet
of
kambadzo
whose
own
village
is
on
an
island
nyampungo
or
nyangalule
at
the
confluence
of
the
kafue
the
chief
was
on
a
visit
here
and
they
had
been
enjoying
a
regular
jollification
there
had
been
much
mirth
music
drinking
and
dancing
the
men
and
women
too
had
taken
a
wee
drap
too
much
but
had
not
passed
the
complimentary
stage
the
wife
of
the
headman
after
looking
at
us
a
few
moments
called
out
to
the
others
black
traders
have
come
before
calling
themselves
bazungu
or
white
men
but
now
for
the
first
time
have
we
seen
the
real
bazungu
kambadzo
also
soon
appeared
he
was
sorry
that
we
had
not
come
before
the
beer
was
all
done
but
he
was
going
back
to
see
if
it
was
all
really
and
entirely
finished
and
not
one
little
potful
left
somewhere
this
was
of
course
mere
characteristic
politeness
as
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
every
drop
had
been
swallowed
so
we
proceeded
on
to
the
kafue
or
kafuje
accompanied
by
the
most
intelligent
of
his
headmen
a
high
ridge
just
before
we
reached
the
confluence
commands
a
splendid
view
of
the
two
great
rivers
and
the
rich
country
beyond
behind
on
the
north
and
east
is
the
high
mountainrange
along
whose
base
we
have
been
travelling
the
whole
range
is
covered
with
trees
which
appear
even
on
the
prominent
peaks
chiarapela
morindi
and
chiava
at
this
last
the
chain
bends
away
to
the
nw
and
we
could
see
the
distant
mountains
where
the
chief
semalembue
gained
all
our
hearts
in
on
the
th
of
july
we
tried
to
send
semalembue
a
present
but
the
people
here
refused
to
incur
the
responsibility
of
carrying
it
we
who
have
the
art
of
writing
cannot
realize
the
danger
one
incurs
of
being
accused
of
purloining
a
portion
of
goods
sent
from
one
person
to
another
when
the
carrier
cannot
prove
that
he
delivered
all
committed
to
his
charge
rumours
of
a
foray
having
been
made
either
by
makololo
or
batoka
as
far
as
the
fork
of
the
kafue
were
received
here
by
our
men
with
great
indignation
as
it
looked
as
if
the
marauders
were
shutting
up
the
country
which
they
had
been
trying
so
much
to
open
below
the
junction
of
the
rivers
on
a
shallow
sandbank
lay
a
large
herd
of
hippopotami
their
bodies
out
of
the
water
like
masses
of
black
rock
kambadzos
island
called
nyangalule
a
name
which
occurs
again
at
the
mouth
of
the
zambesi
has
many
choice
motsikiri
trachelia
trees
on
it
and
four
very
conspicuous
stately
palms
growing
out
of
a
single
stem
the
kafue
reminds
us
a
little
of
the
shire
flowing
between
steep
banks
with
fertile
land
on
both
sides
it
is
a
smaller
river
and
has
less
current
here
it
seems
to
come
from
the
west
the
headman
of
the
village
near
which
we
encamped
brought
a
present
of
meal
fowls
and
sweet
potatoes
they
have
both
the
red
and
white
varieties
of
this
potato
we
have
on
several
occasions
during
this
journey
felt
the
want
of
vegetables
in
a
disagreeable
craving
which
our
diet
of
meat
and
native
meal
could
not
satisfy
it
became
worse
and
worse
till
we
got
a
meal
of
potatoes
which
allayed
it
at
once
a
great
scarcity
of
vegetables
prevails
in
these
parts
of
africa
the
natives
collect
several
kinds
of
wild
plants
in
the
woods
which
they
use
no
doubt
for
the
purpose
of
driving
off
cravings
similar
to
those
we
experienced
owing
to
the
strength
of
the
wind
and
the
cranky
state
of
the
canoes
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
th
before
our
party
was
ferried
over
the
kafue
after
crossing
we
were
in
the
bawe
country
fishhooks
here
of
native
workmanship
were
observed
to
have
barbs
like
the
european
hooks
elsewhere
the
point
of
the
hook
is
merely
bent
in
towards
the
shank
to
have
the
same
effect
in
keeping
on
the
fish
as
the
barb
we
slept
near
a
village
a
short
distance
above
the
ford
the
people
here
are
of
batoka
origin
the
same
as
many
of
our
men
and
call
themselves
batonga
independents
or
balengi
and
their
language
only
differs
slightly
from
that
of
the
bakoa
who
live
between
the
two
rivers
kafue
and
loangwa
the
paramount
chief
of
the
district
lives
to
the
west
of
this
place
and
is
called
nchomokelaan
hereditary
title
the
family
buryingplace
is
on
a
small
hill
near
this
village
the
women
salute
us
by
clapping
their
hands
and
lullilooing
as
we
enter
and
leave
a
village
and
the
men
as
they
think
respectfully
clap
their
hands
on
their
hips
immense
crops
of
mapira
holcus
sorghum
are
raised
one
species
of
it
forms
a
natural
bend
on
the
seedstalk
so
that
the
massive
ear
hangs
down
the
grain
was
heaped
up
on
wooden
stages
and
so
was
a
variety
of
other
products
the
men
are
skilful
hunters
and
kill
elephants
and
buffaloes
with
long
heavy
spears
we
halted
a
few
minutes
on
the
morning
of
the
th
july
opposite
the
narrow
island
of
sikakoa
which
has
a
village
on
its
lower
end
we
were
here
told
that
moselekatses
chief
town
is
a
months
distance
from
this
place
they
had
heard
moreover
that
the
english
had
come
to
moselekatse
and
told
him
it
was
wrong
to
kill
men
and
he
had
replied
that
he
was
born
to
kill
people
but
would
drop
the
habit
and
since
the
english
came
he
had
sent
out
his
men
not
to
kill
as
of
yore
but
to
collect
tribute
of
cloth
and
ivory
this
report
referred
to
the
arrival
of
the
rev
r
moffat
of
kuruman
who
we
afterwards
found
had
established
a
mission
the
statement
is
interesting
as
showing
that
though
imperfectly
expressed
the
purport
of
the
missionaries
teaching
had
travelled
in
a
short
time
over
miles
and
we
know
not
how
far
the
knowledge
of
the
english
operations
on
the
coast
spread
inland
when
abreast
of
the
high
wooded
island
kalabi
we
came
in
contact
with
one
of
the
gamelaws
of
the
country
which
has
come
down
from
the
most
ancient
times
an
old
buffalo
crossed
the
path
a
few
yards
in
front
of
us
our
guide
threw
his
small
spear
at
its
hip
and
it
was
going
off
scarcely
hurt
when
three
rifle
balls
knocked
it
over
it
is
mine
said
the
guide
he
had
wounded
it
first
and
the
established
native
game
law
is
that
the
animal
belongs
to
the
man
who
first
draws
blood
the
two
legs
on
one
side
by
the
same
law
belonged
to
us
for
killing
it
this
beast
was
very
old
blind
of
one
eye
and
scabby
the
horns
mere
stumps
not
a
foot
long
must
have
atrophied
when
by
age
he
lost
the
strength
distinctive
of
his
sex
some
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
of
horn
could
not
well
be
worn
down
by
mere
rubbing
against
the
trees
we
saw
many
buffaloes
next
day
standing
quietly
amidst
a
thick
thornjungle
through
which
we
were
passing
they
often
stood
until
we
were
within
fifty
or
a
hundred
yards
of
them
on
the
th
july
we
left
the
river
at
the
mountainrange
which
lying
northeast
and
southwest
across
the
river
forms
the
kariba
gorge
near
the
upper
end
of
the
kariba
rapids
the
stream
sanyati
enters
from
the
south
and
is
reported
to
have
moselekatses
principal
cattleposts
at
its
sources
our
route
went
round
the
end
of
the
mountains
and
we
encamped
beside
the
village
of
the
generous
chief
moloi
who
brought
us
three
immense
baskets
of
fine
mapira
meal
ten
fowls
and
two
pots
of
beer
on
receiving
a
present
in
return
he
rose
and
with
a
few
dancing
gestures
said
or
sang
motota
motota
motota
which
our
men
translated
into
thanks
he
had
visited
moselekatse
a
few
months
before
our
arrival
and
saw
the
english
missionaries
living
in
their
wagons
they
told
moselekatse
said
he
they
were
of
his
family
or
friends
and
would
plough
the
land
and
live
at
their
own
expense
and
he
had
replied
the
land
is
before
you
and
i
shall
come
and
see
you
plough
this
again
was
substantially
what
took
place
when
mr
moffat
introduced
the
missionaries
to
his
old
friend
and
shows
still
further
that
the
notion
of
losing
their
country
by
admitting
foreigners
does
not
come
as
the
first
idea
to
the
native
mind
one
might
imagine
that
as
mechanical
powers
are
unknown
to
the
heathen
the
almost
magic
operations
of
machinery
the
discoveries
of
modern
science
and
art
or
the
presence
of
the
prodigious
force
which
for
instance
is
associated
with
the
sight
of
a
manofwar
would
have
the
effect
which
miracles
once
had
of
arresting
the
attention
and
inspiring
awe
but
though
we
have
heard
the
natives
exclaim
in
admiration
at
the
sight
of
even
small
illustrations
of
what
science
enables
us
to
doye
are
gods
and
not
menthe
heart
is
unaffected
in
attempting
their
moral
elevation
it
is
always
more
conducive
to
the
end
desired
that
the
teacher
should
come
unaccompanied
by
any
power
to
cause
either
jealousy
or
fear
the
heathen
who
have
not
become
aware
of
the
greed
and
hate
which
too
often
characterize
the
advancing
tide
of
emigration
listen
with
most
attention
to
the
message
of
divine
love
when
delivered
by
men
who
evidently
possess
the
same
human
sympathies
with
themselves
a
chief
is
rather
envied
his
good
fortune
in
first
securing
foreigners
in
his
town
jealousy
of
strangers
belongs
more
to
the
arab
than
to
the
african
character
and
if
the
women
are
let
alone
by
the
traveller
no
danger
need
be
apprehended
from
any
save
the
slavetrading
tribes
and
not
often
even
from
them
we
passed
through
a
fertile
country
covered
with
open
forest
accompanied
by
the
friendly
bawe
they
are
very
hospitable
many
of
them
were
named
among
themselves
the
baenda
pezi
or
gonakeds
their
only
clothing
being
a
coat
of
red
ochre
occasionally
stopping
at
their
villages
we
were
duly
lullilooed
and
regaled
with
sweet
newmade
beer
which
being
yet
unfermented
was
not
intoxicating
it
is
in
this
state
called
liting
or
makonde
some
of
the
men
carry
large
shields
of
buffalo
hide
and
all
are
well
supplied
with
heavy
spears
the
vicinity
of
the
villages
is
usually
cleared
and
cultivated
in
large
patches
but
nowhere
can
the
country
be
said
to
be
stocked
with
people
at
every
village
stands
were
erected
and
piles
of
the
native
corn
still
unthrashed
placed
upon
them
some
had
been
beaten
out
put
into
oblong
parcels
made
of
grass
and
stacked
in
wooden
frames
we
crossed
several
rivulets
in
our
course
as
the
mandora
the
lofia
the
manzaia
with
brackish
water
the
rimbe
the
chibue
the
chezia
the
chilola
containing
fragments
of
coal
which
did
little
more
than
mark
our
progress
the
island
and
rapid
of
nakansalo
of
which
we
had
formerly
heard
were
of
no
importance
the
rapid
being
but
half
a
mile
long
and
only
on
one
side
of
the
island
the
island
kaluzi
marks
one
of
the
numerous
places
where
astronomical
observations
were
made
mozia
a
station
where
a
volunteer
poet
left
us
the
island
mochenya
and
mpande
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
zungwe
rivulet
where
we
left
the
zambesi
when
favoured
with
the
hospitality
and
company
of
the
gonakeds
we
tried
to
discover
if
nudity
were
the
badge
of
a
particular
order
among
the
bawe
but
they
could
only
refer
to
custom
some
among
them
had
always
liked
it
for
no
reason
in
particular
shame
seemed
to
lie
dormant
and
the
sense
could
not
be
aroused
by
our
laughing
and
joking
them
on
their
appearance
they
evidently
felt
no
less
decent
than
we
did
with
our
clothes
on
but
whatever
may
be
said
in
favour
of
nude
statues
it
struck
us
that
man
in
a
state
of
nature
is
a
most
ungainly
animal
could
we
see
a
number
of
the
degraded
of
our
own
lower
classes
in
like
guise
it
is
probable
that
without
the
black
colour
which
acts
somehow
as
a
dress
they
would
look
worse
still
in
domestic
contentions
the
bawe
are
careful
not
to
kill
each
other
but
when
one
village
goes
to
war
with
another
they
are
not
so
particular
the
victorious
party
are
said
to
quarter
one
of
the
bodies
of
the
enemies
they
may
have
killed
and
to
perform
certain
ceremonies
over
the
fragments
the
vanquished
call
upon
their
conquerors
to
give
them
a
portion
also
and
when
this
request
is
complied
with
they
too
perform
the
same
ceremonies
and
lament
over
their
dead
comrade
after
which
the
late
combatants
may
visit
each
other
in
peace
sometimes
the
head
of
the
slain
is
taken
and
buried
in
an
anthill
till
all
the
flesh
is
gone
and
the
lower
jaw
is
then
worn
as
a
trophy
by
the
slayer
but
this
we
never
saw
and
the
foregoing
information
was
obtained
only
through
an
interpreter
we
left
the
zambesi
at
the
mouth
of
the
zungwe
or
mozama
or
dela
rivulet
up
which
we
proceeded
first
in
a
westerly
and
then
in
a
northwesterly
direction
the
zungwe
at
this
time
had
no
water
in
its
sandy
channel
for
the
first
eight
or
ten
miles
willows
however
grow
on
the
banks
and
water
soon
began
to
appear
in
the
hollows
and
a
few
miles
further
up
it
was
a
fine
flowing
stream
deliciously
cold
as
in
many
other
streams
from
chicova
to
near
sinamane
shale
and
coal
crop
out
in
the
bank
and
here
the
large
roots
of
stigmaria
or
its
allied
plants
were
found
we
followed
the
course
of
the
zungwe
to
the
foot
of
the
batoka
highlands
up
whose
steep
and
rugged
sides
of
red
and
white
quartz
we
climbed
till
we
attained
an
altitude
of
upwards
of
feet
here
on
the
cool
and
bracing
heights
the
exhilaration
of
mind
and
body
was
delightful
as
we
looked
back
at
the
hollow
beneath
covered
with
a
hot
sultry
glare
not
unpleasant
now
that
we
were
in
the
mild
radiance
above
we
had
a
noble
view
of
the
great
valley
in
which
the
zambesi
flows
the
cultivated
portions
are
so
small
in
comparison
to
the
rest
of
the
landscape
that
the
valley
appears
nearly
all
forest
with
a
few
grassy
glades
we
spent
the
night
of
the
th
july
high
above
the
level
of
the
sea
by
the
rivulet
tyotyo
near
tabacheu
or
chirebuechina
names
both
signifying
white
mountain
in
the
morning
hoar
frost
covered
the
ground
and
thin
ice
was
on
the
pools
skirting
the
southern
flank
of
tabacheu
we
soon
passed
from
the
hills
on
to
the
portion
of
the
vast
tableland
called
mataba
and
looking
back
saw
all
the
way
across
the
zambesi
valley
to
the
lofty
ridge
some
thirty
miles
off
which
coming
from
the
mashona
a
country
in
the
se
runs
to
the
nw
to
join
the
ridge
at
the
angle
of
which
are
the
victoria
falls
and
then
bends
far
to
the
ne
from
the
same
point
only
a
few
years
since
these
extensive
highlands
were
peopled
by
the
batoka
numerous
herds
of
cattle
furnished
abundance
of
milk
and
the
rich
soil
amply
repaid
the
labour
of
the
husbandman
now
large
herds
of
buffaloes
zebras
and
antelopes
fatten
on
the
excellent
pasture
and
on
that
land
which
formerly
supported
multitudes
not
a
man
is
to
been
seen
in
travelling
from
monday
morning
till
late
on
saturday
afternoon
all
the
way
from
tabacheu
to
moachemba
which
is
only
twentyone
miles
of
latitude
from
the
victoria
falls
and
constantly
passing
the
ruined
sites
of
utterly
deserted
botoka
villages
we
did
not
fall
in
with
a
single
person
the
batoka
were
driven
out
of
their
noble
country
by
the
invasions
of
moselekatse
and
sebetuane
several
tribes
of
bechuana
and
basutu
fleeing
from
the
zulu
or
matebele
chief
moselekatse
reached
the
zambesi
above
the
falls
coming
from
a
land
without
rivers
none
of
them
knew
how
to
swim
and
one
tribe
called
the
bamangwato
wishing
to
cross
the
zambesi
was
ferried
over
men
and
women
separately
to
different
islands
by
one
of
the
batoka
chiefs
the
men
were
then
left
to
starve
and
the
women
appropriated
by
the
ferryman
and
his
people
sekomi
the
present
chief
of
the
bamangwato
then
an
infant
in
his
mothers
arms
was
enabled
through
the
kindness
of
a
private
batoka
to
escape
this
act
seems
to
have
made
an
indelible
impression
on
sekomis
heart
for
though
otherwise
callous
he
still
never
fails
to
inquire
after
the
welfare
of
his
benefactor
sebetuane
with
his
wonted
ability
outwitted
the
treacherous
batoka
by
insisting
in
the
politest
manner
on
their
chief
remaining
at
his
own
side
until
the
people
and
cattle
were
all
carried
safe
across
the
chief
was
then
handsomely
rewarded
both
with
cattle
and
brass
rings
off
sebetuanes
own
wives
no
sooner
were
the
makololo
then
called
basuto
safely
over
than
they
were
confronted
by
the
whole
batoka
nation
and
to
this
day
the
makololo
point
with
pride
to
the
spot
on
the
lekone
near
to
which
they
were
encamped
where
sebetuane
with
a
mere
handful
of
warriors
in
comparison
to
the
vast
horde
that
surrounded
him
stood
waiting
the
onslaught
the
warriors
in
one
small
body
the
women
and
children
guarding
the
cattle
behind
them
the
batoka
of
course
melted
away
before
those
who
had
been
made
veterans
by
years
of
continual
fighting
and
sebetuane
always
justified
his
subsequent
conquests
in
that
country
by
alleging
that
the
batoka
had
come
out
to
fight
with
a
man
fleeing
for
his
life
who
had
never
done
them
any
wrong
they
seem
never
to
have
been
a
warlike
race
passing
through
their
country
we
once
observed
a
large
stone
cairn
and
our
guide
favoured
us
with
the
following
account
of
itonce
upon
a
time
our
forefathers
were
going
to
fight
another
tribe
and
here
they
halted
and
sat
down
after
a
long
consultation
they
came
to
the
unanimous
conclusion
that
instead
of
proceeding
to
fight
and
kill
their
neighbours
and
perhaps
be
killed
themselves
it
would
be
more
like
men
to
raise
this
heap
of
stones
as
their
protest
against
the
wrong
the
other
tribe
had
done
them
which
having
accomplished
they
returned
quietly
home
such
men
of
peace
could
not
stand
before
the
makololo
nor
of
course
the
more
warlike
matebele
who
coming
afterwards
drove
even
their
conquerors
the
makololo
out
of
the
country
sebetuane
however
profiting
by
the
tactics
which
he
had
learned
of
the
batoka
inveigled
a
large
body
of
this
new
enemy
on
to
another
island
and
after
due
starvation
there
overcame
the
whole
a
much
greater
army
of
moselekatses
own
followed
with
canoes
but
were
now
baffled
by
sebetuanes
placing
all
his
people
and
cattle
on
an
island
and
so
guarding
it
that
none
could
approach
dispirited
famished
borne
down
by
fever
they
returned
to
the
falls
and
all
except
five
were
cut
off
but
though
the
batoka
appear
never
to
have
had
much
inclination
to
fight
with
men
they
are
decidedly
brave
hunters
of
buffaloes
and
elephants
they
go
fearlessly
close
up
to
these
formidable
animals
and
kill
them
with
large
spears
the
banyai
who
have
long
bullied
all
portuguese
traders
were
amazed
at
the
daring
and
bravery
of
the
batoka
in
coming
at
once
to
close
quarters
with
the
elephant
and
chisaka
a
portuguese
rebel
having
formerly
induced
a
body
of
this
tribe
to
settle
with
him
ravaged
all
the
portuguese
villas
around
tette
they
bear
the
name
of
basimilongwe
and
some
of
our
men
found
relations
among
them
sininyane
and
matenga
also
two
of
our
party
were
once
inveigled
into
a
portuguese
expedition
against
mariano
by
the
assertion
that
the
doctor
had
arrived
and
had
sent
for
them
to
come
down
to
senna
on
finding
that
they
were
entrapped
to
fight
they
left
after
seeing
an
officer
with
a
large
number
of
tette
slaves
killed
the
batoka
had
attained
somewhat
civilized
ideas
in
planting
and
protecting
various
fruit
and
oilseed
yielding
trees
of
the
country
no
other
tribe
either
plants
or
abstains
from
cutting
down
fruit
trees
but
here
we
saw
some
which
had
been
planted
in
regular
rows
and
the
trunks
of
which
were
quite
two
feet
in
diameter
the
grand
old
mosibe
a
tree
yielding
a
bean
with
a
thin
red
pellicle
said
to
be
very
fattening
had
probably
seen
two
hundred
summers
dr
kirk
found
that
the
mosibe
is
peculiar
in
being
allied
to
a
species
met
with
only
in
the
west
indies
the
motsikiri
sometimes
called
mafuta
yields
a
hard
fat
and
an
oil
which
is
exported
from
inhambane
it
is
said
that
two
ancient
batoka
travellers
went
down
as
far
as
the
loangwa
and
finding
the
macaa
tree
jujube
or
zisyphus
in
fruit
carried
the
seed
all
the
way
back
to
the
great
falls
in
order
to
plant
them
two
of
these
trees
are
still
to
be
seen
there
the
only
specimens
of
the
kind
in
that
region
the
batoka
had
made
a
near
approach
to
the
custom
of
more
refined
nations
and
had
permanent
graveyards
either
on
the
sides
of
hills
thus
rendered
sacred
or
under
large
old
shady
trees
they
reverence
the
tombs
of
their
ancestors
and
plant
the
largest
elephants
tusks
as
monuments
at
the
head
of
the
grave
or
entirely
enclose
it
with
the
choicest
ivory
some
of
the
other
tribes
throw
the
dead
body
into
the
river
to
be
devoured
by
crocodiles
or
sewing
it
up
in
a
mat
place
it
on
the
branch
of
a
baobab
or
cast
it
in
some
lonely
gloomy
spot
surrounded
by
dense
tropical
vegetation
where
it
affords
a
meal
to
the
foul
hyenas
but
the
batoka
reverently
bury
their
dead
and
regard
the
spot
henceforth
as
sacred
the
ordeal
by
the
poison
of
the
muave
is
resorted
to
by
the
batoka
as
well
as
by
the
other
tribes
but
a
cock
is
often
made
to
stand
proxy
for
the
supposed
witch
near
the
confluence
of
the
kafue
the
mambo
or
chief
with
some
of
his
headmen
came
to
our
sleepingplace
with
a
present
their
foreheads
were
smeared
with
white
flour
and
an
unusual
seriousness
marked
their
demeanour
shortly
before
our
arrival
they
had
been
accused
of
witchcraft
conscious
of
innocence
they
accepted
the
ordeal
and
undertook
to
drink
the
poisoned
muave
for
this
purpose
they
made
a
journey
to
the
sacred
hill
of
nchomokela
on
which
repose
the
bodies
of
their
ancestors
and
after
a
solemn
appeal
to
the
unseen
spirits
to
attest
the
innocence
of
their
children
they
swallowed
the
muave
vomited
and
were
therefore
declared
not
guilty
it
is
evident
that
they
believe
that
the
soul
has
a
continued
existence
and
that
the
spirits
of
the
departed
know
what
those
they
have
left
behind
them
are
doing
and
are
pleased
or
not
according
as
their
deeds
are
good
or
evil
this
belief
is
universal
the
owner
of
a
large
canoe
refused
to
sell
it
because
it
belonged
to
the
spirit
of
his
father
who
helped
him
when
he
killed
the
hippopotamus
another
when
the
bargain
for
his
canoe
was
nearly
completed
seeing
a
large
serpent
on
a
branch
of
the
tree
overhead
refused
to
complete
the
sale
alleging
that
this
was
the
spirit
of
his
father
come
to
protest
against
it
some
of
the
batoka
chiefs
must
have
been
men
of
considerable
enterprise
the
land
of
one
in
the
western
part
of
this
country
was
protected
by
the
zambesi
on
the
s
and
on
the
n
and
e
lay
an
impassable
reedy
marsh
filled
with
water
all
the
year
round
leaving
only
his
western
border
open
to
invasion
he
conceived
the
idea
of
digging
a
broad
and
deep
canal
nearly
a
mile
in
length
from
the
reedy
marsh
to
the
zambesi
and
having
actually
carried
the
scheme
into
execution
he
formed
a
large
island
on
which
his
cattle
grazed
in
safety
and
his
corn
ripened
from
year
to
year
secure
from
all
marauders
another
chief
who
died
a
number
of
years
ago
believed
that
he
had
discovered
a
remedy
for
tsetsebitten
cattle
his
son
moyara
showed
us
a
plant
which
was
new
to
our
botanist
and
likewise
told
us
how
the
medicine
was
prepared
the
bark
of
the
root
and
what
might
please
our
homoeopathic
friends
a
dozen
of
the
tsetse
are
dried
and
ground
together
into
a
fine
powder
this
mixture
is
administered
internally
and
the
cattle
are
fumigated
by
burning
under
them
the
rest
of
the
plant
collected
the
treatment
must
be
continued
for
weeks
whenever
the
symptoms
of
poison
appear
this
medicine
he
frankly
admitted
would
not
cure
all
the
bitten
cattle
for
said
he
cattle
and
men
too
die
in
spite
of
medicine
but
should
a
herd
by
accident
stray
into
a
tsetse
district
and
be
bitten
by
this
medicine
of
my
father
kampakampa
some
of
them
could
be
saved
while
without
it
all
would
inevitably
die
he
stipulated
that
we
were
not
to
show
the
medicine
to
other
people
and
if
ever
we
needed
it
in
this
region
we
must
employ
him
but
if
we
were
far
off
we
might
make
it
ourselves
and
when
we
saw
it
cure
the
cattle
think
of
him
and
send
him
a
present
our
men
made
it
known
everywhere
that
we
wished
the
tribes
to
live
in
peace
and
would
use
our
influence
to
induce
sekeletu
to
prevent
the
batoka
of
moshobotwane
and
the
makololo
underchiefs
making
forays
into
their
country
they
had
already
suffered
severely
and
their
remonstrances
with
their
countryman
moshobotwane
evoked
only
the
answer
the
makololo
have
given
me
a
spear
why
should
i
not
use
it
he
indeed
it
was
who
being
remarkably
swift
of
foot
first
guided
the
makololo
in
their
conquest
of
the
country
in
the
character
of
peacemakers
therefore
we
experienced
abundant
hospitality
and
from
the
kafue
to
the
falls
none
of
our
party
was
allowed
to
suffer
hunger
the
natives
sent
to
our
sleepingplaces
generous
presents
of
the
finest
white
meal
and
fat
capons
to
give
it
a
relish
great
pots
of
beer
to
comfort
our
hearts
together
with
pumpkins
beans
and
tobacco
so
that
we
should
sleep
neither
hungry
nor
thirsty
in
travelling
from
the
kafue
to
the
zungwe
we
frequently
passed
several
villages
in
the
course
of
a
days
march
in
the
evening
came
deputies
from
the
villages
at
which
we
could
not
stay
to
sleep
with
liberal
presents
of
food
it
would
have
pained
them
to
have
allowed
strangers
to
pass
without
partaking
of
their
hospitality
repeatedly
were
we
hailed
from
huts
and
asked
to
wait
a
moment
and
drink
a
little
of
the
beer
which
was
brought
with
alacrity
our
march
resembled
a
triumphant
procession
we
entered
and
left
every
village
amidst
the
cheers
of
its
inhabitants
the
men
clapping
their
hands
and
the
women
lullilooing
with
the
shrill
call
let
us
sleep
or
peace
passing
through
a
hamlet
one
day
our
guide
called
to
the
people
why
do
you
not
clap
your
hands
and
salute
when
you
see
men
who
are
wishing
to
bring
peace
to
the
land
when
we
halted
for
the
night
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
the
people
to
prepare
our
camp
entirely
of
their
own
accord
some
with
hoes
quickly
smoothed
the
ground
for
our
beds
others
brought
dried
grass
and
spread
it
carefully
over
the
spot
some
with
their
small
axes
speedily
made
a
bush
fence
to
shield
us
from
the
wind
and
if
as
occasionally
happened
the
water
was
a
little
distance
off
others
hastened
and
brought
it
with
firewood
to
cook
our
food
with
they
are
an
industrious
people
and
very
fond
of
agriculture
for
hours
together
we
marched
through
unbroken
fields
of
mapira
or
native
corn
of
a
great
width
but
one
can
give
no
idea
of
the
extent
of
land
under
the
hoe
as
compared
with
any
european
country
the
extent
of
surface
is
so
great
that
the
largest
fields
under
culture
when
viewed
on
a
wide
landscape
dwindle
to
mere
spots
when
taken
in
connection
with
the
wants
of
the
people
the
cultivation
on
the
whole
is
most
creditable
to
their
industry
they
erect
numerous
granaries
which
give
their
villages
the
appearance
of
being
large
and
when
the
water
of
the
zambesi
has
subsided
they
place
large
quantities
of
grain
tied
up
in
bundles
of
grass
and
well
plastered
over
with
clay
on
low
sand
islands
for
protection
from
the
attacks
of
marauding
mice
and
men
owing
to
the
ravages
of
the
weevil
the
native
corn
can
hardly
be
preserved
until
the
following
crop
comes
in
however
largely
they
may
cultivate
and
however
abundant
the
harvest
it
must
all
be
consumed
in
a
year
this
may
account
for
their
making
so
much
of
it
into
beer
the
beer
these
batoka
or
bawe
brew
is
not
the
sour
and
intoxicating
boala
or
pombe
found
among
some
other
tribes
but
sweet
and
highly
nutritive
with
only
a
slight
degree
of
acidity
sufficient
to
render
it
a
pleasant
drink
the
people
were
all
plump
and
in
good
condition
and
we
never
saw
a
single
case
of
intoxication
among
them
though
all
drank
abundance
of
this
liting
or
sweet
beer
both
men
and
boys
were
eager
to
work
for
very
small
pay
our
men
could
hire
any
number
of
them
to
carry
their
burdens
for
a
few
beads
a
day
our
miserly
and
dirty
excook
had
an
old
pair
of
trousers
that
some
one
had
given
to
him
after
he
had
long
worn
them
himself
with
one
of
the
sorely
decayed
legs
he
hired
a
man
to
carry
his
heavy
load
a
whole
day
a
second
man
carried
it
the
next
day
for
the
other
leg
and
what
remained
of
the
old
garment
without
the
buttons
procured
the
labour
of
another
man
for
the
third
day
men
of
remarkable
ability
have
risen
up
among
the
africans
from
time
to
time
as
amongst
other
portions
of
the
human
family
some
have
attracted
the
attention
and
excited
the
admiration
of
large
districts
by
their
wisdom
others
apparently
by
the
powers
of
ventriloquism
or
by
peculiar
dexterity
in
throwing
the
spear
or
shooting
with
the
bow
have
been
the
wonder
of
their
generation
but
the
total
absence
of
literature
leads
to
the
loss
of
all
former
experience
and
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
has
not
been
handed
down
they
have
had
their
minstrels
too
but
mere
tradition
preserves
not
their
effusions
one
of
these
and
apparently
a
genuine
poet
attached
himself
to
our
party
for
several
days
and
whenever
we
halted
sang
our
praises
to
the
villagers
in
smooth
and
harmonious
numbers
it
was
a
sort
of
blank
verse
and
each
line
consisted
of
five
syllables
the
song
was
short
when
it
first
began
but
each
day
he
picked
up
more
information
about
us
and
added
to
the
poem
until
our
praises
became
an
ode
of
respectable
length
when
distance
from
home
compelled
his
return
he
expressed
his
regret
at
leaving
us
and
was
of
course
paid
for
his
useful
and
pleasant
flatteries
another
though
a
less
gifted
son
of
song
belonged
to
the
batoka
of
our
own
party
every
evening
while
the
others
were
cooking
talking
or
sleeping
he
rehearsed
his
songs
containing
a
history
of
everything
he
had
seen
in
the
land
of
the
white
men
and
on
the
way
back
in
composing
extempore
any
new
piece
he
was
never
at
a
loss
for
if
the
right
word
did
not
come
he
halted
not
but
eked
out
the
measure
with
a
peculiar
musical
sound
meaning
nothing
at
all
he
accompanied
his
recitations
on
the
sansa
an
instrument
figured
in
the
woodcut
the
nine
iron
keys
of
which
are
played
with
the

the

end

musical

if
too
poor
to
buy

may
be

vigorously
on
an
instrument
made
with
a
number
of
thick
cornstalks
sewn
together
as
a
sansa
frame
and
keys
of
split
bamboo
which
though
making
but
little
sound
seems
to
soothe
the
player
himself
when
the
instrument
is
played
with
a
calabash
as
a

board
it
emits
a
greater
volume
of

pieces
of

are
added
to
make

accompaniment

the
calabash

the
time
we
remained
at
motunta
a
splendid
meteor
was
observed
to
lighten
the
whole
heavens
the
observers
back
was
turned
to
it
but
on
looking
round
the
streak
of
light
was
seen
to
remain
on
its
path
some
seconds
this
streak
is
usually
explained
to
be
only
the
continuance
of
the
impression
made
by
the
shining
body
on
the
retina
this
cannot
be
as
in
this
case
the
meteor
was
not
actually
seen
and
yet
the
streak
was
clearly
perceived
the
rays
of
planets
and
stars
also
require
another
explanation
than
that
usually
given
fruittrees
and
gigantic
wild
figtrees
and
circles
of
stones
on
which
corn
safes
were
placed
with
worn
grindstones
point
out
where
the
villages
once
stood
the
only
reason
now
assigned
for
this
fine
country
remaining
desolate
is
the
fear
of
fresh
visitations
by
the
matebele
the
country
now
slopes
gradually
to
the
west
into
the
makololo
valley
two
days
march
from
the
batoka
village
nearest
the
highlands
we
met
with
some
hunters
who
were
burning
the
dry
grass
in
order
to
attract
the
game
by
the
fresh
vegetation
which
speedily
springs
up
afterwards
the
grass
as
already
remarked
is
excellent
for
cattle
one
species
with
leaves
having
finely
serrated
edges
and
of
a
reddishbrown
colour
we
noticed
our
men
eating
it
tastes
exactly
like
liquoriceroot
and
is
named
kezu
kezu
the
tsetse
known
to
the
batoka
by
the
name
ndoka
does
not
exist
here
though
buffaloes
and
elephants
abound
a
small
trap
in
the
path
baited
with
a
mouse
to
catch
spotted
cats
f
genetta
is
usually
the
first
indication
that
we
are
drawing
near
to
a
village
but
when
we
get
within
the
sounds
of
pounding
corn
cockcrowing
or
the
merry
shouts
of
children
at
play
we
know
that
the
huts
are
but
a
few
yards
off
though
the
trees
conceal
them
from
view
we
reached
on
the
th
of
august
moachemba
the
first
of
the
batoka
villages
which
now
owe
allegiance
to
sekeletu
and
could
see
distinctly
with
the
naked
eye
in
the
great
valley
spread
out
before
us
the
columns
of
vapour
rising
from
the
victoria
falls
though
upwards
of
miles
distant
we
were
informed
that
the
rains
having
failed
this
year
the
corn
crops
had
been
lost
and
great
scarcity
and
much
hunger
prevailed
from
sesheke
to
linyanti
some
of
the
reports
which
the
men
had
heard
from
the
batoka
of
the
hills
concerning
their
families
were
here
confirmed
takelangs
wife
had
been
killed
by
mashotlane
the
headman
at
the
falls
on
a
charge
as
usual
of
witchcraft
inchikolas
two
wives
believing
him
to
be
dead
had
married
again
and
masakasa
was
intensely
disgusted
to
hear
that
two
years
ago
his
friends
upon
a
report
of
his
death
threw
his
shield
over
the
falls
slaughtered
all
his
oxen
and
held
a
species
of
wild
irish
wake
in
honour
of
his
memory
he
said
he
meant
to
disown
them
and
to
say
when
they
come
to
salute
him
i
am
dead
i
am
not
here
i
belong
to
another
world
and
should
stink
if
i
came
among
you
all
the
sad
news
we
had
previously
heard
of
the
disastrous
results
which
followed
the
attempt
of
a
party
of
missionaries
under
the
rev
h
helmore
to
plant
the
gospel
at
linyanti
were
here
fully
confirmed
several
of
the
missionaries
and
their
native
attendants
from
kuruman
had
succumbed
to
the
fever
and
the
survivors
had
retired
some
weeks
before
our
arrival
we
remained
the
whole
of
the
th
beside
the
village
of
the
old
batoka
chief
moshobotwane
the
stoutest
man
we
have
seen
in
africa
the
cause
of
our
delay
here
was
a
severe
attack
of
fever
in
charles
livingstone
he
took
a
dose
of
our
fever
pills
was
better
on
the
th
and
marched
three
hours
then
on
the
th
marched
eight
miles
to
the
great
falls
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
the
fatiguing
exercise
of
sightseeing
we
were
in
the
very
same
valley
as
linyanti
and
this
was
the
same
fever
which
treated
or
rather
maltreated
with
only
a
little
dovers
powder
proved
so
fatal
to
poor
helmore
the
symptoms
too
were
identical
with
those
afterwards
described
by
nonmedical
persons
as
those
of
poison
we
gave
moshobotwane
a
present
and
a
pretty
plain
exposition
of
what
we
thought
of
his
bloody
forays
among
his
batoka
brethren
a
scolding
does
most
good
to
the
recipient
when
put
alongside
some
obliging
act
he
certainly
did
not
take
it
ill
as
was
evident
from
what
he
gave
us
in
return
which
consisted
of
a
liberal
supply
of
meal
milk
and
an
ox
he
has
a
large
herd
of
cattle
and
a
tract
of
fine
pastureland
on
the
beautiful
stream
lekone
a
homefeeling
comes
over
one
even
in
the
interior
of
africa
at
seeing
once
more
cattle
grazing
peacefully
in
the
meadows
the
tsetse
inhabits
the
trees
which
bound
the
pastureland
on
the
west
so
should
the
herdsman
forget
his
duty
the
cattle
straying
might
be
entirely
lost
the
women
of
this
village
were
more
numerous
than
the
men
the
result
of
the
chiefs
marauding
the
batoko
wife
of
sima
came
up
from
the
falls
to
welcome
her
husband
back
bringing
a
present
of
the
best
fruits
of
the
country
her
husband
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
had
brought
a
wife
from
tette
namely
the
girl
whom
he
obtained
from
chisaka
for
his
feats
of
dancing
according
to
our
ideas
his
first
wife
could
hardly
have
been
pleased
at
seeing
the
second
and
younger
one
but
she
took
her
away
home
with
her
while
the
husband
remained
with
us
in
going
down
to
the
fall
village
we
met
several
of
the
real
makololo
they
are
lighter
in
colour
than
the
other
tribes
being
of
a
rich
warm
brown
and
they
speak
in
a
slow
deliberate
manner
distinctly
pronouncing
every
word
on
reaching
the
village
opposite
kalai
we
had
an
interview
with
the
makololo
headman
mashotlane
he
came
to
the
shed
in
which
we
were
seated
a
little
boy
carrying
his
low
three
legged
stool
before
him
on
this
he
sat
down
with
becoming
dignity
looked
round
him
for
a
few
seconds
then
at
us
and
saluting
us
with
rumela
good
morning
or
hail
he
gave
us
some
boiled
hippopotamus
meat
took
a
piece
himself
and
then
handed
the
rest
to
his
attendants
who
soon
ate
it
up
he
defended
his
forays
on
the
ground
that
when
he
went
to
collect
tribute
the
batoka
attacked
him
and
killed
some
of
his
attendants
the
excuses
made
for
their
little
wars
are
often
the
very
same
as
those
made
by
caesar
in
his
commentaries
few
admit
like
old
moshobotwane
that
they
fought
because
they
had
the
power
and
a
fair
prospect
of
conquering
we
found
here
pitsane
who
had
accompanied
the
doctor
to
st
paul
de
loanda
he
had
been
sent
by
sekeletu
to
purchase
three
horses
from
a
trading
party
of
griquas
from
kuruman
who
charged
nine
large
tusks
apiece
for
very
wretched
animals
in
the
evening
when
all
was
still
one
of
our
men
takelang
fired
his
musket
and
cried
out
i
am
weeping
for
my
wife
my
court
is
desolate
i
have
no
home
and
then
uttered
a
loud
wail
of
anguish
we
proceeded
next
morning
th
august
to
see
the
victoria
falls
mosioatunya
is
the
makololo
name
and
means
smoke
sounding
seongo
or
chongwe
meaning
the
rainbow
or
the
place
of
the
rainbow
was
the
more
ancient
term
they
bore
we
embarked
in
canoes
belonging
to
tuba
mokoro
smasher
of
canoes
an
ominous
name
but
he
alone
it
seems
knew
the
medicine
which
insures
one
against
shipwreck
in
the
rapids
above
the
falls
for
some
miles
the
river
was
smooth
and
tranquil
and
we
glided
pleasantly
over
water
clear
as
crystal
and
past
lovely
islands
densely
covered
with
a
tropical
vegetation
noticeable
among
the
many
trees
were
the
lofty
hyphaene
and
borassus
palms
the
graceful
wild
datepalm
with
its
fruit
in
golden
clusters
and
the
umbrageous
mokononga
of
cypress
form
with
its
darkgreen
leaves
and
scarlet
fruit
many
flowers
peeped
out
near
the
waters
edge
some
entirely
new
to
us
and
others
as
the
convolvulus
old
acquaintances
but
our
attention
was
quickly
called
from
the
charming
islands
to
the
dangerous
rapids
down
which
tuba
might
unintentionally
shoot
us
to
confess
the
truth
the
very
ugly
aspect
of
these
roaring
rapids
could
scarcely
fail
to
cause
some
uneasiness
in
the
minds
of
newcomers
it
is
only
when
the
river
is
very
low
as
it
was
now
that
any
one
durst
venture
to
the
island
to
which
we
were
bound
if
one
went
during
the
period
of
flood
and
fortunately
hit
the
island
he
would
be
obliged
to
remain
there
till
the
water
subsided
again
if
he
lived
so
long
both
hippopotami
and
elephants
have
been
known
to
be
swept
over
the
falls
and
of
course
smashed
to
pulp
before
entering
the
race
of
waters
we
were
requested
not
to
speak
as
our
talking
might
diminish
the
virtue
of
the
medicine
and
no
one
with
such
boiling
eddying
rapids
before
his
eyes
would
think
of
disobeying
the
orders
of
a
canoesmasher
it
soon
became
evident
that
there
was
sound
sense
in
this
request
of
tubas
although
the
reason
assigned
was
not
unlike
that
of
the
canoeman
from
sesheke
who
begged
one
of
our
party
not
to
whistle
because
whistling
made
the
wind
come
it
was
the
duty
of
the
man
at
the
bow
to
look
out
ahead
for
the
proper
course
and
when
he
saw
a
rock
or
snag
to
call
out
to
the
steersman
tuba
doubtless
thought
that
talking
on
board
might
divert
the
attention
of
his
steersman
at
a
time
when
the
neglect
of
an
order
or
a
slight
mistake
would
be
sure
to
spill
us
all
into
the
chafing
river
there
were
places
where
the
utmost
exertions
of
both
men
had
to
be
put
forth
in
order
to
force
the
canoe
to
the
only
safe
part
of
the
rapid
and
to
prevent
it
from
sweeping
down
broadside
on
where
in
a
twinkling
we
should
have
found
ourselves
floundering
among
the
plotuses
and
cormorants
which
were
engaged
in
diving
for
their
breakfast
of
small
fish
at
times
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
save
us
from
dashing
in
our
headlong
race
against
the
rocks
which
now
that
the
river
was
low
jutted
out
of
the
water
but
just
at
the
very
nick
of
time
tuba
passed
the
word
to
the
steersman
and
then
with
ready
pole
turned
the
canoe
a
little
aside
and
we
glided
swiftly
past
the
threatened
danger
never
was
canoe
more
admirably
managed
once
only
did
the
medicine
seem
to
have
lost
something
of
its
efficacy
we
were
driving
swiftly
down
a
black
rock
over
which
the
white
foam
flew
lay
directly
in
our
path
the
pole
was
planted
against
it
as
readily
as
ever
but
it
slipped
just
as
tuba
put
forth
his
strength
to
turn
the
bow
off
we
struck
hard
and
were
halffull
of
water
in
a
moment
tuba
recovered
himself
as
speedily
shoved
off
the
bow
and
shot
the
canoe
into
a
still
shallow
place
to
bale
out
the
water
here
we
were
given
to
understand
that
it
was
not
the
medicine
which
was
at
fault
that
had
lost
none
of
its
virtue
the
accident
was
owing
entirely
to
tuba
having
started
without
his
breakfast
need
it
be
said
we
never
let
tuba
go
without
that
meal
again
we
landed
at
the
head
of
garden
island
which
is
situated
near
the
middle
of
the
river
and
on
the
lip
of
the
falls
on
reaching
that
lip
and
peering
over
the
giddy
height
the
wondrous
and
unique
character
of
the
magnificent
cascade
at
once
burst
upon
us
it
is
rather
a
hopeless
task
to
endeavour
to
convey
an
idea
of
it
in
words
since
as
was
remarked
on
the
spot
an
accomplished
painter
even
by
a
number
of
views
could
but
impart
a
faint
impression
of
the
glorious
scene
the
probable
mode
of
its
formation
may
perhaps
help
to
the
conception
of
its
peculiar
shape
niagara
has
been
formed
by
a
wearing
back
of
the
rock
over
which
the
river
falls
and
during
a
long
course
of
ages
it
has
gradually
receded
and
left
a
broad
deep
and
pretty
straight
trough
in
front
it
goes
on
wearing
back
daily
and
may
yet
discharge
the
lakes
from
which
its
riverthe
st
lawrenceflows
but
the
victoria
falls
have
been
formed
by
a
crack
right
across
the
river
in
the
hard
black
basaltic
rock
which
there
formed
the
bed
of
the
zambesi
the
lips
of
the
crack
are
still
quite
sharp
save
about
three
feet
of
the
edge
over
which
the
river
rolls
the
walls
go
sheer
down
from
the
lips
without
any
projecting
crag
or
symptoms
of
stratification
or
dislocation
when
the
mighty
rift
occurred
no
change
of
level
took
place
in
the
two
parts
of
the
bed
of
the
river
thus
rent
asunder
consequently
in
coming
down
the
river
to
garden
island
the
water
suddenly
disappears
and
we
see
the
opposite
side
of
the
cleft
with
grass
and
trees
growing
where
once
the
river
ran
on
the
same
level
as
that
part
of
its
bed
on
which
we
sail
the
first
crack
is
in
length
a
few
yards
more
than
the
breadth
of
the
zambesi
which
by
measurement
we
found
to
be
a
little
over
yards
but
this
number
we
resolved
to
retain
as
indicating
the
year
in
which
the
fall
was
for
the
first
time
carefully
examined
the
main
stream
here
runs
nearly
north
and
south
and
the
cleft
across
it
is
nearly
east
and
west
the
depth
of
the
rift
was
measured
by
lowering
a
line
to
the
end
of
which
a
few
bullets
and
a
foot
of
white
cotton
cloth
were
tied
one
of
us
lay
with
his
head
over
a
projecting
crag
and
watched
the
descending
calico
till
after
his
companions
had
paid
out
feet
the
weight
rested
on
a
sloping
projection
probably
feet
from
the
water
below
the
actual
bottom
being
still
further
down
the
white
cloth
now
appeared
the
size
of
a
crownpiece
on
measuring
the
width
of
this
deep
cleft
by
sextant
it
was
found
at
garden
island
its
narrowest
part
to
be
eighty
yards
and
at
its
broadest
somewhat
more
into
this
chasm
of
twice
the
depth
of
niagarafall
the
river
a
full
mile
wide
rolls
with
a
deafening
roar
and
this
is
mosioatunya
or
the
victoria
falls
looking
from
garden
island
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
nearly
half
a
mile
of
water
which
has
fallen
over
that
portion
of
the
falls
to
our
right
or
west
of
our
point
of
view
is
seen
collected
in
a
narrow
channel
twenty
or
thirty
yards
wide
and
flowing
at
exactly
right
angles
to
its
previous
course
to
our
left
while
the
other
half
or
that
which
fell
over
the
eastern
portion
of
the
falls
is
seen
in
the
left
of
the
narrow
channel
below
coming
towards
our
right
both
waters
unite
midway
in
a
fearful
boiling
whirlpool
and
find
an
outlet
by
a
crack
situated
at
right
angles
to
the
fissure
of
the
falls
this
outlet
is
about
yards
from
the
western
end
of
the
chasm
and
some
from
its
eastern
end
the
whirlpool
is
at
its
commencement
the
zambesi
now
apparently
not
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
yards
wide
rushes
and
surges
south
through
the
narrow
escapechannel
for
yards
then
enters
a
second
chasm
somewhat
deeper
and
nearly
parallel
with
the
first
abandoning
the
bottom
of
the
eastern
half
of
this
second
chasm
to
the
growth
of
large
trees
it
turns
sharply
off
to
the
west
and
forms
a
promontory
with
the
escapechannel
at
its
point
of
yards
long
and
yards
broad
at
the
base
after
reaching
this
base
the
river
runs
abruptly
round
the
head
of
another
promontory
and
flows
away
to
the
east
in
a
third
chasm
then
glides
round
a
third
promontory
much
narrower
than
the
rest
and
away
back
to
the
west
in
a
fourth
chasm
and
we
could
see
in
the
distance
that
it
appeared
to
round
still
another
promontory
and
bend
once
more
in
another
chasm
towards
the
east
in
this
gigantic
zigzag
yet
narrow
trough
the
rocks
are
all
so
sharply
cut
and
angular
that
the
idea
at
once
arises
that
the
hard
basaltic
trap
must
have
been
riven
into
its
present
shape
by
a
force
acting
from
beneath
and
that
this
probably
took
place
when
the
ancient
inland
seas
were
let
off
by
similar
fissures
nearer
the
ocean
the
land
beyond
or
on
the
south
of
the
falls
retains
as
already
remarked
the
same
level
as
before
the
rent
was
made
it
is
as
if
the
trough
below
niagara
were
bent
right
and
left
several
times
before
it
reached
the
railway
bridge
the
land
in
the
supposed
bends
being
of
the
same
height
as
that
above
the
fall
would
give
standingplaces
or
points
of
view
of
the
same
nature
as
that
from
the
railwaybridge
but
the
nearest
would
be
only
eighty
yards
instead
of
two
miles
the
distance
to
the
bridge
from
the
face
of
the
cascade
the
tops
of
the
promontories
are
in
general
flat
smooth
and
studded
with
trees
the
first
with
its
base
on
the
east
is
at
one
place
so
narrow
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
walk
to
its
extremity
on
the
second
however
we
found
a
broad
rhinoceros
path
and
a
hut
but
unless
the
builder
were
a
hermit
with
a
pet
rhinoceros
we
cannot
conceive
what
beast
or
man
ever
went
there
for
on
reaching
the
apex
of
this
second
eastern
promontory
we
saw
the
great
river
of
a
deep
seagreen
colour
now
sorely
compressed
gliding
away
at
least
feet
below
us
garden
island
when
the
river
is
low
commands
the
best
view
of
the
great
fall
chasm
as
also
of
the
promontory
opposite
with
its
grove
of
large
evergreen
trees
and
brilliant
rainbows
of
threequarters
of
a
circle
two
three
and
sometimes
even
four
in
number
resting
on
the
face
of
the
vast
perpendicular
rock
down
which
tiny
streams
are
always
running
to
be
swept
again
back
by
the
upward
rushing
vapour
but
as
at
niagara
one
has
to
go
over
to
the
canadian
shore
to
see
the
chief
wonderthe
great
horseshoe
fallso
here
we
have
to
cross
over
to
moselekatses
side
to
the
promontory
of
evergreens
for
the
best
view
of
the
principal
falls
of
mosioatunya
beginning
therefore
at
the
base
of
this
promontory
and
facing
the
cataract
at
the
west
end
of
the
chasm
there
is
first
a
fall
of
thirtysix
yards
in
breadth
and
of
course
as
they
all
are
upwards
of
feet
in
depth
then
boaruka
a
small
island
intervenes
and
next
comes
a
great
fall
with
a
breadth
of
yards
a
projecting
rock
separates
this
from
a
second
grand
fall
of
yards
broad
in
all
upwards
of
yards
of
perennial
falls
further
east
stands
garden
island
then
as
the
river
was
at
its
lowest
came
a
good
deal
of
the
bare
rock
of
its
bed
with
a
score
of
narrow
falls
which
at
the
time
of
flood
constitute
one
enormous
cascade
of
nearly
another
halfmile
near
the
east
end
of
the
chasm
are
two
larger
falls
but
they
are
nothing
at
low
water
compared
to
those
between
the
islands
the
whole
body
of
water
rolls
clear
over
quite
unbroken
but
after
a
descent
of
ten
or
more
feet
the
entire
mass
suddenly
becomes
like
a
huge
sheet
of
driven
snow
pieces
of
water
leap
off
it
in
the
form
of
comets
with
tails
streaming
behind
till
the
whole
snowy
sheet
becomes
myriads
of
rushing
leaping
aqueous
comets
this
peculiarity
was
not
observed
by
charles
livingstone
at
niagara
and
here
it
happens
possibly
from
the
dryness
of
the
atmosphere
or
whatever
the
cause
may
be
which
makes
every
drop
of
zambesi
water
appear
to
possess
a
sort
of
individuality
it
runs
off
the
ends
of
the
paddles
and
glides
in
beads
along
the
smooth
surface
like
drops
of
quicksilver
on
a
table
here
we
see
them
in
a
conglomeration
each
with
a
train
of
pure
white
vapour
racing
down
till
lost
in
clouds
of
spray
a
stone
dropped
in
became
less
and
less
to
the
eye
and
at
last
disappeared
in
the
dense
mist
below
charles
livingstone
had
seen
niagara
and
gave
mosioatunya
the
palm
though
now
at
the
end
of
a
drought
and
the
river
at
its
very
lowest
many
feel
a
disappointment
on
first
seeing
the
great
american
falls
but
mosioatunya
is
so
strange
it
must
ever
cause
wonder
in
the
amount
of
water
niagara
probably
excels
though
not
during
the
months
when
the
zambesi
is
in
flood
the
vast
body
of
water
separating
in
the
comet
like
forms
described
necessarily
encloses
in
its
descent
a
large
volume
of
air
which
forced
into
the
cleft
to
an
unknown
depth
rebounds
and
rushes
up
loaded
with
vapour
to
form
the
three
or
even
six
columns
as
if
of
steam
visible
at
the
batoka
village
moachemba
twentyone
miles
distant
on
attaining
a
height
of
or
at
most
feet
from
the
level
of
the
river
above
the
cascade
this
vapour
becomes
condensed
into
a
perpetual
shower
of
fine
rain
much
of
the
spray
rising
to
the
west
of
garden
island
falls
on
the
grove
of
evergreen
trees
opposite
and
from
their
leaves
heavy
drops
are
for
ever
falling
to
form
sundry
little
rills
which
in
running
down
the
steep
face
of
rock
are
blown
off
and
turned
back
or
licked
off
their
perpendicular
bed
up
into
the
column
from
which
they
have
just
descended
the
morning
sun
gilds
these
columns
of
watery
smoke
with
all
the
glowing
colours
of
double
or
treble
rainbows
the
evening
sun
from
a
hot
yellow
sky
imparts
a
sulphureous
hue
and
gives
one
the
impression
that
the
yawning
gulf
might
resemble
the
mouth
of
the
bottomless
pit
no
bird
sits
and
sings
on
the
branches
of
the
grove
of
perpetual
showers
or
ever
builds
its
nest
there
we
saw
hornbills
and
flocks
of
little
black
weavers
flying
across
from
the
mainland
to
the
islands
and
from
the
islands
to
the
points
of
the
promontories
and
back
again
but
they
uniformly
shunned
the
region
of
perpetual
rain
occupied
by
the
evergreen
grove
the
sunshine
elsewhere
in
this
land
so
overpowering
never
penetrates
the
deep
gloom
of
that
shade
in
the
presence
of
the
strange
mosioatunya
we
can
sympathize
with
those
who
when
the
world
was
young
peopled
earth
air
and
river
with
beings
not
of
mortal
form
sacred
to
what
deity
would
be
this
awful
chasm
and
that
dark
grove
over
which
hovers
an
everabiding
pillar
of
cloud
the
ancient
batoka
chieftains
used
kazeruka
now
garden
island
and
boaruka
the
island
further
west
also
on
the
lip
of
the
falls
as
sacred
spots
for
worshipping
the
deity
it
is
no
wonder
that
under
the
cloudy
columns
and
near
the
brilliant
rainbows
with
the
ceaseless
roar
of
the
cataract
with
the
perpetual
flow
as
if
pouring
forth
from
the
hand
of
the
almighty
their
souls
should
be
filled
with
reverential
awe
it
inspired
wonder
in
the
native
mind
throughout
the
interior
among
the
first
questions
asked
by
sebituane
of
mr
oswell
and
dr
livingstone
in
was
have
you
any
smoke
soundings
in
your
country
and
what
causes
the
smoke
to
rise
for
ever
so
high
out
of
water
in
that
year
its
fame
was
heard
miles
off
and
it
was
approached
within
two
days
but
it
was
seen
by
no
european
till
when
dr
livingstone
visited
it
on
his
way
to
the
east
coast
being
then
accompanied
as
far
as
this
fall
by
sekeletu
and
followers
his
stay
was
necessarily
short
and
the
two
days
there
were
employed
in
observations
for
fixing
the
geographical
position
of
the
place
and
turning
the
showers
that
at
times
sweep
from
the
columns
of
vapour
across
the
island
to
account
in
teaching
the
makololo
arboriculture
and
making
that
garden
from
which
the
natives
named
the
island
so
that
he
did
not
visit
the
opposite
sides
of
the
cleft
nor
see
the
wonderful
course
of
the
river
beyond
the
falls
the
hippopotami
had
destroyed
the
trees
which
were
then
planted
and
though
a
strong
stockaded
hedge
was
made
again
and
living
orangetrees
cashew
nuts
and
coffee
seeds
put
in
afresh
we
fear
that
the
perseverance
of
the
hippopotami
will
overcome
the
obstacle
of
the
hedge
it
would
require
a
resident
missionary
to
rear
european
fruittrees
the
period
at
which
the
peach
and
apricot
come
into
blossom
is
about
the
end
of
the
dry
season
and
artificial
irrigation
is
necessary
the
batoka
the
only
arboriculturists
in
the
country
rear
native
fruittrees
alonethe
mosibe
the
motsikiri
the
boma
and
others
when
a
tribe
takes
an
interest
in
trees
it
becomes
more
attached
to
the
spot
on
which
they
are
planted
and
they
prove
one
of
the
civilizing
influences
where
one
englishman
goes
others
are
sure
to
follow
mr
baldwin
a
gentleman
from
natal
succeeded
in
reaching
the
falls
guided
by
his
pocketcompass
alone
on
meeting
the
second
subject
of
her
majesty
who
had
ever
beheld
the
greatest
of
african
wonders
we
found
him
a
sort
of
prisoner
at
large
he
had
called
on
mashotlane
to
ferry
him
over
to
the
north
side
of
the
river
and
when
nearly
over
he
took
a
bath
by
jumping
in
and
swimming
ashore
if
said
mashotlane
he
had
been
devoured
by
one
of
the
crocodiles
which
abound
there
the
english
would
have
blamed
us
for
his
death
he
nearly
inflicted
a
great
injury
upon
us
therefore
we
said
he
must
pay
a
fine
as
mr
baldwin
had
nothing
with
him
wherewith
to
pay
they
were
taking
care
of
him
till
he
should
receive
beads
from
his
wagon
two
days
distant
mashotlanes
education
had
been
received
in
the
camp
of
sebituane
where
but
little
regard
was
paid
to
human
life
he
was
not
yet
in
his
prime
and
his
fine
open
countenance
presented
to
us
no
indication
of
the
evil
influences
which
unhappily
from
infancy
had
been
at
work
on
his
mind
the
native
eye
was
more
penetrating
than
ours
for
the
expression
of
our
men
was
he
has
drunk
the
blood
of
menyou
may
see
it
in
his
eyes
he
made
no
further
difficulty
about
mr
baldwin
but
the
week
after
we
left
he
inflicted
a
severe
wound
on
the
head
of
one
of
his
wives
with
his
rhinoceroshorn
club
she
being
of
a
good
family
left
him
and
we
subsequently
met
her
and
another
of
his
wives
proceeding
up
the
country
the
ground
is
strewn
with
agates
for
a
number
of
miles
above
the
falls
but
the
fires
which
burn
off
the
grass
yearly
have
injured
most
of
those
on
the
surface
our
men
were
delighted
to
hear
that
they
do
as
well
as
flints
for
muskets
and
this
with
the
new
ideas
of
the
value
of
gold
dalama
and
malachite
that
they
had
acquired
at
tette
made
them
conceive
that
we
were
not
altogether
silly
in
picking
up
and
looking
at
stones
marching
up
the
river
we
crossed
the
lekone
at
its
confluence
about
eight
miles
above
the
island
kalai
and
went
on
to
a
village
opposite
the
island
chundu
nambowe
the
headman
is
one
of
the
matebele
or
zulus
who
have
had
to
flee
from
the
anger
of
moselekatse
to
take
refuge
with
the
makololo
we
spent
sunday
the
th
at
the
village
of
molele
a
tall
old
batoka
who
was
proud
of
having
formerly
been
a
great
favourite
with
sebituane
in
coming
hither
we
passed
through
patches
of
forest
abounding
in
all
sorts
of
game
the
elephants
tusks
placed
over
graves
are
now
allowed
to
decay
and
the
skulls
which
the
former
batoka
stuck
on
poles
to
ornament
their
villages
not
being
renewed
now
crumble
into
dust
here
the
famine
of
which
we
had
heard
became
apparent
moleles
people
being
employed
in
digging
up
the
tsitla
root
out
of
the
marshes
and
cutting
out
the
soft
core
of
the
young
palmtrees
for
food
the
village
situated
on
the
side
of
a
wooded
ridge
commands
an
extensive
view
of
a
great
expanse
of
meadow
and
marsh
lying
along
the
bank
of
the
river
on
these
holmes
herds
of
buffaloes
and
waterbucks
daily
graze
in
security
as
they
have
in
the
reedy
marshes
a
refuge
into
which
they
can
run
on
the
approach
of
danger
the
pretty
little
tianyane
or
ourebi
is
abundant
further
on
and
herds
of
blue
weldebeests
or
brindled
gnus
katoblepas
gorgon
amused
us
by
their
fantastic
capers
they
present
a
much
more
ferocious
aspect
than
the
lion
himself
but
are
quite
timid
we
never
could
by
waving
a
red
handkerchief
according
to
the
prescription
induce
them
to
venture
near
to
us
it
may
therefore
be
that
the
red
colour
excites
their
fury
only
when
wounded
or
hotly
pursued
herds
of
lechee
or
lechwe
now
enliven
the
meadows
and
they
and
their
younger
brother
the
graceful
poku
smaller
and
of
a
rounder
contour
race
together
towards
the
grassy
fens
we
venture
to
call
the
poku
after
the
late
major
vardon
a
noblehearted
african
traveller
but
fully
anticipate
that
some
aspiring
nimrod
will
prefer
that
his
own
name
should
go
down
to
posterity
on
the
back
of
this
buck
midway
between
tabacheu
and
the
great
falls
the
streams
begin
to
flow
westward
on
the
other
side
they
begin
to
flow
east
large
round
masses
of
granite
somewhat
like
old
castles
tower
aloft
about
the
kalomo
the
country
is
an
elevated
plateau
and
our
men
knew
and
named
the
different
plains
as
we
passed
them
by
on
the
th
we
met
a
party
from
sekeletu
who
was
now
at
sesheke
our
approach
had
been
reported
and
they
had
been
sent
to
ask
the
doctor
what
the
price
of
a
horse
ought
to
be
and
what
he
said
that
they
were
to
give
and
no
more
in
reply
they
were
told
that
by
their
having
given
nine
large
tusks
for
one
horse
before
the
doctor
came
the
griquas
would
naturally
imagine
that
the
price
was
already
settled
it
was
exceedingly
amusing
to
witness
the
exact
imitation
they
gave
of
the
swagger
of
a
certain
white
with
whom
they
had
been
dealing
and
who
had
as
they
had
perceived
evidently
wished
to
assume
an
air
of
indifference
holding
up
the
head
and
scratching
the
beard
it
was
hinted
might
indicate
not
indifference
but
vermin
it
is
well
that
we
do
not
always
know
what
they
say
about
us
the
remarks
are
often
not
quite
complimentary
and
resemble
closely
what
certain
white
travellers
say
about
the
blacks
we
made
our
camp
in
the
afternoon
abreast
of
the
large
island
called
mparira
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
chobe
francolins
quails
and
guinea
fowls
as
well
as
larger
game
were
abundant
the
makololo
headman
mokompa
brought
us
a
liberal
present
and
in
the
usual
way
which
is
considered
politeness
regretted
he
had
no
milk
as
his
cows
were
all
dry
we
got
some
honey
here
from
the
very
small
stingless
bee
called
by
the
batoka
moandi
and
by
others
the
kokomatsane
this
honey
is
slightly
acid
and
has
an
aromatic
flavour
the
bees
are
easily
known
from
their
habit
of
buzzing
about
the
eyes
and
tickling
the
skin
by
sucking
it
as
common
flies
do
the
hive
has
a
tube
of
wax
like
a
quill
for
its
entrance
and
is
usually
in
the
hollows
of
trees
mokompa
feared
that
the
tribe
was
breaking
up
and
lamented
the
condition
into
which
they
had
fallen
in
consequence
of
sekeletus
leprosy
he
did
not
know
what
was
to
become
of
them
he
sent
two
canoes
to
take
us
up
to
sesheke
his
best
canoe
had
taken
ivory
up
to
the
chief
to
purchase
goods
of
some
native
traders
from
benguela
above

the

always

mochokotsa
a
messenger
from
sekeletu
met
us
on
the
th
with
another
request
for
the
doctor
to
take
ivory
and
purchase
a
horse
he
again
declined
to
interfere
none
were
to
come
up
to
sekeletu
but
the
doctor
and
all
the
men
who
had
had
smallpox
at
tette
three
years
ago
were
to
go
back
to
moshobotwane
and
he
would
sprinkle
medicine
over
them
to
drive
away
the
infection
and
prevent
it
spreading
in
the
tribe
mochokotsa
was
told
to
say
to
sekeletu
that
the
disease
was
known
of
old
to
white
men
and
we
even
knew
the
medicine
to
prevent
it
and
were
there
any
danger
now
we
should
be
the
first
to
warn
him
of
it
why
did
not
he
go
himself
to
have
moshobotwane
sprinkle
medicine
to
drive
away
his
leprosy
we
were
not
afraid
of
his
disease
nor
of
the
fever
that
had
killed
the
teachers
and
many
makololo
at
linyanti
as
this
attempt
at
quarantine
was
evidently
the
suggestion
of
native
doctors
to
increase
their
own
importance
we
added
that
we
had
no
food
and
would
hunt
next
day
for
game
and
the
day
after
and
should
we
be
still
ordered
purification
by
their
medicine
we
should
then
return
to
our
own
country
the
message
was
not
all
of
our
dictation
our
companions
interlarded
it
with
their
own
indignant
protests
and
said
some
strong
things
in
the
tette
dialect
about
these
doctor
things
keeping
them
back
from
seeing
their
father
when
to
their
surprise
mochokotsa
told
them
he
knew
every
word
they
were
saying
as
he
was
of
the
tribe
bazizulu
and
defied
them
to
deceive
him
by
any
dialect
either
of
the
mashona
on
the
east
or
of
the
mambari
on
the
west
mochokotsa
then
repeated
our
message
twice
to
be
sure
that
he
had
it
every
word
and
went
back
again
these
chiefs
messengers
have
most
retentive
memories
they
carry
messages
of
considerable
length
great
distances
and
deliver
them
almost
word
for
word
two
or
three
usually
go
together
and
when
on
the
way
the
message
is
rehearsed
every
night
in
order
that
the
exact
words
may
be
kept
to
one
of
the
native
objections
to
learning
to
write
is
that
these
men
answer
the
purpose
of
transmitting
intelligence
to
a
distance
as
well
as
a
letter
would
and
if
a
person
wishes
to
communicate
with
any
one
in
the
town
the
best
way
to
do
so
is
either
to
go
to
or
send
for
him
and
as
for
corresponding
with
friends
very
far
off
that
is
all
very
well
for
white
people
but
the
blacks
have
no
friends
to
whom
to
write
the
only
effective
argument
for
the
learning
to
read
is
that
it
is
their
duty
to
know
the
revelation
from
their
father
in
heaven
as
it
stands
in
the
book
our
messenger
returned
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
with
you
speak
truly
says
sekeletu
the
disease
is
old
come
on
at
once
do
not
sleep
in
the
path
for
i
am
greatly
desirous
tlologelecoe
to
see
the
doctor
after
mochokotsa
left
us
we
met
some
of
mokompas
men
bringing
back
the
ivory
as
horses
were
preferred
to
the
westcoast
goods
they
were
the
bearers
of
instructions
to
mokompa
and
as
these
instructions
illustrate
the
government
of
people
who
have
learned
scarcely
anything
from
europeans
they
are
inserted
though
otherwise
of
no
importance
mashotlane
had
not
behaved
so
civilly
to
mr
baldwin
as
sekeletu
had
ordered
him
to
do
to
all
englishmen
he
had
been
very
uncivil
to
the
messengers
sent
by
moselekatse
with
letters
from
mr
moffat
treated
them
as
spies
and
would
not
land
to
take
the
bag
until
they
moved
off
on
our
speaking
to
him
about
this
he
justified
his
conduct
on
the
plea
that
he
was
set
at
the
falls
for
the
very
purpose
of
watching
these
their
natural
enemies
and
how
was
he
to
know
that
they
had
been
sent
by
mr
moffat
our
men
thereupon
reported
at
headquarters
that
mashotlane
had
cursed
the
doctor
the
instructions
to
mokompa
from
sekeletu
were
to
go
and
tell
mashotlane
that
he
had
offended
greatly
he
had
not
cursed
monare
dr
livingstone
but
sebituane
as
monare
was
now
in
the
place
of
sebituane
and
he
reverenced
him
as
he
had
done
his
father
any
fine
taken
from
mr
baldwin
was
to
be
returned
at
once
as
he
was
not
a
boer
but
an
englishman
sekeletu
was
very
angry
and
mokompa
must
not
conceal
the
message
on
finding
afterwards
that
mashotlanes
conduct
had
been
most
outrageous
to
the
batoka
sekeletu
sent
for
him
to
come
to
sesheke
in
order
that
he
might
have
him
more
under
his
own
eye
but
mashotlane
fearing
that
this
meant
the
punishment
of
death
sent
a
polite
answer
alleging
that
he
was
ill
and
unable
to
travel
sekeletu
tried
again
to
remove
mashotlane
from
the
falls
but
without
success
in
theory
the
chief
is
absolute
and
quite
despotic
in
practice
his
authority
is
limited
and
he
cannot
without
occasionally
putting
refractory
headmen
to
death
force
his
subordinates
to
do
his
will
except
the
small
rapids
by
mparira
island
near
the
mouth
of
the
chobe
the
rest
of
the
way
to
sesheke
by
water
is
smooth
herds
of
cattle
of
two
or
three
varieties
graze
on
the
islands
in
the
river
the
batoka
possessed
a
very
small
breed
of
beautiful
shape
and
remarkably
tame
and
many
may
still
be
seen
a
larger
kind
many
of
which
have
horns
pendent
and
loose
at
the
roots
and
a
still
larger
sort
with
horns
of
extraordinary
dimensionsapparently
a
burden
for
the
beast
to
carry
this
breed
was
found
in
abundance
at
lake
ngami
we
stopped
at
noon
at
one
of
the
cattleposts
of
mokompa
and
had
a
refreshing
drink
of
milk
men
of
his
standing
have
usually
several
herds
placed
at
different
spots
and
the
owner
visits
each
in
turn
while
his
headquarters
are
at
his
village
his
son
a
boy
of
ten
had
charge
of
the
establishment
during
his
fathers
absence
according
to
makololo
ideas
the
cattlepost
is
the
proper
school
in
which
sons
should
be
brought
up
here
they
receive
the
right
sort
of
educationthe
knowledge
of
pasture
and
how
to
manage
cattle
strong
easterly
winds
blow
daily
from
noon
till
midnight
and
continue
till
the
october
or
november
rains
set
in
whirlwinds
raising
huge
pillars
of
smoke
from
burning
grass
and
weeds
are
common
in
the
forenoon
we
were
nearly
caught
in
an
immense
one
it
crossed
about
twenty
yards
in
front
of
us
the
wind
apparently
rushing
into
it
from
all
points
of
the
compass
whirling
round
and
round
in
great
eddies
it
swept
up
hundreds
of
feet
into
the
air
a
continuous
dense
dark
cloud
of
the
black
pulverized
soil
mixed
with
dried
grass
off
the
plain
herds
of
the
new
antelopes
lechwe
and
poku
with
the
kokong
or
gnus
and
zebras
stood
gazing
at
us
as
we
passed
the
mirage
lifted
them
at
times
halfway
to
the
clouds
and
twisted
them
and
the
clumps
of
palms
into
strange
unearthly
forms
the
extensive
and
rich
level
plains
by
the
banks
along
the
sides
of
which
we
paddled
would
support
a
vast
population
and
might
be
easily
irrigated
from
the
zambesi
if
watered
they
would
yield
crops
all
the
year
round
and
never
suffer
loss
by
drought
the
hippopotamus
is
killed
here
with
long
lancelike
spears
we
saw
two
men
in
a
light
canoe
stealing
noiselessly
down
on
one
of
these
animals
thought
to
be
asleep
but
it
was
on
the
alert
and
they
had
quickly
to
retreat
comparatively
few
of
these
animals
now
remain
between
sesheke
and
the
falls
and
they
are
uncommonly
wary
as
it
is
certain
death
for
one
to
be
caught
napping
in
the
daytime
on
the
th
we
entered
sesheke
the
old
town
now
in
ruins
stands
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
the
people
have
built
another
on
the
same
side
a
quarter
of
a
mile
higher
up
since
their
headman
moriantsiane
was
put
to
death
for
bewitching
the
chief
with
leprosy
sekeletu
was
on
the
right
bank
near
a
number
of
temporary
huts
a
man
hailed
us
from
the
chiefs
quarters
and
requested
us
to
rest
under
the
old
kotla
or
public
meetingplace
tree
a
young
makololo
with
the
large
thighs
which
zulus
and
most
of
this
tribe
have
crossed
over
to
receive
orders
from
the
chief
who
had
not
shown
himself
to
the
people
since
he
was
affected
with
leprosy
on
returning
he
ran
for
mokele
the
headman
of
the
new
town
who
after
going
over
to
sekeletu
came
back
and
conducted
us
to
a
small
but
good
hut
and
afterwards
brought
us
a
fine
fat
ox
as
a
present
from
the
chief
this
is
a
time
of
hunger
he
said
and
we
have
no
meat
but
we
expect
some
soon
from
the
barotse
valley
we
were
entirely
out
of
food
when
we
reached
sesheke
never
was
better
meat
than
that
of
the
ox
sekeletu
sent
and
infinitely
above
the
flesh
of
all
kinds
of
game
is
beef
a
constant
stream
of
visitors
rolled
in
on
us
the
day
after
our
arrival
several
of
them
who
had
suffered
affliction
during
the
doctors
absence
seemed
to
be
much
affected
on
seeing
him
again
all
were
in
low
spirits
a
severe
drought
had
cut
off
the
crops
and
destroyed
the
pasture
of
linyanti
and
the
people
were
scattered
over
the
country
in
search
of
wild
fruits
and
the
hospitality
of
those
whose
groundnuts
arachis
hypogoea
had
not
failed
sekeletus
leprosy
brought
troops
of
evils
in
its
train
believing
himself
bewitched
he
had
suspected
a
number
of
his
chief
men
and
had
put
some
with
their
families
to
death
others
had
fled
to
distant
tribes
and
were
living
in
exile
the
chief
had
shut
himself
up
and
allowed
no
one
to
come
into
his
presence
but
his
uncle
mamire
ponwane
who
had
been
as
head
and
eyes
to
him
had
just
died
evidence
he
thought
of
the
potent
spells
of
those
who
hated
all
who
loved
the
chief
the
country
was
suffering
grievously
and
sebituanes
grand
empire
was
crumbling
to
pieces
a
large
body
of
young
barotse
had
revolted
and
fled
to
the
north
killing
a
man
by
the
way
in
order
to
put
a
bloodfeud
between
masiko
the
chief
to
whom
they
were
going
and
sekeletu
the
batoka
under
sinamane
and
muemba
were
independent
and
mashotlane
at
the
falls
was
setting
sekeletus
authority
virtually
at
defiance
sebituanes
wise
policy
in
treating
the
conquered
tribes
on
equal
terms
with
his
own
makololo
as
all
children
of
the
chief
and
equally
eligible
to
the
highest
honours
had
been
abandoned
by
his
son
who
married
none
but
makololo
women
and
appointed
to
office
none
but
makololo
men
he
had
become
unpopular
among
the
black
tribes
conquered
by
the
spear
but
more
effectually
won
by
the
subsequent
wise
and
just
government
of
his
father
strange
rumours
were
afloat
respecting
the
unseen
sekeletu
his
fingers
were
said
to
have
grown
like
eagles
claws
and
his
face
so
frightfully
distorted
that
no
one
could
recognize
him
some
had
begun
to
hint
that
he
might
not
really
be
the
son
of
the
great
sebituane
the
founder
of
the
nation
strong
in
battle
and
wise
in
the
affairs
of
state
in
the
days
of
the
great
lion
sebituane
said
his
only
sister
moriantsianes
widow
whose
husband
sekeletu
had
killed
we
had
chiefs
and
little
chiefs
and
elders
to
carry
on
the
government
and
the
great
chief
sebituane
knew
them
all
and
everything
they
did
and
the
whole
country
was
wisely
ruled
but
now
sekeletu
knows
nothing
of
what
his
underlings
do
and
they
care
not
for
him
and
the
makololo
power
is
fast
passing
away
the
native
doctors
had
given
the
case
of
sekeletu
up
they
could
not
cure
him
and
pronounced
the
disease
incurable
an
old
doctress
from
the
manyeti
tribe
had
come
to
see
what
she
could
do
for
him
and
on
her
skill
he
now
hung
his
last
hopes
she
allowed
no
one
to
see
him
except
his
mother
and
uncle
making
entire
seclusion
from
society
an
essential
condition
of
the
much
longedfor
cure
he
sent
notwithstanding
for
the
doctor
and
on
the
following
day
we
all
three
were
permitted
to
see
him
he
was
sitting
in
a
covered
wagon
which
was
enclosed
by
a
high
wall
of
closeset
reeds
his
face
was
only
slightly
disfigured
by
the
thickening
of
the
skin
in
parts
where
the
leprosy
had
passed
over
it
and
the
only
peculiarity
about
his
hands
was
the
extreme
length
of
his
fingernails
which
however
was
nothing
very
much
out
of
the
way
as
all
the
makololo
gentlemen
wear
them
uncommonly
long
he
has
the
quiet
unassuming
manners
of
his
father
sebituane
speaks
distinctly
in
a
low
pleasant
voice
and
appears
to
be
a
sensible
man
except
perhaps
on
the
subject
of
his
having
been
bewitched
and
in
this
when
alluded
to
he
exhibits
as
firm
a
belief
as
if
it
were
his
monomania
moriantsiane
my
aunts
husband
tried
the
bewitching
medicine
first
on
his
wife
and
she
is
leprous
and
so
is
her
headservant
then
seeing
that
it
succeeded
he
gave
me
a
stronger
dose
in
the
cooked
flesh
of
a
goat
and
i
have
had
the
disease
ever
since
they
have
lately
killed
ponwane
and
as
you
see
are
now
killing
me
ponwane
had
died
of
fever
a
short
time
previously
sekeletu
asked
us
for
medicine
and
medical
attendance
but
we
did
not
like
to
take
the
case
out
of
the
hands
of
the
female
physician
already
employed
it
being
bad
policy
to
appear
to
undervalue
any
of
the
profession
and
she
being
anxious
to
go
on
with
her
remedies
said
she
had
not
given
him
up
yet
but
would
try
for
another
month
if
he
was
not
cured
by
that
time
then
she
would
hand
him
over
to
the
white
doctors
but
we
intended
to
leave
the
country
before
a
month
was
up
so
mamire
with
others
induced
the
old
lady
to
suspend
her
treatment
for
a
little
she
remained
as
the
doctors
stipulated
in
the
chiefs
establishment
and
on
full
pay
sekeletu
was
told
plainly
that
the
disease
was
unknown
in
our
country
and
was
thought
exceedingly
obstinate
of
cure
that
we
did
not
believe
in
his
being
bewitched
and
we
were
willing
to
do
all
we
could
to
help
him
this
was
a
case
for
disinterested
benevolence
no
pay
was
expected
but
considerable
risk
incurred
yet
we
could
not
decline
it
as
we
had
the
trading
in
horses
having
however
none
of
the
medicines
usually
employed
in
skin
diseases
with
us
we
tried
the
local
application
of
lunar
caustic
and
hydriodate
of
potash
internally
and
with
such
gratifying
results
that
mamire
wished
the
patient
to
be
smeared
all
over
with
a
solution
of
lunar
caustic
which
he
believed
to
be
of
the
same
nature
as
the
blistering
fluid
formerly
applied
to
his
own
knee
by
mr
oswell
its
power
he
considered
irresistible
and
he
would
fain
have
had
anything
like
it
tried
on
sekeletu
it
was
a
time
of
great
scarcity
and
hunger
but
sekeletu
treated
us
hospitably
preparing
tea
for
us
at
every
visit
we
paid
him
with
the
tea
we
had
excellent
american
biscuit
and
preserved
fruits
which
had
been
brought
to
him
all
the
way
from
benguela
the
fruits
he
most
relished
were
those
preserved
in
their
own
juices
plums
apples
pears
strawberries
and
peaches
which
we
have
seen
only
among
portuguese
and
spaniards
it
made
us
anxious
to
plant
the
fruittree
seeds
we
had
brought
and
all
were
pleased
with
the
idea
of
having
these
same
fruits
in
their
own
country
mokele
the
headman
of
sesheke
and
sebituanes
sister
manchunyane
were
ordered
to
provide
us
with
food
as
sekeletus
wives
to
whom
this
duty
properly
belonged
were
at
linyanti
we
found
a
black
trader
from
the
west
coast
and
some
griqua
traders
from
the
south
both
in
search
of
ivory
ivory
is
dear
at
sesheke
but
cheaper
in
the
batoka
country
from
sinamanes
to
the
kafue
than
anywhere
else
the
trader
from
benguela
took
orders
for
goods
for
his
next
years
trip
and
offered
to
bring
tea
coffee
and
sugar
at
cent
per
cent
prices
as
in
consequence
of
a
hint
formerly
given
the
makololo
had
secured
all
the
ivory
in
the
batoga
country
to
the
east
by
purchasing
it
with
hoes
the
benguela
traders
found
it
unprofitable
to
go
thither
for
slaves
they
assured
us
that
without
ivory
the
trade
in
slaves
did
not
pay
in
this
way
and
by
the
orders
of
sekeletu
an
extensive
slavemart
was
closed
these
orders
were
never
infringed
except
secretly
we
discovered
only
two
or
three
cases
of
their
infraction
sekeletu
was
well
pleased
with
the
various
articles
we
brought
for
him
and
inquired
if
a
ship
could
not
bring
his
sugarmill
and
the
other
goods
we
had
been
obliged
to
leave
behind
at
tette
on
hearing
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
powerful
steamer
ascending
as
far
as
sinamanes
but
never
above
the
grand
victoria
falls
he
asked
with
charming
simplicity
if
a
cannon
could
not
blow
away
the
falls
so
as
to
allow
the
vessel
to
come
up
to
sesheke
to
save
the
tribe
from
breaking
up
by
the
continual
loss
of
real
makololo
it
ought
at
once
to
remove
to
the
healthy
batoka
highlands
near
the
kafue
fully
aware
of
this
sekeletu
remarked
that
all
his
people
save
two
were
convinced
that
if
they
remained
in
the
lowlands
a
few
years
would
suffice
to
cut
off
all
the
real
makololo
they
came
originally
from
the
healthy
south
near
the
confluence
of
the
likwa
and
namagari
where
fever
is
almost
unknown
and
its
ravages
had
been
as
frightful
among
them
here
as
amongst
europeans
on
the
coast
sebituanes
sister
described
its
first
appearance
among
the
tribe
after
their
settling
in
the
barotse
valley
on
the
zambesi
many
of
them
were
seized
with
a
shivering
sickness
as
if
from
excessive
cold
they
had
never
seen
the
like
before
they
made
great
fires
and
laid
the
shivering
wretches
down
before
them
but
pile
on
wood
as
they
might
they
could
not
raise
heat
enough
to
drive
the
cold
out
of
the
bodies
of
the
sufferers
and
they
shivered
on
till
they
died
but
though
all
preferred
the
highlands
they
were
afraid
to
go
there
lest
the
matebele
should
come
and
rob
them
of
their
muchloved
cattle
sebituane
with
all
his
veterans
could
not
withstand
that
enemy
and
how
could
they
be
resisted
now
that
most
of
the
brave
warriors
were
dead
the
young
men
would
break
and
run
away
the
moment
they
saw
the
terrible
matebele
being
as
much
afraid
of
them
as
the
black
conquered
tribes
are
of
the
makololo
but
if
the
doctor
and
his
wife
said
the
chiefs
and
counsellors
would
come
and
live
with
us
we
would
remove
to
the
highlands
at
once
as
moselekatse
would
not
attack
a
place
where
the
daughter
of
his
friend
moffat
was
living
the
makololo
are
by
far
the
most
intelligent
and
enterprising
of
the
tribes
we
have
met
none
but
brave
and
daring
men
remained
long
with
sebituane
his
stern
discipline
soon
eradicated
cowardice
from
his
army
death
was
the
inevitable
doom
of
the
coward
if
the
chief
saw
a
man
running
away
from
the
fight
he
rushed
after
him
with
amazing
speed
and
cut
him
down
or
waited
till
he
returned
to
the
town
and
then
summoned
the
deserter
into
his
presence
you
did
not
wish
to
die
on
the
field
you
wished
to
die
at
home
did
you
you
shall
have
your
wish
and
he
was
instantly
led
off
and
executed
the
present
race
of
young
men
are
inferior
in
most
respects
to
their
fathers
the
old
makololo
had
many
manly
virtues
they
were
truthful
and
never
stole
excepting
in
what
they
considered
the
honourable
way
of
lifting
cattle
in
fair
fight
but
this
can
hardly
be
said
of
their
sons
who
having
been
brought
up
among
the
subjected
tribes
have
acquired
some
of
the
vices
peculiar
to
a
menial
and
degraded
race
a
few
of
the
old
makololo
cautioned
us
not
to
leave
any
of
our
property
exposed
as
the
blacks
were
great
thieves
and
some
of
our
own
men
advised
us
to
be
on
our
guard
as
the
makololo
also
would
steal
a
very
few
trifling
articles
were
stolen
by
a
young
makololo
and
he
on
being
spoken
to
on
the
subject
showed
great
ingenuity
in
excusing
himself
by
a
plausible
and
untruthful
story
the
makololo
of
old
were
hard
workers
and
did
not
consider
labour
as
beneath
them
but
their
sons
never
work
regarding
it
as
fit
only
for
the
mashona
and
makalaka
servants
sebituane
seeing
that
the
rival
tribes
had
the
advantage
over
his
in
knowing
how
to
manage
canoes
had
his
warriors
taught
to
navigate
and
his
own
son
with
his
companions
paddled
the
chiefs
canoe
all
the
dishes
baskets
stools
and
canoes
are
made
by
the
black
tribes
called
manyeti
and
matlotlora
the
houses
are
built
by
the
women
and
servants
the
makololo
women
are
vastly
superior
to
any
we
have
yet
seen
they
are
of
a
light
warm
brown
complexion
have
pleasant
countenances
and
are
remarkably
quick
of
apprehension
they
dress
neatly
wearing
a
kilt
and
mantle
and
have
many
ornaments
sebituanes
sister
the
head
lady
of
sesheke
wore
eighteen
solid
brass
rings
as
thick
as
ones
finger
on
each
leg
and
three
of
copper
under
each
knee
nineteen
brass
rings
on
her
left
arm
and
eight
of
brass
and
copper
on
her
right
also
a
large
ivory
ring
above
each
elbow
she
had
a
pretty
bead
necklace
and
a
bead
sash
encircled
her
waist
the
weight
of
the
bright
brass
rings
round
her
legs
impeded
her
walking
and
chafed
her
ankles
but
as
it
was
the
fashion
she
did
not
mind
the
inconvenience
and
guarded
against
the
pain
by
putting
soft
rag
round
the
lower
rings
justice
appears
upon
the
whole
to
be
pretty
fairly
administered
among
the
makololo
a
headman
took
some
beads
and
a
blanket
from
one
of
his
men
who
had
been
with
us
the
matter
was
brought
before
the
chief
and
he
immediately
ordered
the
goods
to
be
restored
and
decreed
moreover
that
no
headman
should
take
the
property
of
the
men
who
had
returned
in
theory
all
the
goods
brought
back
belonged
to
the
chief
the
men
laid
them
at
his
feet
and
made
a
formal
offer
of
them
all
he
looked
at
the
articles
and
told
the
men
to
keep
them
this
is
almost
invariably
the
case
tuba
mokoro
however
fearing
lest
sekeletu
might
take
a
fancy
to
some
of
his
best
goods
exhibited
only
a
few
of
his
old
and
least
valuable
acquisitions
masakasa
had
little
to
show
he
had
committed
some
breach
of
native
law
in
one
of
the
villages
on
the
way
and
paid
a
heavy
fine
rather
than
have
the
matter
brought
to
the
doctors
ears
each
carrier
is
entitled
to
a
portion
of
the
goods
in
his
bundle
though
purchased
by
the
chiefs
ivory
and
they
never
hesitate
to
claim
their
rights
but
no
wages
can
be
demanded
from
the
chief
if
he
fails
to
respond
to
the
first
application
our
men
accustomed
to
our
ways
thought
that
the
english
system
of
paying
a
man
for
his
labour
was
the
only
correct
one
and
some
even
said
it
would
be
better
to
live
under
a
government
where
life
and
labour
were
more
secure
and
valuable
than
here
while
with
us
they
always
conducted
themselves
with
propriety
during
divine
service
and
not
only
maintained
decorum
themselves
but
insisted
on
other
natives
who
might
be
present
doing
the
same
when
moshobotwane
the
batoka
chief
came
on
one
occasion
with
a
number
of
his
men
they
listened
in
silence
to
the
reading
of
the
bible
in
the
makololo
tongue
but
as
soon
as
we
all
knelt
down
to
pray
they
commenced
a
vigorous
clapping
of
hands
their
mode
of
asking
a
favour
our
indignant
makololo
soon
silenced
their
noisy
accompaniment
and
looked
with
great
contempt
on
this
display
of
ignorance
nearly
all
our
men
had
learned
to
repeat
the
lords
prayer
and
the
apostles
creed
in
their
own
language
and
felt
rather
proud
of
being
able
to
do
so
and
when
they
reached
home
they
liked
to
recite
them
to
groups
of
admiring
friends
their
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
differ
in
no
respect
from
our
own
except
in
their
professed
inability
to
see
how
it
can
be
improper
for
a
man
to
have
more
than
one
wife
a
year
or
two
ago
several
of
the
wives
of
those
who
had
been
absent
with
us
petitioned
the
chief
for
leave
to
marry
again
they
thought
that
it
was
of
no
use
waiting
any
longer
their
husbands
must
be
dead
but
sekeletu
refused
permission
he
himself
had
bet
a
number
of
oxen
that
the
doctor
would
return
with
their
husbands
and
he
had
promised
the
absent
men
that
their
wives
should
be
kept
for
them
the
impatient
spouses
had
therefore
to
wait
a
little
longer
some
of
them
however
eloped
with
other
men
the
wife
of
mantlanyane
for
instance
ran
off
and
left
his
little
boy
among
strangers
mantlanyane
was
very
angry
when
he
heard
of
it
not
that
he
cared
much
about
her
deserting
him
for
he
had
two
other
wives
at
tette
but
he
was
indignant
at
her
abandoning
his
boy

with

as

is
often
the

went
off

hid
himself
for

was
doomed
to
die
and
was
carried
in

of

of

in

retained
a

with

looked

with

sebetuane
was
present
at

had
an
exalted
opinion
of

of

ever

the
ancient
costume
of
the
makololo
consisted
of
the
skin
of
a
lamb
kid
jackal
ocelot
or
other
small
animal
worn
round
and
below
the
loins
and
in

a

skin
mantle
was
thrown
over
the
shoulders
the
kaross
is

of
fashion
wear
a

and
a
skin

no

cleanly
bathing

the
makololo
women
use
water
rather
sparingly
rubbing
themselves
with
melted
butter
instead
this
keeps
off

rancid
odour

a

and
he
is
soon
back
to
you
for
thread
this
being
a
time
of
mourning
on
account
of
the
illness
of
the
chief
the
men
were
negligent
of
their
persons
they
did
not
cut
their
hair
or
have
merry
dances
or
carry
spear
and
shield
when
they
walked
abroad
the
wife
of
pitsane
was
busy
making
a
large
hut
while
we
were
in
the
town
she
informed
us
that
the
men
left
housebuilding
entirely
to
the
women
and
servants
a
round
tower
of
stakes
and
reeds
nine
or
ten
feet
high
is
raised
and
plastered
a
floor
is
next
made
of
soft
tufa
or
anthill
material
and
cowdung
this
plaster
prevents
the
poisonous
insects
called
tumpans
whose
bite
causes
fever
in
some
and
painful
sores
in
all
from
harbouring
in
the
cracks
or
soil
the
roof
which
is
much
larger
in
diameter
than
the
tower
is
made
on
the
ground
and
then
many
persons
assisting
lifted
up
and
placed
on
the
tower
and
thatched
a
plastered
reed
fence
is
next
built
up
to
meet
the
outer
part
of
the
roof
which
still
projects
a
little
over
this
fence
and
a
space
of
three
feet
remains
between
it
and
the
tower
we
slept
in
this
space
instead
of
in
the
tower
as
the
inner
door
of
the
hut
we
occupied
was
uncomfortably
small
being
only
nineteen
inches
high
and
twentytwo
inches
wide
at
the
floor
a
foot
from
the
bottom
it
measured
seventeen
inches
in
breadth
and
close
to
the
top
only
twelve
inches
so
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
get
through
it
the
tower
has
no
light
or
ventilation
except
through
this
small
door
the
reason
a
lady
assigned
for
having
the
doors
so
very
small
was
to
keep
out
the
mice
the
children
have
merry
times
especially
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
one
of
their
games
consists
of
a
little
girl
being
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
two
others
she
sits
with
outstretched
arms
as
they
walk
about
with
her
and
all
the
rest
clap
their
hands
and
stopping
before
each
hut
sing
pretty
airs
some
beating
time
on
their
little
kilts
of
cowskin
others
making
a
curious
humming
sound
between
the
songs
excepting
this
and
the
skippingrope
the
play
of
the
girls
consists
in
imitation
of
the
serious
work
of
their
mothers
building
little
huts
making
small
pots
and
cooking
pounding
corn
in
miniature
mortars
or
hoeing
tiny
gardens

of

and
small
shields
or
bows
and
arrows
or
amuse
themselves
in
making
little

or
in

they

some
too

said
to
use

but
as
soon
as
they
can
watch
the
goats
or
calves
they
are
sent
to
the
field
we
saw
many
boys
riding
on
the
calves
they
had
in
charge
but
this
is
an
innovation
since
the
arrival
of
the
english
with
their
horses
tselane
one
of
the
ladies
on
observing
dr
livingstone
noting
observations
on
the
wet
and
dry
bulb
thermometers
thought
that
he
too
was
engaged
in
play
for
on
receiving
no
reply
to
her
question
which
was
rather
difficult
to
answer
as
the
native
tongue
has
no
scientific
terms
she
said
with
roguish
glee
poor
thing
playing
like
a
little
child
like
other
africans
the
makololo
have
great
faith
in
the
power
of
medicine
they
believe
that
there
is
an
especial
medicine
for
every
ill
that
flesh
is
heir
to
mamire
is
anxious
to
have
children
he
has
six
wives
and
only
one
boy
and
he
begs
earnestly
for
child
medicine
the
mother
of
sekeletu
came
from
the
barotse
valley
to
see
her
son
thinks
she
has
lost
flesh
since
dr
livingstone
was
here
before
and
asks
for
the
medicine
of
fatness
the
makololo
consider
plumpness
an
essential
part
of
beauty
in
women
but
the
extreme
stoutness
mentioned
by
captain
speke
in
the
north
would
be
considered
hideous
here
for
the
men
have
been
overheard
speaking
of
a
lady
whom
we
call
inclined
to
embonpoint
as
fat
unto
ugliness
two
packages
from
the
kuruman
containing
letters
and
newspapers
reached
linyanti
previous
to
our
arrival
and
sekeletu
not
knowing
when
we
were
coming
left
them
there
but
now
at
once
sent
a
messenger
for
them
this
man
returned
on
the
seventh
day
having
travelled
geographical
miles
one
of
the
packages
was
too
heavy
for
him
and
he
left
it
behind
as
the
doctor
wished
to
get
some
more
medicine
and
papers
out
of
the
wagon
left
at
linyanti
in
he
decided
upon
going
thither
himself
the
chief
gave
him
his
own
horse
now
about
twelve
years
old
and
some
men
he
found
everything
in
his
wagon
as
safe
as
when
he
left
it
seven
years
before
the
headmen
mosale
and
pekonyane
received
him
cordially
and
lamented
that
they
had
so
little
to
offer
him
oh
had
he
only
arrived
the
year
previous
when
there
was
abundance
of
milk
and
corn
and
beer
very
early
the
next
morning
the
old
towncrier
mapulenyane
of
his
own
accord
made
a
public
proclamation
which
in
the
perfect
stillness
of
the
town
long
before
dawn
was
striking
i
have
dreamed
i
have
dreamed
i
have
dreamed
thou
mosale
and
thou
pekonyane
my
lords
be
not
faint
hearted
nor
let
your
hearts
be
sore
but
believe
all
the
words
of
monare
the
doctor
for
his
heart
is
white
as
milk
towards
the
makololo
i
dreamed
that
he
was
coming
and
that
the
tribe
would
live
if
you
prayed
to
god
and
give
heed
to
the
word
of
monare
mapulenyane
showed
dr
livingstone
the
buryingplace
where
poor
helmore
and
seven
others
were
laid
distinguishing
those
whom
he
had
put
to
rest
and
those
for
whom
mafale
had
performed
that
last
office
nothing
whatever
marked
the
spot
and
with
the
native
idea
of
hiding
the
dead
it
was
said
it
will
soon
be
all
overgrown
with
bushes
for
no
one
will
cultivate
there
none
but
mapulenyane
approached
the
place
the
others
stood
at
a
respectful
distance
they
invariably
avoid
everything
connected
with
the
dead
and
no
such
thing
as
taking
portions
of
human
bodies
to
make
charms
of
as
is
the
custom
further
north
has
ever
been
known
among
the
makololo
sekeletus
health
improved
greatly
during
our
visit
the
melancholy
foreboding
left
his
spirits
and
he
became
cheerful
but
resolutely
refused
to
leave
his
den
and
appear
in
public
till
he
was
perfectly
cured
and
had
regained
what
he
considered
his
good
looks
he
also
feared
lest
some
of
those
who
had
bewitched
him
originally
might
still
be
among
the
people
and
neutralize
our
remedies
as
we
expected
another
steamer
to
be
at
kongone
in
november
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
remain
in
sesheke
more
than
one
month
before
our
departure
the
chief
and
his
principal
men
expressed
in
a
formal
manner
their
great
desire
to
have
english
people
settled
on
the
batoka
highlands
at
one
time
he
proposed
to
go
as
far
as
phori
in
order
to
select
a
place
of
residence
but
as
he
afterwards
saw
reasons
for
remaining
where
he
was
till
his
cure
was
completed
he
gave
orders
to
those
sent
with
us
in
the
event
of
our
getting
on
our
return
past
the
rapids
near
tette
not
to
bring
us
to
sesheke
but
to
send
forward
a
messenger
and
he
with
the
whole
tribe
would
come
to
us
dr
kirk
being
of
the
same
age
sekeletu
was
particularly
anxious
that
he
should
come
and
live
with
him
he
said
that
he
would
cut
off
a
section
of
the
country
for
the
special
use
of
the
english
and
on
being
told
that
in
all
probability
their
descendants
would
cause
disturbance
in
his
country
he
replied
these
would
be
only
domestic
feuds
and
of
no
importance
the
great
extent
of
uncultivated
land
on
the
cool
and
now
unpeopled
highlands
has
but
to
be
seen
to
convince
the
spectator
how
much
room
there
is
and
to
spare
for
a
vastly
greater
population
than
ever
in
our
day
can
be
congregated
there
on
the
last
occasion
of
our
holding
divine
service
at
sesheke
the
men
were
invited
to
converse
on
the
subject
on
which
they
had
been
addressed
so
many
of
them
had
died
since
we
were
here
before
that
not
much
probability
existed
of
our
all
meeting
again
and
this
had
naturally
led
to
the
subject
of
a
future
state
they
replied
that
they
did
not
wish
to
offend
the
speaker
but
they
could
not
believe
that
all
the
dead
would
rise
again
can
those
who
have
been
killed
in
the
field
and
devoured
by
the
vultures
or
those
who
have
been
eaten
by
the
hyenas
or
lions
or
those
who
have
been
tossed
into
the
river
and
eaten
by
more
than
one
crocodilecan
they
all
be
raised
again
to
life
they
were
told
that
men
could
take
a
leaden
bullet
change
it
into
a
salt
acetate
of
lead
which
could
be
dissolved
as
completely
in
water
as
our
bodies
in
the
stomachs
of
animals
and
then
reconvert
it
into
lead
or
that
the
bullet
could
be
transformed
into
the
red
and
white
paint
of
our
wagons
and
again
be
reconverted
into
the
original
lead
and
that
if
men
exactly
like
themselves
could
do
so
much
how
much
more
could
he
do
who
has
made
the
eye
to
see
and
the
ear
to
hear
we
added
however
that
we
believed
in
a
resurrection
not
because
we
understood
how
it
would
be
brought
about
but
because
our
heavenly
father
assured
us
of
it
in
his
book
the
reference
to
the
truth
of
the
book
and
its
author
seems
always
to
have
more
influence
on
the
native
mind
than
the
cleverness
of
the
illustration
the
knowledge
of
the
people
is
scanty
but
their
reasoning
is
generally
clear
as
far
as
their
information
goes
we
left
sesheke
on
the
th
september
convoyed
by
pitsane
and
leshore
with
their
men
pitsane
was
ordered
by
sekeletu
to
make
a
hedge
round
the
garden
at
the
falls
to
protect
the
seeds
we
had
brought
and
also
to
collect
some
of
the
tobacco
tribute
below
the
falls
leshore
besides
acting
as
a
sort
of
guard
of
honour
to
us
was
sent
on
a
diplomatic
mission
to
sinamane
no
tribute
was
exacted
by
sekeletu
from
sinamane
but
as
he
had
sent
in
his
adhesion
he
was
expected
to
act
as
a
guard
in
case
of
the
matebele
wishing
to
cross
and
attack
the
makololo
as
we
intended
to
purchase
canoes
of
sinamane
in
which
to
descend
the
river
leshore
was
to
commend
us
to
whatever
help
this
batoka
chief
could
render
it
must
be
confessed
that
leshores
men
who
were
all
of
the
black
subject
tribes
really
needed
to
be
viewed
by
us
in
the
most
charitable
light
for
leshore
on
entering
any
village
called
out
to
the
inhabitants
look
out
for
your
property
and
see
that
my
thieves
dont
steal
it
two
young
makololo
with
their
batoka
servants
accompanied
us
to
see
if
kebrabasa
could
be
surmounted
and
to
bring
a
supply
of
medicine
for
sekeletus
leprosy
and
half
a
dozen
able
canoemen
under
mobito
who
had
previously
gone
with
dr
livingstone
to
loanda
were
sent
to
help
us
in
our
river
navigation
some
men
on
foot
drove
six
oxen
which
sekeletu
had
given
us
as
provisions
for
the
journey
it
was
as
before
remarked
a
time
of
scarcity
and
considering
the
dearth
of
food
our
treatment
had
been
liberal
by
day
the
canoemen
are
accustomed
to
keep
close
under
the
rivers
bank
from
fear
of
the
hippopotami
by
night
however
they
keep
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
as
then
those
animals
are
usually
close
to
the
bank
on
their
way
to
their
grazing
grounds
our
progress
was
considerably
impeded
by
the
high
winds
which
at
this
season
of
the
year
begin
about
eight
in
the
morning
and
blow
strongly
up
the
river
all
day
the
canoes
were
poor
leaky
affairs
and
so
low
in
parts
of
the
gunwale
that
the
paddlers
were
afraid
to
follow
the
channel
when
it
crossed
the
river
lest
the
waves
might
swamp
us
a
rough
sea
is
dreaded
by
all
these
inland
canoemen
but
though
timid
they
are
by
no
means
unskilful
at
their
work
the
ocean
rather
astonished
them
afterwards
and
also
the
admirable
way
that
the
nyassa
men
managed
their
canoes
on
a
rough
lake
and
even
amongst
the
breakers
where
no
small
boat
could
possibly
live
on
the
night
of
the
th
we
slept
on
the
left
bank
of
the
majeele
after
having
had
all
the
men
ferried
across
an
ox
was
slaughtered
and
not
an
ounce
of
it
was
left
next
morning
our
two
young
makololo
companions
maloka
and
ramakukane
having
never
travelled
before
naturally
clung
to
some
of
the
luxuries
they
had
been
accustomed
to
at
home
when
they
lay
down
to
sleep
their
servants
were
called
to
spread
their
blankets
over
their
august
persons
not
forgetting
their
feet
this
seems
to
be
the
duty
of
the
makololo
wife
to
her
husband
and
strangers
sometimes
receive
the
honour
one
of
our
party
having
wandered
slept
at
the
village
of
nambowe
when
he
laid
down
to
his
surprise
two
of
nambowes
wives
came
at
once
and
carefully
and
kindly
spread
his
kaross
over
him
a
beautiful
silvery
fish
with
reddish
fins
called
ngwesi
is
very
abundant
in
the
river
large
ones
weigh
fifteen
or
twenty
pounds
each
its
teeth
are
exposed
and
so
arranged
that
when
they
meet
the
edges
cut
a
hook
like
nippers
the
ngwesi
seems
to
be
a
very
ravenous
fish
it
often
gulps
down
the
konokono
a
fish
armed
with
serrated
bones
more
than
an
inch
in
length
in
the
pectoral
and
dorsal
fins
which
fitting
into
a
notch
at
the
roots
can
be
put
by
the
fish
on
full
cock
or
straight
outthey
cannot
be
folded
down
without
its
will
and
even
break
in
resisting
the
name
konokono
elbowelbow
is
given
it
from
a
resemblance
its
extended
fins
are
supposed
to
bear
to
a
mans
elbows
stuck
out
from
his
body
it
often
performs
the
little
trick
of
cocking
its
fins
in
the
stomach
of
the
ngwesi
and
the
elbows
piercing
its
enemys
sides
he
is
frequently
found
floating
dead
the
fin
bones
seem
to
have
an
acrid
secretion
on
them
for
the
wound
they
make
is
excessively
painful
the
konokono
barks
distinctly
when
landed
with
the
hook
our
canoemen
invariably
picked
up
every
dead
fish
they
saw
on
the
surface
of
the
water
however
far
gone
an
unfragrant
odour
was
no
objection
the
fish
was
boiled
and
eaten
and
the
water
drunk
as
soup
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
many
of
the
africans
keep
fish
as
we
do
woodcocks
until
they
are
extremely
offensive
before
they
consider
them
fit
to
eat
our
paddlers
informed
us
on
our
way
down
that
iguanas
lay
their
eggs
in
july
and
august
and
crocodiles
in
september
the
eggs
remain
a
month
or
two
under
the
sand
where
they
are
laid
and
the
young
come
out
when
the
rains
have
fairly
commenced
the
canoemen
were
quite
positive
that
crocodiles
frequently
stun
men
by
striking
them
with
their
tails
and
then
squat
on
them
till
they
are
drowned
we
once
caught
a
young
crocodile
which
certainly
did
use
its
tail
to
inflict
sharp
blows
and
led
us
to
conclude
that
the
native
opinion
is
correct
they
believed
also
that
if
a
person
shuts
the
beasts
eyes
it
lets
go
its
hold
crocodiles
have
been
known
to
unite
and
kill
a
large
one
of
their
own
species
and
eat
it
some
fishermen
throw
the
bones
of
the
fish
into
the
river
but
in
most
of
the
fishing
villages
there
are
heaps
of
them
in
various
places
the
villagers
can
walk
over
them
without
getting
them
into
their
feet
but
the
makololo
from
having
softer
soles
are
unable
to
do
so
the
explanation
offered
was
that
the
fishermen
have
a
medicine
against
fishbones
but
that
they
will
not
reveal
it
to
the
makololo
we
spent
a
night
on
mparira
island
which
is
four
miles
long
and
about
one
mile
broad
mokompa
the
headman
was
away
hunting
elephants
his
wife
sent
for
him
on
our
arrival
and
he
returned
next
morning
before
we
left
taking
advantage
of
the
longcontinued
drought
he
had
set
fire
to
the
reeds
between
the
chobe
and
zambesi
in
such
a
manner
as
to
drive
the
game
out
at
one
corner
where
his
men
laid
in
wait
with
their
spears
he
had
killed
five
elephants
and
three
buffaloes
wounding
several
others
which
escaped
on
our
land
party
coming
up
we
were
told
that
the
oxen
were
bitten
by
the
tsetse
they
could
see
a
great
difference
in
their
looks
one
was
already
eaten
and
they
now
wished
to
slaughter
another
a
third
fell
into
a
buffalopit
next
day
so
our
stock
was
soon
reduced
the
batoka
chief
moshobotwane
again
treated
us
with
his
usual
hospitality
giving
us
an
ox
some
meal
and
milk
we
took
another
view
of
the
grand
mosioatunya
and
planted
a
quantity
of
seeds
in
the
garden
on
the
island
but
as
no
one
will
renew
the
hedge
the
hippopotami
will
doubtless
soon
destroy
what
we
planted
mashotlane
assisted
us
so
much
power
was
allowed
to
this
underchief
that
he
appeared
as
if
he
had
cast
off
the
authority
of
sekeletu
altogether
he
did
not
show
much
courtesy
to
his
messengers
instead
of
giving
them
food
as
is
customary
he
took
the
meat
out
of
a
pot
in
their
presence
and
handed
it
to
his
own
followers
this
may
have
been
because
sekeletus
men
bore
an
order
to
him
to
remove
to
linyanti
he
had
not
only
insulted
baldwin
but
had
also
driven
away
the
griqua
traders
but
this
may
all
end
in
nothing
some
of
the
natives
here
and
at
sesheke
know
a
few
of
the
low
tricks
of
more
civilized
traders
a
pot
of
milk
was
brought
to
us
one
evening
which
was
more
indebted
to
the
zambesi
than
to
any
cow
baskets
of
fine
looking
white
meal
elsewhere
had
occasionally
the
lower
half
filled
with
bran
eggs
are
always
a
perilous
investment
the
native
idea
of
a
good
egg
differs
as
widely
from
our
own
as
is
possible
on
such
a
trifling
subject
an
egg
is
eaten
here
with
apparent
relish
though
an
embryo
chick
be
inside
we
left
mosioatunya
on
the
th
and
slept
close
to
the
village
of
bakwini
it
is
built
on
a
ridge
of
loose
red
soil
which
produces
great
crops
of
mapira
and
groundnuts
many
magnificent
mosibetrees
stand
near
the
village
machimisi
the
headman
of
the
village
possesses
a
herd
of
cattle
and
a
large
heart
he
kept
us
company
for
a
couple
of
days
to
guide
us
on
our
way
we
had
heard
a
good
deal
of
a
stronghold
some
miles
below
the
falls
called
kalunda
our
return
path
was
much
nearer
the
zambesi
than
that
of
our
ascentin
fact
as
near
as
the
rough
country
would
allowbut
we
left
it
twice
before
we
reached
sinamanes
in
order
to
see
kalunda
and
a
fall
called
moomba
or
moamba
the
makololo
had
once
dispossessed
the
batoka
of
kalunda
but
we
could
not
see
the
fissure
or
whatever
it
is
that
rendered
it
a
place
of
security
as
it
was
on
the
southern
bank
the
crack
of
the
great
falls
was
here
continued
the
rocks
are
the
same
as
further
up
but
perhaps
less
weatherwornand
now
partially
stratified
in
great
thick
masses
the
country
through
which
we
were
travelling
was
covered
with
a
cinderylooking
volcanic
tufa
and
might
be
called
katakaumena
the
description
we
received
of
the
moamba
falls
seemed
to
promise
something
grand
they
were
said
to
send
up
smoke
in
the
wet
season
like
mosioatunya
but
when
we
looked
down
into
the
cleft
in
which
the
darkgreen
narrow
river
still
rolls
we
saw
about
or
feet
below
us
what
after
mosioatunya
seemed
two
insignificant
cataracts
it
was
evident
that
pitsane
observing
our
delight
at
the
victoria
falls
wished
to
increase
our
pleasure
by
a
second
wonder
one
mosioatunya
however
is
quite
enough
for
a
continent
we
had
now
an
opportunity
of
seeing
more
of
the
batoka
than
we
had
on
the
highland
route
to
our
north
they
did
not
wait
till
the
evening
before
offering
food
to
the
strangers
the
aged
wife
of
the
headman
of
a
hamlet
where
we
rested
at
midday
at
once
kindled
a
fire
and
put
on
the
cookingpot
to
make
porridge
both
men
and
women
are
to
be
distinguished
by
greater
roundness
of
feature
than
the
other
natives
and
the
custom
of
knocking
out
the
upper
front
teeth
gives
at
once
a
distinctive
character
to
the
face
their
colour
attests
the
greater
altitude
of
the
country
in
which
many
of
them
formerly
lived
some
however
are
as
dark
as
the
bashubia
and
barotse
of
the
great
valley
to
their
west
in
which
stands
sesheke
formerly
the
capital
of
the
balui
or
bashubia
the
assertion
may
seem
strange
yet
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
in
all
the
tribes
we
have
visited
we
never
saw
a
really
black
person
different
shades
of
brown
prevail
and
often
with
a
bright
bronze
tint
which
no
painter
except
mr
angus
seems
able
to
catch
those
who
inhabit
elevated
dry
situations
and
who
are
not
obliged
to
work
much
in
the
sun
are
frequently
of
a
light
warm
brown
dark
but
comely
darkness
of
colour
is
probably
partly
caused
by
the
sun
and
partly
by
something
in
the
climate
or
soil
which
we
do
not
yet
know
we
see
something
of
the
same
sort
in
trout
and
other
fish
which
take
their
colour
from
the
ponds
or
streams
in
which
they
live
the
members
of
our
party
were
much
less
embrowned
by
free
exposure
to
the
sun
for
years
than
dr
livingstone
and
his
family
were
by
passing
once
from
kuruman
to
cape
town
a
journey
which
occupied
only
a
couple
of
months
we
encamped
on
the
kalomo
on
the
st
of
october
and
found
the
weather
very
much
warmer
than
when
we
crossed
this
stream
in
august
at
pm
the
thermometer
four
feet
from
the
ground
was
degrees
in
the
shade
the
wet
bulb
only
degrees
a
difference
of
degrees
yet
notwithstanding
this
extreme
dryness
of
the
atmosphere
without
a
drop
of
rain
having
fallen
for
months
and
scarcely
any
dew
many
of
the
shrubs
and
trees
were
putting
forth
fresh
leaves
of
various
hues
while
others
made
a
profuse
display
of
lovely
blossoms
two
old
and
very
savage
buffaloes
were
shot
for
our
companions
on
the
rd
october
our
volunteers
may
feel
an
interest
in
knowing
that
balls
sometimes
have
but
little
effect
one
buffalo
fell
on
receiving
a
jacobs
shell
it
was
hit
again
twice
and
lost
a
large
amount
of
blood
and
yet
it
sprang
up
and
charged
a
native
who
by
great
agility
had
just
time
to
climb
a
tree
before
the
maddened
beast
struck
it
battering
ram
fashion
hard
enough
almost
to
have
split
both
head
and
tree
it
paused
a
few
secondsdrew
back
several
pacesglared
up
at
the
manand
then
dashed
at
the
tree
again
and
again
as
if
determined
to
shake
him
out
of
it
it
took
two
more
jacobs
shells
and
five
other
large
solid
rifleballs
to
finish
the
beast
at
last
these
old
surly
buffaloes
had
been
wandering
about
in
a
sort
of
miserable
fellowship
their
skins
were
diseased
and
scabby
as
if
leprous
and
their
horns
atrophied
or
worn
down
to
stumpsthe
first
was
killed
outright
by
one
jacobs
shell
the
second
died
hard
there
is
so
much
difference
in
the
tenacity
of
life
in
wounded
animals
of
the
same
species
that
the
inquiry
is
suggested
where
the
seat
of
life
can
bewe
have
seen
a
buffalo
live
long
enough
after
a
large
bullet
had
passed
right
through
the
heart
to
allow
firm
adherent
clots
to
be
formed
in
the
two
holes
one
days
journey
above
sinamanes
a
mass
of
mountain
called
gorongue
or
golongwe
is
said
to
cross
the
river
and
the
rent
through
which
the
river
passes
is
by
native
report
quite
fearful
to
behold
the
country
round
it
is
so
rocky
that
our
companions
dreaded
the
fatigue
and
were
not
much
to
blame
if
as
is
probably
the
case
the
way
be
worse
than
that
over
which
we
travelled
as
we
trudged
along
over
the
black
slag
like
rocks
the
almost
leafless
trees
affording
no
shade
the
heat
was
quite
as
great
as
europeans
could
bear
it
was
degrees
in
the
shade
and
a
thermometer
placed
under
the
tongue
or
armpit
showed
that
our
blood
was
degrees
or
degrees
hotter
than
that
of
the
natives
which
stood
at
degrees
our
shoes
however
enable
us
to
pass
over
the
hot
burning
soil
better
than
they
can
many
of
those
who
wear
sandals
have
corns
on
the
sides
of
the
feet
and
on
the
heels
where
the
straps
pass
we
have
seen
instances
too
where
neither
sandals
nor
shoes
were
worn
of
corns
on
the
soles
of
the
feet
it
is
moreover
not
at
all
uncommon
to
see
toes
cocked
up
as
if
pressed
out
of
their
proper
places
at
home
we
should
have
unhesitatingly
ascribed
this
to
the
vicious
fashions
perversely
followed
by
our
shoemakers
on
the
th
after
crossing
some
hills
we
rested
at
the
village
of
simariango
the
bellows
of
the
blacksmith
here
were
somewhat
different
from
the
common
goatskin
bags
and
more
like
those
seen
in
madagascar
they
consisted
of
two
wooden
vessels
like
a
ladys
bandbox
of
small
dimensions
the
upper
ends
of
which
were
covered
with
leather
and
looked
something
like
the
heads
of
drums
except
that
the
leather
bagged
in
the
centre
they
were
fitted
with
long
nozzles
through
which
the
air
was
driven
by
working
the
loose
covering
of
the
tops
up
and
down
by
means
of
a
small
piece
of
wood
attached
to
their
centres
the
blacksmith
said
that
tin
was
obtained
from
a
people
in
the
north
called
marendi
and
that
he
had
made
it
into
bracelets
we
had
never
heard
before
of
tin
being
found
in
the
country
our
course
then
lay
down
the
bed
of
a
rivulet
called
mapatizia
in
which
there
was
much
calc
spar
with
calcareous
schist
and
then
the
tette
grey
sandstone
which
usually
overlies
coal
on
the
th
we
arrived
at
the
islet
chilombe
belonging
to
sinamane
where
the
zambesi
runs
broad
and
smooth
again
and
were
well
received
by
sinamane
himself
never
was
sunday
more
welcome
to
the
weary
than
this
the
last
we
were
to
spend
with
our
convoy
we
now
saw
many
goodlooking
young
men
and
women
the
dresses
of
the
ladies
are
identical
with
those
of
nubian
women
in
upper
egypt
to
a
belt
on
the
waist
a
great
number
of
strings
are
attached
to
hang
all
round
the
person
these
fringes
are
about
six
or
eight
inches
long
the
matrons
wear
in
addition
a
skin
cut
like
the
tails
of
the
coatee
formerly
worn
by
our
dragoons
the
younger
girls
wear
the
waistbelt
exhibited
in
the
woodcut
ornamented
with
shells
and
have
the
fringes
only
in
front
marauding
parties
of
batoka
calling
themselves
makololo
have
for
some
time
had
a
wholesome
dread
of
sinamanes
long
spears
before
going
to
tette
our
batoka
friend
masakasa
was
one
of
a
party
that
came
to
steal
some
of
the
young
women
but
sinamane
to
their
utter
astonishment
attacked
them
so
furiously
that
the
survivors
barely
escaped
with
their
lives
masakasa
had
to
flee
so
fast
that
he
threw
away
his
shield
his
spear
and
his
clothes
and
returned
home
a
wiser
and
a
sadder
man
sinamanes
people
cultivate
large
quantities
of
tobacco
which
they
manufacture
into
balls
for
the
makololo
market
twenty
balls
weighing
about
threequarters
of
a
pound
each
are
sold
for
a
hoe
the
tobacco
is
planted
on
low
moist
spots
on
the
banks
of
the
zambesi
and
was
in
flower
at
the
time
we
were
there
in
october
sinamanes
people
appear
to
have
abundance
of
food
and
are
all
in
good
condition
he
could
sell
us
only
two
of
his
canoes
but
lent
us
three
more
to
carry
us
as
far
as
moembas
where
he
thought
others
might
be
purchased
they
were
manned
by
his
own
canoemen
who
were
to
bring
them
back
the
river
is
about
yards
wide
and
flows
serenely
between
high
banks
towards
the
northeast
below
sinamanes
the
banks
are
often
worn
down
fifty
feet
and
composed
of
shingle
and
gravel
of
igneous
rocks
sometimes
set
in
a
ferruginous
matrix
the
bottom
is
all
gravel
and
shingle
how
formed
we
cannot
imagine
unless
in
potholes
in
the
deep
fissure
above
the
bottom
above
the
falls
save
a
few
rocks
close
by
them
is
generally
sandy
or
of
soft
tufa
every
damp
spot
is
covered
with
maize
pumpkins
watermelons
tobacco
and
hemp
there
is
a
pretty
numerous
batoka
population
on
both
sides
of
the
river
as
we
sailed
slowly
down
the
people
saluted
us
from
the
banks
by
clapping
their
hands
a
headman
even
hailed
us
and
brought
a
generous
present
of
corn
and
pumpkins
moemba
owns
a
rich
island
called
mosanga
a
mile
in
length
on
which
his
village
stands
he
has
the
reputation
of
being
a
brave
warrior
and
is
certainly
a
great
talker
but
he
gave
us
strangers
something
better
than
a
stream
of
words
we
received
a
handsome
present
of
corn
and
the
fattest
goat
we
had
ever
seen
it
resembled
mutton
his
people
were
as
liberal
as
their
chief
they
brought
two
large
baskets
of
corn
and
a
lot
of
tobacco
as
a
sort
of
general
contribution
to
the
travellers
one
of
sinamanes
canoemen
after
trying
to
get
his
pay
deserted
here
and
went
back
before
the
stipulated
time
with
the
story
that
the
englishman
had
stolen
the
canoes
shortly
after
sunrise
next
morning
sinamane
came
into
the
village
with
fifty
of
his
long
spears
evidently
determined
to
retake
his
property
by
force
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
his
man
had
deceived
him
moemba
rallied
him
for
coming
on
a
wildgoose
chase
here
are
your
canoes
left
with
me
your
men
have
all
been
paid
and
the
englishmen
are
now
asking
me
to
sell
my
canoes
sinamane
said
little
to
us
only
observing
that
he
had
been
deceived
by
his
follower
a
single
remark
of
his
chiefs
caused
the
foolish
fellow
to
leave
suddenly
evidently
much
frightened
and
crestfallen
sinamane
had
been
very
kind
to
us
and
as
he
was
looking
on
when
we
gave
our
present
to
moemba
we
made
him
also
an
additional
offering
of
some
beads
and
parted
good
friends
moemba
having
heard
that
we
had
called
the
people
of
sinamane
together
to
tell
them
about
our
saviours
mission
to
man
and
to
pray
with
them
associated
the
idea
of
sunday
with
the
meeting
and
before
anything
of
the
sort
was
proposed
came
and
asked
that
he
and
his
people
might
be
sundayed
as
well
as
his
neighbours
and
be
given
a
little
seed
wheat
and
fruittree
seeds
with
which
request
of
course
we
very
willingly
complied
the
idea
of
praying
direct
to
the
supreme
being
though
not
quite
new
to
all
seems
to
strike
their
minds
so
forcibly
that
it
will
not
be
forgotten
sinamane
said
that
he
prayed
to
god
morungo
and
made
drinkofferings
to
him
though
he
had
heard
of
us
he
had
never
seen
white
men
before
beautiful
crowned
cranes
named
from
their
note
mawang
were
seen
daily
and
were
beginning
to
pair
large
flocks
of
spurwinged
geese
or
machikwe
were
common
this
goose
is
said
to
lay
her
eggs
in
march
we
saw
also
pairs
of
egyptian
geese
as
well
as
a
few
of
the
knobnosed
or
as
they
are
called
in
india
combed
geese
when
the
egyptian
geese
as
at
the
present
time
have
young
the
goslings
keep
so
steadily
in
the
wake
of
their
mother
that
they
look
as
if
they
were
a
part
of
her
tail
and
both
parents
when
on
land
simulate
lameness
quite
as
well
as
our
plovers
to
draw
off
pursuers
the
ostrich
also
adopts
the
lapwing
fashion
but
no
quadrupeds
do
they
show
fight
to
defend
their
young
instead
in
some
places
the
steep
banks
were
dotted
with
the
holes
which
lead
into
the
nests
of
beeeaters
these
birds
came
out
in
hundreds
as
we
passed
when
the
redbreasted
species
settle
on
the
trees
they
give
them
the
appearance
of
being
covered
with
red
foliage
on
the
morning
of
the
th
october
we
passed
through
a
wild
hilly
country
with
fine
wooded
scenery
on
both
sides
but
thinly
inhabited
the
largest
trees
were
usually
thorny
acacias
of
great
size
and
beautiful
forms
as
we
sailed
by
several
villages
without
touching
the
people
became
alarmed
and
ran
along
the
banks
spears
in
hand
we
employed
one
to
go
forward
and
tell
mpande
of
our
coming
this
allayed
their
fears
and
we
went
ashore
and
took
breakfast
near
the
large
island
with
two
villages
on
it
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
zungwe
where
we
had
left
the
zambesi
on
our
way
up
mpande
was
sorry
that
he
had
no
canoes
of
his
own
to
sell
but
he
would
lend
us
two
he
gave
us
cooked
pumpkins
and
a
watermelon
his
servant
had
lateral
curvature
of
the
spine
we
have
often
seen
cases
of
humpback
but
this
was
the
only
case
of
this
kind
of
curvature
we
had
met
with
mpande
accompanied
us
himself
in
his
own
vessel
till
we
had
an
opportunity
of
purchasing
a
fine
large
canoe
elsewhere
we
paid
what
was
considered
a
large
price
for
it
twelve
strings
of
blue
cut
glass
neck
beads
an
equal
number
of
large
blue
ones
of
the
size
of
marbles
and
two
yards
of
grey
calico
had
the
beads
been
coarser
they
would
have
been
more
valued
because
such
were
in
fashion
before
concluding
the
bargain
the
owner
said
his
bowels
yearned
for
his
canoe
and
we
must
give
a
little
more
to
stop
their
yearning
this
was
irresistible
the
trading
party
of
sequasha
which
we
now
met
had
purchased

had
bought
for
the
merest
trifle
ivory
enough
to
load
them
all
they
were
driving
a
trade
in
slaves
also
which
was
something
new
in
this
part
of
africa
and
likely
soon
to
change
the
character
of
the
inhabitants
these
men
had
been
living
in
clover
and
were
uncommonly
fat
and
plump
when
sent
to
trade
slaves
wisely
never
stint
themselves
of
beer
or
anything
else

their

can
buy
the
temperature
of
the
zambesi
had
increased
degrees
since
august
being
now
degrees
the
air
was
as
high
as
degrees
after
sunset
and
the
vicinity
of
the
water
being
the
coolest
part
we
usually
made
our
beds
close
by
the
rivers

though
there
in

africa
differs
from
india
in
the
air
always
becoming
cool
and
refreshing
long
before
the
sun
returns
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
we
can
in
this
country
bear
exposure
to
the
sun
which
would
be
fatal
in
india
it
is
probably
owing
to
the
greater
dryness
of
the
african
atmosphere
that
sunstroke
is
so
rarely
met
with
in
twentytwo
years
dr
livingstone
never
met
or
heard
of
a
single
case
though
the
protective
headdresses
of
india
are
rarely
seen
when
the
water
is
nearly
at
its
lowest
we
occasionally
meet
with
small
rapids
which
are
probably
not
in
existence
during
the
rest
of
the
year
having
slept
opposite
the
rivulet
bume
which
comes
from
the
south
we
passed
the
island
of
nakansalo
and
went
down
the
rapids
of
the
same
name
on
the
th
and
came
on
the
morning
of
the
th
to
the
more
serious
ones
of
nakabele
at
the
entrance
to
kariba
the
makololo
guided
the
canoes
admirably
through
the
opening
in
the
dyke
when
we
entered
the
gorge
we
came
on
upwards
of
thirty
hippopotami
a
bank
near
the
entrance
stretches
twothirds
across
the
narrowed
river
and
in
the
still
place
behind
it
they
were
swimming
about
several
were
in
the
channel
and
our
canoemen
were
afraid
to
venture
down
among
them
because
as
they
affirm
there
is
commonly
an
illnatured
one
in
a
herd
which
takes
a
malignant
pleasure
in
upsetting
canoes
two
or
three
boys
on
the
rocks
opposite
amused
themselves
by
throwing
stones
at
the
frightened
animals
and
hit
several
on
the
head
it
would
have
been
no
difficult
matter
to
have
shot
the
whole
herd
we
fired
a
few
shots
to
drive
them
off
the
balls
often
glance
off
the
skull
and
no
more
harm
is
done
than
when
a
schoolboy
gets
a
bloody
nose
we
killed
one
which
floated
away
down
the
rapid
current
followed
by
a
number
of
men
on
the
bank
a
native
called
to
us
from
the
left
bank
and
said
that
a
man
on
his
side
knew
how
to
pray
to
the
kariba
gods
and
advised
us
to
hire
him
to
pray
for
our
safety
while
we
were
going
down
the
rapids
or
we
should
certainly
all
be
drowned
no
one
ever
risked
his
life
in
kariba
without
first
paying
the
riverdoctor
or
priest
for
his
prayers
our
men
asked
if
there
was
a
cataract
in
front
but
he
declined
giving
any
information
they
were
not
on
his
side
of
the
river
if
they
would
come
over
then
he
might
be
able
to
tell
them
we
crossed
but
he
went
off
to
the
village
we
then
landed
and
walked
over
the
hills
to
have
a
look
at
karaba
before
trusting
our
canoes
in
it
the
current
was
strong
and
there
was
broken
water
in
some
places
but
the
channel
was
nearly
straight
and
had
no
cataract
so
we
determined
to
risk
it
our
men
visited
the
village
while
we
were
gone
and
were
treated
to
beer
and
tobacco
the
priest
who
knows
how
to
pray
to
the
god
that
rules
the
rapids
followed
us
with
several
of
his
friends
and
they
were
rather
surprised
to
see
us
pass
down
in
safety
without
the
aid
of
his
intercession
the
natives
who
followed
the
dead
hippopotamus
caught
it
a
couple
of
miles
below
and
having
made
it
fast
to
a
rock
were
sitting
waiting
for
us
on
the
bank
beside
the
dead
animal
as
there
was
a
considerable
current
there
and
the
rocky
banks
were
unfit
for
our
beds
we
took
the
hippopotamus
in
tow
telling
the
villagers
to
follow
and
we
would
give
them
most
of
the
meat
the
crocodiles
tugged
so
hard
at
the
carcass
that
we
were
soon
obliged
to
cast
it
adrift
to
float
down
in
the
current
to
avoid
upsetting
the
canoe
we
had
to
go
on
so
far
before
finding
a
suitable
spot
to
spend
the
night
in
that
the
natives
concluded
we
did
not
intend
to
share
the
meat
with
them
and
returned
to
the
village
we
slept
two
nights
at
the
place
where
the
hippopotamus
was
cut
up
the
crocodiles
had
a
busy
time
of
it
in
the
dark
tearing
away
at
what
was
left
in
the
river
and
thrashing
the
water
furiously
with
their
powerful
tails
the
hills
on
both
sides
of
kariba
are
much
like
those
of
kebrabasa
the
strata
tilted
and
twisted
in
every
direction
with
no
level
ground
although
the
hills
confine
the
zambesi
within
a
narrow
channel
for
a
number
of
miles
there
are
no
rapids
beyond
those
near
the
entrance
the
river
is
smooth
and
apparently
very
deep
only
one
single
human
being
was
seen
in
the
gorge
the
country
being
too
rough
for
culture
some
rocks
in
the
water
near
the
outlet
of
kariba
at
a
distance
look
like
a
fort
and
such
large
masses
dislocated
bent
and
even
twisted
to
a
remarkable
degree
at
once
attest
some
tremendous
upheaving
and
convulsive
action
of
nature
which
probably
caused
kebrabasa
kariba
and
the
victoria
falls
to
assume
their
present
forms
it
took
place
after
the
formation
of
the
coal
that
mineral
having
then
been
tilted
up
we
have
probably
nothing
equal
to
it
in
the
present
quiet
operations
of
nature
on
emerging
we
pitched
our
camp
by
a
small
stream
the
pendele

few
miles
below
the
gorge
the
palabi
mountain

on
the
western

chikumbula
a
hospitable
old
headman
under
nchomokela
the
paramount
chief
of
a
large
district
whom
we
did
not
see
brought
us
next
morning
a
great
basket
of
meal
and
four
fowls
with
some
beer
and
a
cake
of
salt
to
make
it
taste
good
chikumbula
said
that
the
elephants
plagued
them
by
eating
up
the
cotton
plants
but
his
people
seem
to
be
well
off
a
few
days
before
we
came
they
caught
three
buffaloes
in
pitfalls
in
one
night
and
unable
to
eat
them
all
left
one
to
rot
during
the
night
the
wind
changed
and
blew
from
the
dead
buffalo
to
our
sleepingplace
and
a
hungry
lion
not
at
all
dainty
in
his
food
stirred
up
the
putrid
mass
and
growled
and
gloated
over
his
feast
to
the
disturbance
of
our
slumbers
game
of
all
kinds
is
in
most
extraordinary
abundance
especially
from
this
point
to
below
the
kafue
and
so
it
is
on
moselekatsos
side
where
there
are
no
inhabitants
the
drought

all
the
game
to
the

a

swarming
with
wild
animals
vast
herds
of
pallahs
many
waterbucks
koodoos
buffaloes
wild
pigs
elands
zebras
and
monkeys
appear
francolins
guineafowls
and
myriads
of
turtledoves
attract
the
eye
in
the
covers
with
the
fresh
spoor
of
elephants
and
rhinoceroses
which
had
been
at
the
river
during
the
night
every
few
miles
we
came
upon
a
school
of
hippopotami
asleep
on
some
shallow
sandbank
their
bodies
nearly
all
out
of
the
water
appeared
like
masses
of
black
rock
in
the
river
when
these
animals
are
hunted
much
they
become
proportionably
wary
but
here
no
hunter
ever
troubles
them
and
they
repose
in
security
always
however
taking
the
precaution
of
sleeping
just
above
the
deep
channel
into
which
they
can
plunge
when
alarmed
when
a
shot
is
fired
into
a
sleeping
herd
all
start
up
on
their
feet
and
stare
with
peculiar
stolid
looks
of
hippopotamic
surprise
and
wait
for
another
shot
before
dashing
into
deep
water
a
few
miles
below
chikumbulas
we
saw
a
white
hippopotamus
in
a
herd
our
men
had
never
seen
one
like
it
before
it
was
of
a
pinkish
white
exactly
like
the
colour
of
the
albino
it
seemed
to
be
the
father
of
a
number
of
others
for
there
were
many
marked
with
large
light
patches
the
socalled
white
elephant
is
just
such
a
pinkish
albino
as
this
hippopotamus
a
few
miles
above
kariba
we
observed
that
in
two
small
hamlets
many
of
the
inhabitants
had
a
similar
affection
of
the
skin
the
same
influence
appeared
to
have
affected
man
and
beast
a
dark
coloured
hippopotamus
stood
alone
as
if
expelled
from
the
herd
and
bit
the
water
shaking
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
a
most
frantic
manner
when
the
female
has
twins
she
is
said
to
kill
one
of
them
we
touched
at
the
beautiful
treecovered
island
of
kalabi
opposite
where
tubamokoro
lectured
the

our
way

who
now
inhabit
this
island
possessed
cattle
the
tsetse
has
taken
possession
of
the
country
since
the
beeves
were
lifted
no
one
knows
where
these
insects
breed
at
a
certain
season
all
disappear
and
as
suddenly
come
back
no
one
knows
whence
the
natives
are
such
close
observers
of
nature
that
their
ignorance
in
this
case
surprised
us
a
solitary
hippopotamus
had
selected
the
little
bay
in
which
we
landed
and
where
the
women
drew
water
for
his
dwellingplace
pretty
little
lizards
with
light
blue
and
red
tails
run
among
the
rocks

flies
and
other
insects

perform
good
service
to

by
eating
great
numbers
of
the

white
ants
at
noon
on
the
th
october
we
found
sequasha
in
a
village
below
the
kafue
with
the
main
body
of
his
people
he
said
that
elephants
had
been
killed
during
his
trip
many
of
his
men
being
excellent
hunters
the
numbers
of
animals
we
saw
renders
this
possible
he
reported
that
after
reaching
the
kafue
he
went
northwards
into
the
country
of
the
zulus
whose
ancestors
formerly
migrated
from
the
south
and
set
up
a
sort
of
republican
form
of
government
sequasha
is
the
greatest
portuguese
traveller
we
ever
became
acquainted
with
and
he
boasts
that
he
is
able
to
speak
a
dozen
different
dialects
yet
unfortunately
he
can
give
but
a
very
meagre
account
of
the
countries
and
people
he
has
seen
and
his
statements
are
not
very
much
to
be
relied
on
but
considering
the
influence
among
which
he
has
been
reared
and
the
want
of
the
means
of
education
at
tette
it
is
a
wonder
that
he
possesses
the
good
traits
that
he
sometimes
exhibits
among
his
wares
were
several
cheap
american
clocks
a
useless
investment
rather
for
a
part
of
africa
where
no
one
cares
for
the
artificial
measurement
of
time
these
clocks
got
him
into
trouble
among
the
banyai
he
set
them
all
agoing
in
the
presence
of
a
chief
who
became
frightened
at
the
strange
sounds
they
made
and
looked
upon
them
as
so
many
witchcraft
agencies
at
work
to
bring
all
manner
of
evils
upon
himself
and
his
people
sequasha
it
was
decided
had
been
guilty
of
a
milando
or
crime
and
he
had
to
pay
a
heavy
fine
of
cloth
and
beads
for
his
exhibition
he
alluded
to
our
having
heard
that
he
had
killed
mpangwe
and
he
denied
having
actually
done
so
but
in
his
absence
his
name
had
got
mixed
up
in
the
affair
in
consequence
of
his
slaves
while
drinking
beer
one
night
with
namakusuru
the
man
who
succeeded
mpangwe
saying
that
they
would
kill
the
chief
for
him
his
partner
had
not
thought
of
this
when
we
saw
him
on
the
way
up
for
he
tried
to
excuse
the
murder
by
saying
that
now
they
had
put
the
right
man
into
the
chieftainship
after
three
hours
sail
on
the
morning
of
the
th
the
river
was
narrowed
again
by
the
mountains
of
mburuma
called
karivua
into
one
channel
and
another
rapid
dimly
appeared
it
was
formed
by
two
currents
guided
by
rocks
to
the
centre
in
going
down
it
the
men
sent
by
sekeletu
behaved
very
nobly
the
canoes
entered
without
previous
survey
and
the
huge
jobbling
waves
of
midcurrent
began
at
once
to
fill
them
with
great
presence
of
mind
and
without
a
moments
hesitation
two
men
lightened
each
by
jumping
overboard
they
then
ordered
a
botoka
man
to
do
the
same
as
the
white
men
must
be
saved
i
cannot
swim
said
the
batoka
jump
out
then
and
hold
on
to
the
canoe
which
he
instantly
did
swimming
alongside
they
guided
the
swamping
canoes
down
the
swift
current
to
the
foot
of
the
rapid
and
then
ran
them
ashore
to
bale
them
out
a
boat
could
have
passed
down
safely
but
our
canoes
were
not
a
foot
above
the
water
at
the
gunwales
thanks
to
the
bravery
of
these
poor
fellows
nothing
was
lost
although
everything
was
well
soaked
this
rapid

nearly
opposite
the
west
end
of
the
mburuma
mountains

karivua
another

below
it
they
are
said
to
be
all
smoothed
over
when
the
river
rises
the
canoes
had
to
be
unloaded
at
this
the
worst
rapid
and
the
goods
carried
about
a
hundred
yards
by
taking
the
time
in
which
a
piece
of
stick
floated
past
feet
we
found
the
current
to
be
running
six
knots
by
far
the
greatest
velocity
noted
in
the
river
as
the
men
were
bringing
the
last
canoe
down
close
to
the
shore
the
stern
swung
round
into
the
current
and
all
except
one
man
let
go
rather
than
be
dragged
off
he
clung
to
the
bow
and
was
swept
out
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
having
held
on
when
he
ought
to
have
let
go
he
next
put
his
life
in
jeopardy
by
letting
go
when
he
ought
to
have
held
on
and
was
in
a
few
seconds
swallowed
up
by
a
fearful
whirlpool
his
comrades
launched
out
a
canoe
below
and
caught
him
as
he
rose
the
third
time
to
the
surface
and
saved
him
though
much
exhausted
and
very
cold
the
scenery
of
this
pass
reminded
us
of
kebrabasa
although
it
is
much
inferior
a
band
of
the
same
black
shining
glaze
runs
along
the
rocks
about
two
feet
from
the

edge
there
was
not
a
blade
of
grass
on
some
of
the
hills
it
being
the
end
of
the
usual
dry
season
succeeding
a
previous
severe
drought
yet
the
hillsides
were
dotted
over
with
beautiful
green
trees
a
few
antelopes
were
seen
on
the
rugged
slopes
where
some
people
too
appeared
lying
down
taking
a
cup
of
beer
the
karivua
narrows
are
about
thirty
miles
in
length
they
end
at
the
mountain
roganora
two
rocks
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
above
the
water
at
the
time
we
were
there
may
in
flood
be
covered
and
dangerous
our
chief
danger
was
the
wind
a
very
slight
ripple
being
sufficient
to
swamp

healed
a
great
deal
of
the
plant
pistia
stratiotes
was
seen
floating
in
the
river
many
people
inhabit
the
right
bank
about
this
part
yet
the
game
is
very
abundant
as
we
were
taking
our
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
the
nd
the
mambo
kazai
of
whom
we
knew
nothing
and
his
men
came
with
their
muskets
and
large
powderhorns
to
levy
a
fine
and
obtain
payment
for
the
wood
we
used
in
cooking
but
on
our
replying
to
his
demand
that
we
were
english
oh
are
you
he
said
i
thought
you
were
bazungu
portuguese
they
are
the
people
i
take
payments
from
and
he
apologized
for
his
mistake
bazungu
or
azungu
is
a
term
applied
to
all
foreigners
of
a
light
colour
and
to
arabs
even
to
trading
slaves
if
clothed
it
probably
means
foreigners
or
visitorsfrom
zunga
to
visit
or
wanderand
the
portuguese
were
the
only
foreigners
these
men
had
ever
seen
as
we
had
no
desire
to
pass
for
people
of
that
nationquite
the
contrarywe
usually
made
a
broad
line
of
demarcation
by
saying
that
we
were
english
and
the
english
neither
bought
sold
nor
held
black
people
as
slaves
but
wished
to
put
a
stop
to
the
slavetrade
altogether
we
called
upon
our
friend
mpende
in
passing
he
provided
a
hut
for
us
with
new
mats
spread
on
the
floor
having
told
him
that
we
were
hurrying
on
because
the
rains
were
near
are
they
near
eagerly
inquired
an
old
counsellor
and
are
we
to
have
plenty
of
rain
this
year
we
could
only
say
that
it
was
about
the
usual
time
for
the
rains
to
commence
and
that
there
were
the
usual
indications
in
great
abundance
of
clouds
floating
westwards
but
that
we
knew
nothing
more
than
they
did
themselves
the
hippopotami
are
more
wary
here
than
higher
up
as
the
natives
hunt
them
with
guns
having
shot
one
on
a
shallow
sandbank
our
men
undertook
to
bring
it
over
to
the
left
bank
in
order
to
cut
it
up
with
greater
ease
it
was
a
fine
fat
one
and
all
rejoiced
in
the
hope
of
eating
the
fat
for
butter
with
our
hard
dry
cakes
of
native
meal
our
cook
was
sent
over
to
cut
a
choice
piece
for
dinner
but
returned
with
the
astonishing
intelligence
that
the
carcass
was
gone
they
had
been
hoodwinked
and
were
very
much
ashamed
of
themselves
a
number
of
banyai
came
to
assist
in
rolling
it
ashore
and
asserted
that
it
was
all
shallow
water
they
rolled
it
over
and
over
towards
the
land
and
finding
the
rope
we
had
made
fast
to
it
as
they
said
an
encumbrance
it
was
unloosed
all
were
shouting
and
talking
as
loud
as
they
could
bawl
when
suddenly
our
expected
feast
plumped
into
a
deep
hole
as
the
banyai
intended
it
should
do
when
sinking
all
the
makololo
jumped
in
after
it
one
caught
frantically
at
the
tail
another
grasped
a
foot
a
third
seized
the
hip
but
by
sebituane
it
would
go
down
in
spite
of
all
that
we
could
do
instead
of
a
fat
hippopotamus
we
had
only
a
lean
fowl
for
dinner
and
were
glad
enough
to
get
even
that
the
hippopotamus
however
floated
during
the
night
and
was
found
about
a
mile
below
the
banyai
then
assembled
on
the
bank
and
disputed
our
right
to
the
beast
it
might
have
been
shot
by
somebody
else
our
men
took
a
little
of
it
and
then
left
it
rather
than
come
into
collision
with
them
a
fine
waterbuck
was
shot
in
the
kakolole
narrows
at
mount
manyerere
it
dropped
beside
the
creek
where
it
was
feeding
an
enormous
crocodile
that
had
been
watching
it
at
the
moment
seized
and
dragged
it
into
the
water
which
was
not
very
deep
the
mortally
wounded
animal
made
a
desperate
plunge
and
hauling
the
crocodile
several
yards
tore
itself
out
of
the
hideous
jaws
to
escape
the
hunter
the
waterbuck
jumped
into
the
river
and
was
swimming
across
when
another
crocodile
gave
chase
but
a
ball
soon
sent
it
to
the
bottom
the
waterbuck
swam
a
little
longer
the
fine
head
dropped
the
body
turned
over
and
one
of
the
canoes
dragged
it
ashore
below
kakolole
and
still
at
the
base
of
manyerere
mountain
several
coalseams
not
noticed
on
our
ascent
were
now
seen
to
crop
out
on
the
right
bank
of
the
zambesi
chitora
of
chicova
treated
us
with
his
former
hospitality
our
men
were
all
much
pleased
with
his
kindness
and
certainly
did
not
look
upon
it
as
a
proof
of
weakness
they
meant
to
return
his
friendliness
when
they
came
this
way
on
a
marauding
expedition
to
eat
the
sheep
of
the
banyai
for
insulting
them
in
the
affair
of
the
hippopotamus
they
would
then
send
word
to
chitora
not
to
run
away
for
they
being
his
friends
would
do
such
a
goodhearted
man
no
harm
we
entered
kebrabasa
rapids
at
the
east
end
of
chicova
in
the
canoes
and
went
down
a
number
of
miles
until
the
river
narrowed
into
a
groove
of
fifty
or
sixty
yards
wide
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
in
describing
the
floodbed
and
channel
of
low
water
the
navigation
then
became
difficult
and
dangerous
a
fifteen
feet
fall
of
the
water
in
our
absence
had
developed
many
cataracts
two
of
our
canoes
passed
safely
down
a
narrow
channel
which
bifurcating
had
an
ugly
whirlpool
at
the
rocky
partition
between
the
two
branches
the
deep
hole
in
the
whirls
at
times
opening
and
then
shutting
the
doctors
canoe
came
next
and
seemed
to
be
drifting
broadside
into
the
open
vortex
in
spite
of
the
utmost
exertions
of
the
paddlers
the
rest
were
expecting
to
have
to
pull
to
the
rescue
the
men
saying
look
where
these
people
are
goinglook
lookwhen
a
loud
crash
burst
on
our
ears
dr
kirks
canoe
was
dashed
on
a
projection
of
the
perpendicular
rocks
by
a
sudden
and
mysterious
boiling
up
of
the
river
which
occurs
at
irregular
intervals
dr
kirk
was
seen
resisting
the
suckingdown
action
of
the
water
which
must
have
been
fifteen
fathoms
deep
and
raising
himself
by
his
arms
on
to
the
ledge
while
his
steersman
holding
on
to
the
same
rocks
saved
the
canoe
but
nearly
all
its
contents
were
swept
away
down
the
stream
dr
livingstones
canoe
meanwhile
which
had
distracted
the
mens
attention
was
saved
by
the
cavity
in
the
whirlpool
filling
up
as
the
frightful
eddy
was
reached
a
few
of
the
things
in
dr
kirks
canoe
were
left
but
all
that
was
valuable
including
a
chronometer
a
barometer
and
to
our
great
sorrow
his
notes
of
the
journey
and
botanical
drawings
of
the
fruittrees
of
the
interior
perished
we
now
left
the
river
and
proceeded
on
foot
sorry
that
we
had
not
done
so
the
day
before
the
men
were
thoroughly
frightened
they
had
never
seen
such
perilous
navigation
they
would
carry
all
the
loads
rather
than
risk
kebrabasa
any
longer
but
the
fatigue
of
a
days
march
over
the
hot
rocks
and
burning
sand
changed
their
tune
before
night
and
then
they
regretted
having
left
the
canoes
they
thought
they
should
have
dragged
them
past
the
dangerous
places
and
then
launched
them
again
one
of
the
two
donkeys
died
from
exhaustion
near
the
luia
though
the
men
eat
zebras
and
quaggas
blood
relations
of
the
donkey
they
were
shocked
at
the
idea
of
eating
the
ass
it
would
be
like
eating
man
himself
because
the
donkey
lives
with
man
and
is
his
bosom
companion
we
met
two
large
trading
parties
of
tette
slaves
on
their
way
to
zumbo
leading
to
be
sold
for
ivory
a
number
of
manganja
women
with
ropes
round
their
necks
and
all
made
fast
to
one
long
rope
panzo
the
headman
of
the
village
east
of
kebrabasa
received
us
with
great
kindness
after
the
usual
salutation
he
went
up
the
hill
and
in
a
loud
voice
called
across
the
valley
to
the
women
of
several
hamlets
to
cook
supper
for
us
about
eight
in
the
evening
he
returned
followed
by
a
procession
of
women
bringing
the
food
there
were
eight
dishes
of
nsima
or
porridge
six
of
different
sorts
of
very
good
wild
vegetables
with
dishes
of
beans
and
fowls
all
deliciously
well
cooked
and
scrupulously
clean
the
wooden
dishes
were
nearly
as
white
as
the
meal
itself
food
also
was
brought
for
our
men
ripe
mangoes
which
usually
indicate
the
vicinity
of
the
portuguese
were
found
on
the
st
november
and
we
reached
tette
early
on
the
rd
having
been
absent
a
little
over
six
months
the
two
english
sailors
left
in
charge
of
the
steamer
were
well
had
behaved
well
and
had
enjoyed
excellent
health
all
the
time
we
were
away
their
farm
had
been
a
failure
we
left
a
few
sheep
to
be
slaughtered
when
they
wished
for
fresh
meat
and
two
dozen
fowls
purchasing
more
they
soon
had
double
the
number
of
the
latter
and
anticipated
a
good
supply
of
eggs
but
they
also
bought
two
monkeys
and
they
ate
all
the
eggs
a
hippopotamus
came
up
one
night
and
laid
waste
their
vegetable
garden
the
sheep
broke
into
their
cotton
patch
when
it
was
in
flower
and
ate
it
all
except
the
stems
then
the
crocodiles
carried
off
the
sheep
and
the
natives
stole
the
fowls
nor
were
they
more
successful
as
gunsmiths
a
portuguese
trader
having
an
exalted
opinion
of
the
ingenuity
of
english
sailors
showed
them
a
doublebarrelled
rifle
and
inquired
if
they
could
put
on
the
browning
which
had
rusted
off
i
think
i
knows
how
said
one
whose
father
was
a
blacksmith
its
very
easy
you
have
only
to
put
the
barrels
in
the
fire
a
great
fire
of
wood
was
made
on
shore
and
the
unlucky
barrels
put
over
it
to
secure
the
handsome
rifle
colour
to
jacks
utter
amazement
the
barrels
came
asunder
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
his
companion
and
he
stuck
the
pieces
together
with
resin
and
sent
it
to
the
owner
with
the
message
it
was
all
they
could
do
for
it
and
they
would
not
charge
him
anything
for
the
job
they
had
also
invented
an
original
mode
of
settling
a
bargain
having
ascertained
the
market
price
of
provisions
they
paid
that
but
no
more
if
the
traders
refused
to
leave
the
ship
till
the
price
was
increased
a
chameleon
of
which
the
natives
have
a
mortal
dread
was
brought
out
of
the
cabin
and
the
moment
the
natives
saw
the
creature
they
at
once
sprang
overboard
the
chameleon
settled
every
dispute
in
a
twinkling
but
besides
their
goodhumoured
intercourse
they
showed
humanity
worthy
of
english
sailors
a
terrible
scream
roused
them
up
one
night
and
they
pushed
off
in
a
boat
to
the
rescue
a
crocodile
had
caught
a
woman
and
was
dragging
her
across
a
shallow
sandbank
just
as
they
came
up
to
her
she
gave
a
fearful
shriek
the
horrid
reptile
had
snapped
off
her
leg
at
the
knee
they
took
her
on
board
bandaged
the
limb
as
well
as
they
could
and
not
thinking
of
any
better
way
of
showing
their
sympathy
gave
her
a
glass
of
rum
and
carried
her
to
a
hut
in
the
village
next
morning
they
found
the
bandages
torn
off
and
the
unfortunate
creature
left
to
die
i
believe
remarked
rowe
one
of
the
sailors
her
master
was
angry
with
us
for
saving
her
life
seeing
as
how
she
had
lost
her
leg
the
zambesi
being
unusually
low
we
remained
at
tette
till
it
rose
a
little
and
then
left
on
the
rd
of
december
for
the
kongone
it
was
hard
work
to
keep
the
vessel
afloat
indeed
we
never
expected
her
to
remain
above
water
new
leaks
broke
out
every
day
the
engine
pump
gave
way
the
bridge
broke
down
three
compartments
filled
at
night
except
the
cabin
and
front
compartment
all
was
flooded
and
in
a
few
days
we
were
assured
by
rowe
that
she
cant
be
worse
than
she
is
sir
he
and
hutchins
had
spent
much
of
their
time
while
we
were
away
in
patching
her
bottom
puddling
it
with
clay
and
shoring
it
and
it
was
chiefly
to
please
them
that
we
again
attempted
to
make
use
of
her
we
had
long
been
fully
convinced
that
the
steel
plates
were
thoroughly
unsuitable
on
the
morning
of
the
st
the
uncomfortable
asthmatic
grounded
on
a
sandbank
and
filled
she
could
neither
be
emptied
nor
got
off
the
river
rose
during
the
night
and
all
that
was
visible
of
the
wornout
craft
next
day
was
about
six
feet
of
her
two
masts
most
of
the
property
we
had
on
board
was
saved
and
we
spent
the
christmas
of
encamped
on
the
island
of
chimba
canoes
were
sent
for
from
senna
and
we
reached
it
on
the
th
to
be
again
hospitably
entertained
by
our
friend
senhor
ferrao
we
reached
the
kongone
on
the
th
of
january
a
flagstaff
and
a
customhouse
had
been
erected
during
our
absence
a
hut
also
for
a
black
lancecorporal
and
three
privates
by
the
kind
permission
of
the
lancecorporal
who
came
to
see
us
as
soon
as
he
had
got
into
his
trousers
and
shirt
we
took
up
our
quarters
in
the
customhouse
which
like
the
other
buildings
is
a
small
square
floorless
hut
of
mangrove
stakes
overlaid
with
reeds
the
soldiers
complained
of
hunger
they
had
nothing
to
eat
but
a
little
mapira
and
were
making
palm
wine
to
deaden
their
cravings
while
waiting
for
a
ship
we
had
leisure
to
read
the
newspapers
and
periodicals
we
found
in
the
mail
which
was
waiting
our
arrival
at
tette
several
were
a
year
and
a
half
old
our
provisions
began
to
run
short
and
towards
the
end
of
the
month
there
was
nothing
left
but
a
little
bad
biscuit
and
a
few
ounces
of
sugar
coffee
and
tea
were
expended
but
scarcely
missed
as
our
sailors
discovered
a
pretty
good
substitute
in
roasted
mapira
fresh
meat
was
obtained
in
abundance
from
our
antelope
preserves
on
the
large
island
made
by
a
creek
between
the
kongone
and
east
luabo
in
this
focus
of
decaying
vegetation
nothing
is
so
much
to
be
dreaded
as
inactivity
we
had
therefore
to
find
what
exercise
and
amusement
we
could
when
hunting
was
not
required
in
peering
about
in
the
fetid
swamps
to
have
gone
mooning
about
in
listless
idleness
would
have
ensured
fever
in
its
worst
form
and
probably
with
fatal
results
a
curious
little
blennyfish
swarms
in
the
numerous
creeks
which
intersect
the
mangrove
topes
when
alarmed
it
hurries
across
the
surface
of
the
water
in
a
series
of
leaps
it
may
be
considered
amphibious
as
it
lives
as
much
out
of
the
water
as
in
it
and
its
most
busy
time
is
during
low
water
then
it
appears
on
the
sand
or
mud
near
the
little
pools
left
by
the
retiring
tide
it
raises
itself
on
its
pectoral
fins
into
something
of
a
standing
attitude
and
with
its
large
projecting
eyes
keeps
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
lightcoloured
fly
on
which
it
feeds
should
the
fly
alight
at
too
great
a
distance
for
even
a
second
leap
the
blenny
moves
slowly
towards
it
like
a
cat
to
its
prey
or
like
a
jumping
spider
and
as
soon
as
it
gets
within
two
or
three
inches
of
the
insect
by
a
sudden
spring
contrives
to
pop
its
underset
mouth
directly
over
the
unlucky
victim
he
is
moreover
a
pugnacious
little
fellow
and
rather
prolonged
fights
may
be
observed
between
him
and
his
brethren
one
in
fleeing
from
an
apparent
danger
jumped
into
a
pool
a
foot
square
which
the
other
evidently
regarded
as
his
by
right
of
prior
discovery
in
a
twinkling
the
owner
with
eyes
flashing
fury
and
with
dorsal
fin
bristling
up
in
rage
dashed
at
the
intruding
foe
the
fight
waxed
furious
no
tempest
in
a
teapot
ever
equalled
the
storm
of
that
miniature
sea
the
warriors
were
now
in
the
water
and
anon
out
of
it
for
the
battle
raged
on
sea
and
shore
they
struck
hard
they
bit
each
other
until
becoming
exhausted
they
seized
each
other
by
the
jaws
like
two
bulldogs
then
paused
for
breath
and
at
it
again
as
fiercely
as
before
until
the
combat
ended
by
the
precipitate
retreat
of
the
invader
the
muddy
ground
under
the
mangrovetrees
is
covered
with
soldiercrabs
which
quickly
slink
into
their
holes
on
any
symptom
of
danger
when
the
ebbing
tide
retires
myriads
of
minute
crabs
emerge
from
their
underground
quarters
and
begin
to
work
like
so
many
busy
bees
soon
many
miles
of
the
smooth
sand
become
rough
with
the
results
of
their
labour
they
are
toiling
for
their
daily
bread
a
round
bit
of
moist
sand
appears
at
the
little
labourers
mouth
and
is
quickly
brushed
off
by
one
of
the
claws
a
second
bit
follows
the
first
and
another
and
still
another
come
as
fast
as
they
can
be
laid
aside
as
these
pellets
accumulate
the
crab
moves
sideways
and
the
work
continues
the
first
impression
one
receives
is
that
the
little
creature
has
swallowed
a
great
deal
of
sand
and
is
getting
rid
of
it
as
speedily
as
possible
a
habit
he
indulges
in
of
darting
into
his
hole
at
intervals
as
if
for
fresh
supplies
tends
to
strengthen
this
idea
but
the
size
of
the
heaps
formed
in
a
few
seconds
shows
that
this
cannot
be
the
case
and
leads
to
the
impression
that
although
not
readily
seen
at
the
distance
at
which
he
chooses
to
keep
the
observer
yet
that
possibly
he
raises
the
sand
to
his
mouth
where
whatever
animalcule
it
may
contain
is
sifted
out
of
it
and
the
remainder
rejected
in
the
manner
described
at
times
the
larger
species
of
crabs
perform
a
sort
of
concert
and
from
each
subterranean
abode
strange
sounds
arise
as
if
in
imitation
of
the
songsters
of
the
groves
for
very
joy
they
sang
we
found
some
natives
pounding
the
woody
stems
of
a
poisonous
climbing
plant
dirca
palustris
called
busungu
or
poison
which
grows
abundantly
in
the
swamps
when
a
good
quantity
was
bruised
it
was
tied
up
in
bundles
the
stream
above
and
below
was
obstructed
with
bushes
and
with
a
sort
of
rinsing
motion
the
poison
was
diffused
through
the
water
many
fish
were
soon
affected
swain
in
shore
and
died
others
were
only
stupefied
the
plant
has
pink
peashaped
blossoms
and
smooth
pointed
glossy
leaves
and
the
brown
bark
is
covered
with
minute
white
points
the
knowledge
of
it
might
prove
of
use
to
a
shipwrecked
party
by
enabling
them
to
catch
the
fish
the
poison
is
said
to
be
deleterious
to
man
if
the
water
is
drunk
but
not
when
the
fish
is
cooked
the
busungu
is
repulsive
to
some
insects
and
is
smeared
round
the
shoots
of
the
palmtrees
to
prevent
the
ants
from
getting
into
the
palm
wine
while
it
is
dropping
from
the
tops
of
the
palmtrees
into
the
little
pots
suspended
to
collect
it
we
were
in
the
habit
of
walking
from
our
beds
into
the
salt
water
at
sunrise
for
a
bath
till
a
large
crocodile
appeared
at
the
bathingplace
and
from
that
time
forth
we
took
our
dip
in
the
sea
away
from
the
harbour
about
midday
this
is
said
to
be
unwholesome
but
we
did
not
find
it
so
it
is
certainly
better
not
to
bathe
in
the
mornings
when
the
air
is
colder
than
the
waterfor
then
on
returning
to
the
cooler
air
one
is
apt
to
get
a
chill
and
fever
in
the
mouth
of
the
river
many
sawfish
are
found
rowe
saw
one
while
bathingcaught
it
by
the
tail
and
shoved
it
snout
on
ashore
the
saw
is
from
a
foot
to
eighteen
inches
long
we
never
heard
of
any
one
being
wounded
by
this
fish
nor
though
it
goes
hundreds
of
miles
up
the
river
in
fresh
water
could
we
learn
that
it
was
eaten
by
the
people
the
hippopotami
delighted
to
spend
the
day
among
the
breakers
and
seemed
to
enjoy
the
fun
as
much
as
we
did
severe
gales
occurred
during
our
stay
on
the
coast
and
many
small
sea
birds
prion
banksii
smith
perished
the
beach
was
strewn
with
their
dead
bodies
and
some
were
found
hundreds
of
yards
inland
many
were
so
emaciated
as
to
dry
up
without
putrefying
we
were
plagued
with
myriads
of
mosquitoes
and
had
some
touches
of
fever
the
men
we
brought
from
malarious
regions
of
the
interior
suffered
almost
as
much
from
it
here
as
we
did
ourselves
this
gives
strength
to
the
idea
that
the
civilized
withstand
the
evil
influences
of
strange
climates
better
than
the
uncivilized
when
negroes
return
to
their
own
country
from
healthy
lands
they
suffer
as
severely
as
foreigners
ever
do
on
the
st
of
january
our
new
ship
the
pioneer
arrived
from
england
and
anchored
outside
the
bar
but
the
weather
was
stormy
and
she
did
not
venture
in
till
the
th
of
february
two
of
hm
cruisers
came
at
the
same
time
bringing
bishop
mackenzie
and
the
oxford
and
cambridge
mission
to
the
tribes
of
the
shire
and
lake
nyassa
the
mission
consisted
of
six
englishmen
and
five
coloured
men
from
the
cape
it
was
a
puzzle
to
know
what
to
do
with
so
many
men
the
estimable
bishop
anxious
to
commence
his
work
without
delay
wished
the
pioneer
to
carry
the
mission
up
the
shire
as
far
as
chibisas
and
there
leave
them
but
there
were
grave
objections
to
this
the
pioneer
was
under
orders
to
explore
the
rovuma
as
the
portuguese
government
had
refused
to
open
the
zambesi
to
the
ships
of
other
nations
and
their
officials
were
very
effectually
pursuing
a
system
which
by
abstracting
the
labour
was
rendering
the
country
of
no
value
either
to
foreigners
or
to
themselves
she
was
already
two
months
behind
her
time
and
the
rainy
season
was
half
over
then
if
the
party
were
taken
to
chibisas
the
mission
would
he
left
without
a
medical
attendant
in
an
unhealthy
region
at
the
beginning
of
the
most
sickly
season
of
the
year
and
without
means
of
reaching
the
healthy
highlands
or
of
returning
to
the
sea
we
dreaded
that
in
the
absence
of
medical
aid
and
all
knowledge
of
the
treatment
of
fever
there
might
be
a
repetition
of
the
sorrowful
fate
which
befell
the
similar
nonmedical
mission
at
linyanti
on
the
th
of
february
the
pioneer
anchored
in
the
mouth
of
the
rovuma
which
unlike
most
african
rivers
has
a
magnificent
bay
and
no
bar
we
wooded
and
then
waited
for
the
bishop
till
the
th
of
march
when
he
came
in
the
lyra
on
the
th
we
proceeded
up
the
river
and
saw
that
it
had
fallen
four
or
five
feet
during
our
detention
the
scenery
on
the
lower
part
of
the
rovuma
is
superior
to
that
on
the
zambesi
for
we
can
see
the
highlands
from
the
sea
eight
miles
from
the
mouth
the
mangroves
are
left
behind
and
a
beautiful
range
of
wellwooded
hills
on
each
bank
begins
on
these
ridges
the
tree
resembling
african
blackwood
of
finer
grain
than
ebony
grows
abundantly
and
attains
a
large
size
few
people
were
seen
and
those
were
of
arab
breed
and
did
not
appear
to
be
very
well
off
the
current
of
the
rovuma
was
now
as
strong
as
that
of
the
zambesi
but
the
volume
of
water
is
very
much
less
several
of
the
crossings
had
barely
water
enough
for
our
ship
drawing
five
feet
to
pass
when
we
were
thirty
miles
up
the
river
the
water
fell
suddenly
seven
inches
in
twentyfour
hours
as
the
march
flood
is
the
last
of
the
season
and
it
appeared
to
be
expended
it
was
thought
prudent
to
avoid
the
chance
of
a
years
detention
by
getting
the
ship
back
to
the
sea
without
delay
had
the
expedition
been
alone
we
would
have
pushed
up
in
boats
or
afoot
and
done
what
we
could
towards
the
exploration
of
the
river
and
upper
end
of
the
lake
but
though
the
mission
was
a
private
one
and
entirely
distinct
from
our
own
a
public
one
the
objects
of
both
being
similar
we
felt
anxious
to
aid
our
countrymen
in
their
noble
enterprise
and
rather
than
follow
our
own
inclination
decided
to
return
to
the
shire
see
the
mission
party
settled
safely
and
afterwards
explore
lake
nyassa
and
the
rovuma
from
the
lake
downwards
fever
broke
out
on
board
the
pioneer
at
the
mouth
of
the
rovuma
as
we
thought
from
our
having
anchored
close
to
a
creek
coming
out
of
the
mangroves
and
it
remained
in
her
until
we
completely
isolated
the
engineroom
from
the
rest
of
the
ship
the
coaldust
rotting
sent
out
strong
effluvia
and
kept
up
the
disease
for
more
than
a
twelvemonth
soon
after
we
started
the
fever
put
the
pioneer
almost
entirely
into
the
hands
of
the
original
zambesi
expedition
and
not
long
afterwards
the
leader
had
to
navigate
the
ocean
as
well
as
the
river
the
habit
of
finding
the
geographical
positions
on
land
renders
it
an
easy
task
to
steer
a
steamer
with
only
three
or
four
sails
at
sea
where
if
one
does
not
run
ashore
no
one
follows
to
find
out
an
error
and
where
a
current
affords
a
ready
excuse
for
every
blunder
touching
at
mohilla
one
of
the
comoro
islands
on
our
return
we
found
a
mixed
race
of
arabs
africans
and
their
conquerors
the
natives
of
madagascar
being
mahometans
they
have
mosques
and
schools
in
which
we
were
pleased
to
see
girls
as
well
as
boys
taught
to
read
the
koran
the
teacher
said
he
was
paid
by
the
job
and
received
ten
dollars
for
teaching
each
child
to
read
the
clever
ones
learn
in
six
months
but
the
dull
ones
take
a
couple
of
years
we
next
went
over
to
johanna
for
our
friends
and
after
a
sojourn
of
a
few
days
at
the
beautiful
comoro
islands
we
sailed
for
the
kongone
mouth
of
the
zambesi
with
bishop
mackenzie
and
his
party
we
reached
the
coast
in
seven
days
and
passed
up
the
zambesi
to
the
shire
the
pioneer
constructed
under
the
skilful
supervision
of
admiral
sir
baldwin
walker
and
the
late
admiral
washington
warmhearted
and
highly
esteemed
friends
of
the
expedition
was
a
very
superior
vessel
and
well
suited
for
our
work
in
every
respect
except
in
her
draught
of
water
five
feet
were
found
to
be
too
much
for
the
navigation
of
the
upper
part
of
the
shire
designed
to
draw
three
feet
only
the
weight
necessary
to
impart
extra
strength
and
fit
her
for
the
ocean
brought
her
down
two
feet
more
and
caused
us
a
great
deal
of
hard
and
vexatious
work
in
laying
out
anchors
and
toiling
at
the
capstan
to
get
her
off
sandbanks
we
should
not
have
minded
this
much
but
for
the
heavy
loss
of
time
which
might
have
been
more
profitably
and
infinitely
more
pleasantly
spent
in
intercourse
with
the
people
exploring
new
regions
and
otherwise
carrying
out
the
objects
of
the
expedition
once
we
were
a
fortnight
on
a
bank
of
soft
yielding
sand
having
only
two
or
three
inches
less
water
than
the
ship
drew
this
delay
was
occasioned
by
the
anchors
coming
home
and
the
current
swinging
the
ship
broadside
on
the
bank
which
immediately
on
our
touching
always
formed
behind
us
we
did
not
like
to
leave
the
ship
short
of
chibisas
lest
the
crew
should
suffer
from
the
malaria
of
the
lowland
around
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
have
got
the
mission
goods
carried
up
we
were
daily
visited
by
crowds
of
natives
who
brought
us
abundance
of
provisions
far
beyond
our
ability
to
consume
in
hauling
the
pioneer
over
the
shallow
places
the
bishop
with
horace
waller
and
mr
scudamore
were
ever
ready
and
anxious
to
lend
a
hand
and
worked
as
hard
as
any
on
board
had
our
fine
little
ship
drawn
but
three
feet
she
could
have
run
up
and
down
the
river
at
any
time
of
the
year
with
the
greatest
ease
but
as
it
was
having
once
passed
up
over
a
few
shallow
banks
it
was
impossible
to
take
her
down
again
until
the
river
rose
in
december
she
could
go
up
over
a
bank
but
not
come
down
over
it
as
a
heap
of
sand
always
formed
instantly
astern
while
the
current
washed
it
away
from
under
her
bows
on
at
last
reaching
chibisas
we
heard
that
there
was
war
in
the
manganja
country
and
the
slavetrade
was
going
on
briskly
a
deputation
from
a
chief
near
mount
zomba
had
just
passed
on
its
way
to
chibisa
who
was
in
a
distant
village
to
implore
him
to
come
himself
or
send
medicine
to
drive
off
the
waiao
waiau
or
ajawa
whose
marauding
parties
were
desolating
the
land
a
large
gang
of
recently
enslaved
manganja
crossed
the
river
on
their
way
to
tette
a
few
days
before
we
got
the
ship
up
chibisas
deputy
was
civil
and
readily
gave
us
permission
to
hire
as
many
men
to
carry
the
bishops
goods
up
to
the
hills
as
were
willing
to
go
with
a
sufficient
number
therefore
we
started
for
the
highlands
on
the
th
of
july
to
show
the
bishop
the
country
which
from
its
altitude
and
coolness
was
most
suitable
for
a
station
our
first
days
march
was
a
long
and
fatiguing
one
the
few
hamlets
we
passed
were
poor
and
had
no
food
for
our
men
and
we
were
obliged
to
go
on
till
pm
when
we
entered
the
small
village
of
chipindu
the
inhabitants
complained
of
hunger
and
said
they
had
no
food
to
sell
and
no
hut
for
us
to
sleep
in
but
if
we
would
only
go
on
a
little
further
we
should
come
to
a
village
where
they
had
plenty
to
eat
but
we
had
travelled
far
enough
and
determined
to
remain
where
we
were
before
sunset
as
much
food
was
brought
as
we
cared
to
purchase
and
as
it
threatened
to
rain
huts
were
provided
for
the
whole
party
next
forenoon
we
halted
at
the
village
of
our
old
friend
mbame
to
obtain
new
carriers
because
chibisas
men
never
before
having
been
hired
and
not
having
yet
learned
to
trust
us
did
not
choose
to
go
further
after
resting
a
little
mbame
told
us
that
a
slave
party
on
its
way
to
tette
would
presently
pass
through
his
village
shall
we
interfere
we
inquired
of
each
other
we
remembered
that
all
our
valuable
private
baggage
was
in
tette
which
if
we
freed
the
slaves
might
together
with
some
government
property
be
destroyed
in
retaliation
but
this
system
of
slavehunters
dogging
us
where
previously
they
durst
not
venture
and
on
pretence
of
being
our
children
setting
one
tribe
against
another
to
furnish
themselves
with
slaves
would
so
inevitably
thwart
all
the
efforts
for
which
we
had
the
sanction
of
the
portuguese
government
that
we
resolved
to
run
all
risks
and
put
a
stop
if
possible
to
the
slave
trade
which
had
now
followed
on
the
footsteps
of
our
discoveries
a
few
minutes
after
mbame
had
spoken
to
us
the
slave
party
a
long
line
of
manacled
men
women
and
children
came
wending
their
way
round
the
hill
and
into
the
valley
on
the
side
of
which
the
village
stood
the
black
drivers
armed
with
muskets
and
bedecked
with
various
articles
of
finery
marched
jauntily
in
the
front
middle
and
rear
of
the
line
some
of
them
blowing
exultant
notes
out
of
long
tin
horns
they
seemed
to
feel
that
they
were
doing
a
very
noble
thing
and
might
proudly
march
with
an
air
of
triumph
but
the
instant
the
fellows
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
english
they
darted
off
like
mad
into
the
forest
so
fast
indeed
that
we
caught
but
a
glimpse
of
their
red
caps
and
the
soles
of
their
feet
the
chief
of
the
party
alone
remained
and
he
from
being
in
front
had
his
hand
tightly
grasped
by
a
makololo
he
proved
to
be
a
wellknown
slave
of
the
late
commandant
at
tette
and
for
some
time
our
own
attendant
while
there
on
asking
him
how
he
obtained
these
captives
he
replied
he
had
bought
them
but
on
our
inquiring
of
the
people
themselves
all
save
four
said
they
had
been
captured
in
war
while
this
inquiry
was
going
on
he
bolted
too
the
captives
knelt
down
and
in
their
way
of
expressing
thanks
clapped
their
hands
with
great
energy
they
were
thus
left
entirely
on
our
hands
and
knives
were
soon
busy
at
work
cutting
the
women
and
children
loose
it
was
more
difficult
to
cut
the
men
adrift
as
each
had
his
neck
in
the
fork
of
a
stout
stick
six
or
seven
feet
long
and
was
kept
in
by
an
iron
rod
which
was
riveted
at
both
ends
across
the
throat
with
a
saw
luckily
in
the
bishops
baggage
one
by
one
the
men
were
sawn
out
into
freedom
the
women
on
being
told
to
take
the
meal
they
were
carrying
and
cook
breakfast
for
themselves
and
the
children
seemed
to
consider
the
news
too
good
to
be
true
but
after
a
little
coaxing
went
at
it
with
alacrity
and
made
a
capital
fire
by
which
to
boil
their
pots
with
the
slave
sticks
and
bonds
their
old
acquaintances
through
many
a
sad
night
and
weary
day
many
were
mere
children
about
five
years
of
age
and
under
one
little
boy
with
the
simplicity
of
childhood
said
to
our
men
the
others
tied
and
starved
us
you
cut
the
ropes
and
tell
us
to
eat
what
sort
of
people
are
youwhere
did
you
come
from
two
of
the
women
had
been
shot
the
day
before
for
attempting
to
untie
the
thongs
this
the
rest
were
told
was
to
prevent
them
from
attempting
to
escape
one
woman
had
her
infants
brains
knocked
out
because
she
could
not
carry
her
load
and
it
and
a
man
was
dispatched
with
an
axe
because
he
had
broken
down
with
fatigue
selfinterest
would
have
set
a
watch
over
the
whole
rather
than
commit
murder
but
in
this
traffic
we
invariably
find
selfinterest
overcome
by
contempt
of
human
life
and
by
bloodthirstiness
the
bishop
was
not
present
at
this
scene
having
gone
to
bathe
in
a
little
stream
below
the
village
but
on
his
return
he
warmly
approved
of
what
had
been
done
he
at
first
had
doubts
but
now
felt
that
had
he
been
present
he
would
have
joined
us
in
the
good
work
logic
is
out
of
place
when
the
question
with
a
truehearted
man
is
whether
his
brother
man
is
to
be
saved
or
not
eightyfour
chiefly
women
and
children
were
liberated
and
on
being
told
that
they
were
now
free
and
might
go
where
they
pleased
or
remain
with
us
they
all
chose
to
stay
and
the
bishop
wisely
attached
them
to
his
mission
to
be
educated
as
members
of
a
christian
family
in
this
way
a
great
difficulty
in
the
commencement
of
a
mission
was
overcome
years
are
usually
required
before
confidence
is
so
far
instilled
into
the
natives
mind
as
to
induce
them
young
or
old
to
submit
to
the
guidance
of
strangers
professing
to
be
actuated
by
motives
the
reverse
of
worldly
wisdom
and
inculcating
customs
strange
and
unknown
to
them
and
their
fathers
we
proceeded
next
morning
to
soches
with
our
liberated
party
the
men
cheerfully
carrying
the
bishops
goods
as
we
had
begun
it
was
of
no
use
to
do
things
by
halves
so
eight
others
were
freed
in
a
hamlet
on
our
path
but
a
party
of
traders
with
nearly
a
hundred
slaves
fled
from
soches
on
hearing
of
our
proceedings
dr
kirk
and
four
makololo
followed
them
with
great
energy
but
they
made
clear
off
to
tette
six
more
captives
were
liberated
at
mongazis
and
two
slavetraders
detained
for
the
night
to
prevent
them
from
carrying
information
to
a
large
party
still
in
front
of
their
own
accord
they
volunteered
the
information
that
the
governors
servants
had
charge
of
the
next
party
but
we
did
not
choose
to
be
led
by
them
though
they
offered
to
guide
us
to
his
excellencys
own
agents
two
of
the
bishops
black
men
from
the
cape
having
once
been
slaves
were
now
zealous
emancipators
and
volunteered
to
guard
the
prisoners
during
the
night
so
anxious
were
our
heroes
to
keep
them
safe
that
instead
of
relieving
each
other
by
keeping
watch
and
watch
both
kept
watch
together
till
towards
four
oclock
in
the
morning
when
sleep
stole
gently
over
them
both
and
the
wakeful
prisoners
seizing
the
opportunity
escaped
one
of
the
guards
perceiving
the
loss
rushed
out
of
the
hut
shouting
they
are
gone
the
prisoners
are
off
and
they
have
taken
my
rifle
with
them
and
the
women
too
fire
everybody
fire
the
rifle
and
the
women
however
were
all
safe
enough
the
slavetraders
being
only
too
glad
to
escape
alone
fifty
more
slaves
were
freed
next
day
in
another
village
and
the
whole
party
being
starknaked
cloth
enough
was
left
to
clothe
them
better
probably
than
they
had
ever
been
clothed
before
the
head
of
this
gang
whom
we
knew
as
the
agent
of
one
of
the
principal
merchants
of
tette
said
that
they
had
the
license
of
the
governor
for
all
they
did
this
we
were
fully
aware
of
without
his
stating
it
it
is
quite
impossible
for
any
enterprise
to
be
undertaken
there
without
the
governors
knowledge
and
connivance
the
portion
of
the
highlands
which
the
bishop
wished
to
look
at
before
deciding
on
a
settlement
belonged
to
chiwawa
or
chibaba
the
most
manly
and
generous
manganja
chief
we
had
met
with
on
our
previous
journey
on
reaching
nsambos
near
mount
chiradzuru
we
heard
that
chibaba
was
dead
and
that
chigunda
was
chief
instead
chigunda
apparently
of
his
own
accord
though
possibly
he
may
have
learnt
that
the
bishop
intended
to
settle
somewhere
in
the
country
asked
him
to
come
and
live
with
him
at
magomero
adding
that
there
was
room
enough
for
both
this
hearty
and
spontaneous
invitation
had
considerable
influence
on
the
bishops
mind
and
seemed
to
decide
the
question
a
place
nearer
the
shire
would
have
been
chosen
had
he
expected
his
supplies
to
come
up
that
river
but
the
portuguese
claiming
the
river
shire
though
never
occupying
even
its
mouth
had
closed
it
as
well
as
the
zambesi
our
hopes
were
turned
to
the
rovuma
as
a
free
highway
into
lake
nyassa
and
the
vast
interior
a
steamer
was
already
ordered
for
the
lake
and
the
bishop
seeing
the
advantageous
nature
of
the
highlands
which
stretch
an
immense
way
to
the
north
was
more
anxious
to
be
near
the
lake
and
the
rovuma
than
the
shire
when
he
decided
to
settle
at
magomero
it
was
thought
desirable
to
prevent
the
country
from
being
depopulated
to
visit
the
ajawa
chief
and
to
try
and
persuade
him
to
give
up
his
slaving
and
kidnapping
courses
and
turn
the
energies
of
his
people
to
peaceful
pursuits
on
the
morning
of
the
nd
we
were
informed
that
the
ajawa
were
near
and
were
burning
a
village
a
few
miles
off
leaving
the
rescued
slaves
we
moved
off
to
seek
an
interview
with
these
scourges
of
the
country
on
our
way
we
met
crowds
of
manganja
fleeing
from
the
war
in
front
these
poor
fugitives
from
the
slave
hunt
had
as
usual
to
leave
all
the
food
they
possessed
except
the
little
they
could
carry
on
their
heads
we
passed
field
after
field
of
indian
corn
or
beans
standing
ripe
for
harvesting
but
the
owners
were
away
the
villages
were
all
deserted
one
where
we
breakfasted
two
years
before
and
saw
a
number
of
men
peacefully
weaving
cloth
and
among
ourselves
called
it
the
paisley
of
the
hills
was
burnt
the
stores
of
corn
were
poured
out
in
cartloads
and
scattered
all
over
the
plain
and
all
along
the
paths
neither
conquerors
nor
conquered
having
been
able
to
convey
it
away
about
two
oclock
we
saw
the
smoke
of
burning
villages
and
heard
triumphant
shouts
mingled
with
the
wail
of
the
manganja
women
lamenting
over
their
slain
the
bishop
then
engaged
us
in
fervent
prayer
and
on
rising
from
our
knees
we
saw
a
long
line
of
ajawa
warriors
with
their
captives
coming
round
the
hillside
the
first
of
the
returning
conquerors
were
entering
their
own
village
below
and
we
heard
women
welcoming
them
back
with
lillilooings
the
ajawa
headman
left
the
path
on
seeing
us
and
stood
on
an
anthill
to
obtain
a
complete
view
of
our
party
we
called
out
that
we
had
come
to
have
an
interview
with
them
but
some
of
the
manganja
who
followed
us
shouted
our
chibisa
is
come
chibisa
being
well
known
as
a
great
conjurer
and
general
the
ajawa
ran
off
yelling
and
screaming
nkondo
nkondo
war
war
we
heard
the
words
of
the
manganja
but
they
did
not
strike
us
at
the
moment
as
neutralizing
all
our
assertions
of
peace
the
captives
threw
down
their
loads
on
the
path
and
fled
to
the
hills
and
a
large
body
of
armed
men
came
running
up
from
the
village
and
in
a
few
seconds
they
were
all
around
us
though
mostly
concealed
by
the
projecting
rocks
and
long
grass
in
vain
we
protested
that
we
had
not
come
to
fight
but
to
talk
with
them
they
would
not
listen
having
as
we
remembered
afterwards
good
reason
in
the
cry
of
our
chibisa
flushed
with
recent
victory
over
three
villages
and
confident
of
an
easy
triumph
over
a
mere
handful
of
men
they
began
to
shoot
their
poisoned
arrows
sending
them
with
great
force
upwards
of
a
hundred
yards
and
wounding
one
of
our
followers
through
the
arm
our
retiring
slowly
up
the
ascent
from
the
village
only
made
them
more
eager
to
prevent
our
escape
and
in
the
belief
that
this
retreat
was
evidence
of
fear
they
closed
upon
us
in
bloodthirsty
fury
some
came
within
fifty
yards
dancing
hideously
others
having
quite
surrounded
us
and
availing
themselves
of
the
rocks
and
long
grass
hard
by
were
intent
on
cutting
us
off
while
others
made
off
with
their
women
and
a
large
body
of
slaves
four
were
armed
with
muskets
and
we
were
obliged
in
selfdefence
to
return
their
fire
and
drive
them
off
when
they
saw
the
range
of
rifles
they
very
soon
desisted
and
ran
away
but
some
shouted
to
us
from
the
hills
the
consoling
intimation
that
they
would
follow
and
kill
us
where
we
slept
only
two
of
the
captives
escaped
to
us
but
probably
most
of
those
made
prisoners
that
day
fled
elsewhere
in
the
confusion
we
returned
to
the
village
which
we
had
left
in
the
morning
after
a
hungry
fatiguing
and
most
unpleasant
day
though
we
could
not
blame
ourselves
for
the
course
we
had
followed
we
felt
sorry
for
what
had
happened
it
was
the
first
time
we
had
ever
been
attacked
by
the
natives
or
come
into
collision
with
them
though
we
had
always
taken
it
for
granted
that
we
might
be
called
upon
to
act
in
self
defence
we
were
on
this
occasion
less
prepared
than
usual
no
game
having
been
expected
here
the
men
had
only
a
single
round
of
cartridge
each
their
leader
had
no
revolver
and
the
rifle
he
usually
fired
with
was
left
at
the
ship
to
save
it
from
the
damp
of
the
season
had
we
known
better
the
effect
of
slavery
and
murder
on
the
temper
of
these
bloodthirsty
marauders
we
should
have
tried
messages
and
presents
before
going
near
them
the
old
chief
chinsunse
came
on
a
visit
to
us
next
day
and
pressed
the
bishop
to
come
and
live
with
him
chigunda
he
said
is
but
a
child
and
the
bishop
ought
to
live
with
the
father
rather
than
with
the
child
but
the
old
mans
object
was
so
evidently
to
have
the
mission
as
a
shield
against
the
ajawa
that
his
invitation
was
declined
while
begging
us
to
drive
away
the
marauders
that
he
might
live
in
peace
he
adopted
the
stratagem
of
causing
a
number
of
his
men
to
rush
into
the
village
in
breathless
haste
with
the
news
that
the
ajawa
were
close
upon
us
and
having
been
reminded
that
we
never
fought
unless
attacked
as
we
were
the
day
before
and
that
we
had
come
among
them
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
peace
and
of
teaching
them
to
worship
the
supreme
to
give
up
selling
his
children
and
to
cultivate
other
objects
for
barter
than
each
other
he
replied
in
a
huff
then
i
am
dead
already
the
bishop
feeling
as
most
englishmen
would
at
the
prospect
of
the
people
now
in
his
charge
being
swept
off
into
slavery
by
hordes
of
men
stealers
proposed
to
go
at
once
to
the
rescue
of
the
captive
manganja
and
drive
the
marauding
ajawa
out
of
the
country
all
were
warmly
in
favour
of
this
save
dr
livingstone
who
opposed
it
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
bishop
to
wait
and
see
the
effect
of
the
check
the
slavehunters
had
just
experienced
the
ajawa
were
evidently
goaded
on
by
portuguese
agents
from
tette
and
there
was
no
bond
of
union
among
the
manganja
on
which
to
work
it
was
possible
that
the
ajawa
might
be
persuaded
to
something
better
though
from
having
long
been
in
the
habit
of
slaving
for
the
quillimane
market
it
was
not
very
probable
but
the
manganja
could
easily
be
overcome
piecemeal
by
any
enemy
old
feuds
made
them
glad
to
see
calamities
befall
their
next
neighbours
we
counselled
them
to
unite
against
the
common
enemies
of
their
country
and
added
distinctly
that
we
english
would
on
no
account
enter
into
their
quarrels
on
the
bishop
inquiring
whether
in
the
event
of
the
manganja
again
asking
aid
against
the
ajawa
it
would
be
his
duty
to
accede
to
their
requestno
replied
dr
livingstone
you
will
be
oppressed
by
their
importunities
but
do
not
interfere
in
native
quarrels
this
advice
the
good
man
honourably
mentions
in
his
journal
we
have
been
rather
minute
in
relating
what
occurred
during
the
few
days
of
our
connection
with
the
mission
of
the
english
universities
on
the
hills
because
the
recorded
advice
having
been
discarded
blame
was
thrown
on
dr
livingstones
shoulders
as
if
the
missionaries
had
no
individual
responsibility
for
their
subsequent
conduct
this
unquestionably
good
bishop
mackenzie
had
too
much
manliness
to
have
allowed
the
connection
of
the
members
of
the
zambesi
expedition
with
the
acts
of
the
bishops
mission
now
ceased
for
we
returned
to
the
ship
and
prepared
for
our
journey
to
lake
nyassa
we
cheerfully
if
necessary
will
bear
all
responsibility
up
to
this
point
and
if
the
bishop
afterwards
made
mistakes
in
certain
collisions
with
the
slavers
he
had
the
votes
of
all
his
party
with
him
and
those
who
best
knew
the
peculiar
circumstances
and
the
loving
disposition
of
this
goodhearted
man
will
blame
him
least
in
this
position
and
in
these
circumstances
we
left
our
friends
at
the
mission
station
as
a
temporary
measure
the
bishop
decided
to
place
his
mission
station
on
a
small
promontory
formed
by
the
windings
of
the
little
clear
stream
of
magomero
which
was
so
cold
that
the
limbs
were
quite
benumbed
by
washing
in
it
in
the
july
mornings
the
site
chosen
was
a
pleasant
spot
to
the
eye
and
completely
surrounded
by
stately
shady
trees
it
was
expected
to
serve
for
a
residence
till
the
bishop
had
acquired
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
adjacent
country
and
of
the
political
relations
of
the
people
and
could
select
a
healthy
and
commanding
situation
as
a
permanent
centre
of
christian
civilization
everything
promised
fairly
the
weather
was
delightful
resembling
the
pleasantest
part
of
an
english
summer
provisions
poured
in
very
cheap
and
in
great
abundance
the
bishop
with
characteristic
ardour
commenced
learning
the
language
mr
waller
began
building
and
mr
scudamore
improvised
a
sort
of
infant
school
for
the
children
than
which
there
is
no
better
means
for
acquiring
an
unwritten
tongue
on
the
th
of
august
a
few
days
after
returning
from
magomero
drs
livingstone
and
kirk
and
charles
livingstone
started
for
nyassa
with
a
light
fouroared
gig
a
white
sailor
and
a
score
of
attendants
we
hired
people
along
the
path
to
carry
the
boat
past
the
forty
miles
of
the
murchison
cataracts
for
a
cubit
of
cotton
cloth
a
day
this
being
deemed
great
wages
more
than
twice
the
men
required
eagerly
offered
their
services
the
chief
difficulty
was
in
limiting
their
numbers
crowds
followed
us
and
had
we
not
taken
down
in
the
morning
the
names
of
the
porters
engaged
in
the
evening
claims
would
have
been
made
by
those
who
only
helped
during
the
last
ten
minutes
of
the
journey
the
men
of
one
village
carried
the
boat
to
the
next
and
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
tell
the
headman
that
we
wanted
fresh
men
in
the
morning
he
saw
us
pay
the
first
party
and
had
his
men
ready
at
the
time
appointed
so
there
was
no
delay
in
waiting
for
carriers
they
often
make
a
loud
noise
when
carrying
heavy
loads
but
talking
and
bawling
does
not
put
them
out
of
breath
the
country
was
rough
and
with
little
soil
on
it
but
covered
with
grass
and
open
forest
a
few
small
trees
were
cut
down
to
clear
a
path
for
our
shouting
assistants
who
were
good
enough
to
consider
the
boat
as
a
certificate
of
peaceful
intentions
at
least
to
them
several
small
streams
were
passed
the
largest
of
which
were
the
mukurumadse
and
lesungwe
the
inhabitants
on
both
banks
were
now
civil
and
obliging
our
possession
of
a
boat
and
consequent
power
of
crossing
independently
of
the
canoes
helped
to
develop
their
good
manners
which
were
not
apparent
on
our
previous
visit
there
is
often
a
surprising
contrast
between
neighbouring
villages
one
is
well
off
and
thriving
having
good
huts
plenty
of
food
and
native
cloth
and
its
people
are
frank
trusty
generous
and
eager
to
sell
provisions
while
in
the
next
the
inhabitants
may
be
illhoused
disobliging
suspicious
illfed
and
scantily
clad
and
with
nothing
for
sale
though
the
land
around
is
as
fertile
as
that
of
their
wealthier
neighbours
we
followed
the
river
for
the
most
part
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
still
reaches
for
sailing
but
a
comparatively
smooth
country
lies
further
inland
over
which
a
good
road
could
be
made
some
of
the
five
main
cataracts
are
very
grand
the
river
falling
feet
in
the
miles
after
passing
the
last
of
the
cataracts
we
launched
our
boat
for
good
on
the
broad
and
deep
waters
of
the
upper
shire
and
were
virtually
on
the
lake
for
the
gentle
current
shows
but
little
difference
of
level
the
bed
is
broad
and
deep
but
the
course
is
rather
tortuous
at
first
and
makes
a
long
bend
to
the
east
till
it
comes
within
five
or
six
miles
of
the
base
of
mount
zomba
the
natives
regarded
the
upper
shire
as
a
prolongation
of
lake
nyassa
for
where
what
we
called
the
river
approaches
lake
shirwa
a
little
north
of
the
mountains
they
said
that
the
hippopotami
which
are
great
night
travellers
pass
from
one
lake
into
the
other
there
the
land
is
flat
and
only
a
short
land
journey
would
be
necessary
seldom
does
the
current
here
exceed
a
knot
an
hour
while
that
of
the
lower
shire
is
from
two
to
twoandahalf
knots
our
land
party
of
makololo
accompanied
us
along
the
right
bank
and
passed
thousands
of
manganja
fugitives
living
in
temporary
huts
on
that
side
who
had
recently
been
driven
from
their
villages
on
the
opposite
hills
by
the
ajawa
the
soil
was
dry
and
hard
and
covered
with
mopanetrees
but
some
of
the
manganja
were
busy
hoeing
the
ground
and
planting
the
little
corn
they
had
brought
with
them
the
effects
of
hunger
were
already
visible
on
those
whose
food
had
been
seized
or
burned
by
the
ajawa
and
portuguese
slavetraders
the
spokesman
or
prime
minister
of
one
of
the
chiefs
named
kalonjere
was
a
humpbacked
dwarf
a
fluent
speaker
who
tried
hard
to
make
us
go
over
and
drive
off
the
ajawa
but
he
could
not
deny
that
by
selling
people
kalonjere
had
invited
these
slavehunters
to
the
country
this
is
the
second
humpbacked
dwarf
we
have
found
occupying
the
like
important
post
the
other
was
the
prime
minister
of
a
batonga
chief
on
the
zambesi
as
we
sailed
along
we
disturbed
many
whitebreasted
cormorants
we
had
seen
the
same
species
fishing
between
the
cataracts
here
with
many
other
wildfowls
they
find
subsistence
on
the
smooth
water
by
night
and
sit
sleepily
on
trees
and
in
the
reeds
by
day
many
hippopotami
were
seen
in
the
river
and
one
of
them
stretched
its
wide
jaws
as
if
to
swallow
the
whole
stern
of
the
boat
close
to
dr
kirks
back
the
animal
was
so
near
that
in
opening
its
mouth
it
lashed
a
quantity
of
water
on
to
the
sternsheets
but
did
no
damage
to
avoid
large
marauding
parties
of
ajawa
on
the
left
bank
of
the
shire
we
continued
on
the
right
or
western
side
with
our
land
party
along
the
shore
of
the
small
lake
pamalombe
this
lakelet
is
ten
or
twelve
miles
in
length
and
five
or
six
broad
it
is
nearly
surrounded
by
a
broad
belt
of
papyrus
so
dense
that
we
could
scarcely
find
an
opening
to
the
shore
the
plants
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
grew
so
closely
together
that
air
was
excluded
and
so
much
sulphuretted
hydrogen
gas
evolved
that
by
one
nights
exposure
the
bottom
of
the
boat
was
blackened
myriads
of
mosquitoes
showed
as
probably
they
always
do
the
presence
of
malaria
we
hastened
from
this
sickly
spot
trying
to
take
the
attentions
of
the
mosquitoes
as
hints
to
seek
more
pleasant
quarters
on
the
healthy
shores
of
lake
nyassa
and
when
we
sailed
into
it
on
the
nd
september
we
felt
refreshed
by
the
greater
coolness
of
the
air
off
this
large
body
of
water
the
depth
was
the
first
point
of
interest
this
is
indicated
by
the
colour
of
the
water
which
on
a
belt
along
the
shore
varying
from
a
quarter
to
half
a
mile
in
breadth
is
light
green
and
this
is
met
by
the
deep
blue
or
indigo
tint
of
the
indian
ocean
which
is
the
colour
of
the
great
body
of
nyassa
we
found
the
upper
shire
from
nine
to
fifteen
feet
in
depth
but
skirting
the
western
side
of
the
lake
about
a
mile
from
the
shore
the
water
deepened
from
nine
to
fifteen
fathoms
then
as
we
rounded
the
grand
mountainous
promontory
which
we
named
cape
maclear
after
our
excellent
friend
the
astronomer
royal
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
we
could
get
no
bottom
with
our
leadline
of
thirtyfive
fathoms
we
pulled
along
the
western
shore
which
was
a
succession
of
bays
and
found
that
where
the
bottom
was
sandy
near
the
beach
and
to
a
mile
out
the
depth
varied
from
six
to
fourteen
fathoms
in
a
rocky
bay
about
latitude
degrees
minutes
we
had
soundings
at
fathoms
though
outside
the
same
bay
we
found
none
with
a
fishingline
of
fathoms
but
this
cast
was
unsatisfactory
as
the
line
broke
in
coming
up
according
to
our
present
knowledge
a
ship
could
anchor
only
near
the
shore
looking
back
to
the
southern
end
of
lake
nyassa
the
arm
from
which
the
shire
flows
was
found
to
be
about
thirty
miles
long
and
from
ten
to
twelve
broad
rounding
cape
maclear
and
looking
to
the
southwest
we
have
another
arm
which
stretches
some
eighteen
miles
southward
and
is
from
six
to
twelve
miles
in
breadth
these
arms
give
the
southern
end
a
forked
appearance
and
with
the
help
of
a
little
imagination
it
may
be
likened
to
the
bootshape
of
italy
the
narrowest
part
is
about
the
ankle
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
from
this
it
widens
to
the
north
and
in
the
upper
third
or
fourth
it
is
fifty
or
sixty
miles
broad
the
length
is
over
miles
the
direction
in
which
it
lies
is
as
near
as
possible
due
north
and
south
nothing
of
the
great
bend
to
the
west
shown
in
all
the
previous
maps
could
be
detected
by
either
compass
or
chronometer
and
the
watch
we
used
was
an
excellent
one
the
season
of
the
year
was
very
unfavourable
the
smokes
filled
the
air
with
an
impenetrable
haze
and
the
equinoctial
gales
made
it
impossible
for
us
to
cross
to
the
eastern
side
when
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
rising
from
behind
the
mountains
to
the
east
we
made
sketches
and
bearings
of
them
at
different
latitudes
which
enabled
us
to
secure
approximate
measurements
of
the
width
these
agreed
with
the
times
taken
by
the
natives
at
the
different
crossingplacesas
tsenga
and
molamba
about
the
beginning
of
the
upper
third
the
lake
is
crossed
by
taking
advantage
of
the
island
chizumara
which
name
in
the
native
tongue
means
the
ending
further
north
they
go
round
the
end
instead
though
that
takes
several
days
the
lake
appeared
to
be
surrounded
by
mountains
but
it
was
afterwards
found
that
these
beautiful
treecovered
heights
were
on
the
west
only
the
edges
of
high
tablelands
like
all
narrow
seas
encircled
by
highlands
it
is
visited
by
sudden
and
tremendous
storms
we
were
on
it
in
september
and
october
perhaps
the
stormiest
season
of
the
year
and
were
repeatedly
detained
by
gales
at
times
while
sailing
pleasantly
over
the
blue
water
with
a
gentle
breeze
suddenly
and
without
any
warning
was
heard
the
sound
of
a
coming
storm
roaring
on
with
crowds
of
angry
waves
in
its
wake
we
were
caught
one
morning
with
the
sea
breaking
all
around
us
and
unable
either
to
advance
or
recede
anchored
a
mile
from
shore
in
seven
fathoms
the
furious
surf
on
the
beach
would
have
shivered
our
boat
to
atoms
had
we
tried
to
land
the
waves
most
dreaded
came
rolling
on
in
threes
with
their
crests
driven
into
spray
streaming
behind
them
a
short
lull
followed
each
triple
charge
had
one
of
these
seas
struck
our
boat
nothing
could
have
saved
us
for
they
came
on
with
resistless
force
seaward
in
shore
and
on
either
side
of
us
they
broke
in
foam
but
we
escaped
for
six
weary
hours
we
faced
those
terrible
trios
a
low
dark
detached
oddly
shaped
cloud
came
slowly
from
the
mountains
and
hung
for
hours
directly
over
our
heads
a
flock
of
nightjars
cometornis
vexillarius
which
on
no
other
occasion
come
out
by
day
soared
above
us
in
the
gale
like
birds
of
evil
omen
our
black
crew
became
seasick
and
unable
to
sit
up
or
keep
the
boats
head
to
the
sea
the
natives
and
our
land
party
stood
on
the
high
cliffs
looking
at
us
and
exclaiming
as
the
waves
seemed
to
swallow
up
the
boat
they
are
lost
they
are
all
dead
when
at
last
the
gale
moderated
and
we
got
safely
ashore
they
saluted
us
warmly
as
after
a
long
absence
from
this
time
we
trusted
implicitly
to
the
opinions
of
our
seaman
john
neil
who
having
been
a
fisherman
on
the
coast
of
ireland
understood
boating
on
a
stormy
coast
and
by
his
advice
we
often
sat
cowering
on
the
land
for
days
together
waiting
for
the
surf
to
go
down
he
had
never
seen
such
waves
before
we
had
to
beach
the
boat
every
night
to
save
her
from
being
swamped
at
anchor
and
did
we
not
believe
the
gales
to
be
peculiar
to
one
season
of
the
year
would

the

distinct

that
for
some
time
during
the
rainy
season
the
water
of
the
lake
is
three
feet
above
the
point
to
which
it
falls
towards
the
close
of
the
dry
period
of
the
year
the
rains
begin
here
in
november
and
the
permanent
rise
of
the
shire
does
not
take
place
till
january
the
western
side
of
lake
nyassa
with
the
exception
of
the
great
harbour
to
the
west
of
cape
maclear
is
as
has
been
said
before
a
succession
of
small
bays
of
nearly
similar
form
each
having
an
open
sandy
beach
and
pebbly
shore
and
being
separated
from
its
neighbour
by
a
rocky
headland
with
detached
rocks
extending
some
distance
out
to
sea
the
great
southwestern
bay
referred
to
would
form
a
magnificent
harbour
the
only
really
good
one
we
saw
to
the
west
the
land
immediately
adjacent
to
the
lake
is
low
and
fertile
though
in
some
places
marshy
and
tenanted
by
large
flocks
of
ducks
geese
herons
crowned
cranes
and
other
birds
in
the
southern
parts
we
have
sometimes
ten
or
a
dozen
miles
of
rich
plains
bordered
by
what
seem
high
ranges
of
wellwooded
hills
running
nearly
parallel
with
the
lake
northwards
the
mountains
become
loftier
and
present
some
magnificent
views

towering
beyond
range
until
the
dim
lofty
outlines
projected
against
the
sky
bound
the
prospect
still
further
north
the
plain
becomes
more
narrow
until
near
where
we
turned
it
disappears
altogether
and
the
mountains
rise
abruptly
out
of
the
lake
forming
the
northeast
boundary
of
what
was
described
to
us
as
an
extensive
tableland
well
suited
for
pasturage
and
agriculture
and
now
only
partially
occupied
by
a
tribe
of
zulus
who
came
from

have
we
seen
anything
like
the
dense
population
on
the
shores
of
lake
nyassa
in
the
southern
part
there
was
an
almost
unbroken
chain
of
villages
on
the
beach
of
wellnigh
of
every
little
sandy
bay
dark
crowds
were
standing
gazing
at
the
novel
sight
of
a
boat
under
sail
and
wherever
we
landed
we
were
surrounded
in
a
few
seconds
by
hundreds
of
men
women
and
children
who
hastened
to
have
a
stare
at
the
chirombo
wild
animals
during
a
portion
of
the
year
the
northern
dwellers
on
the
lake
have
a
harvest
which
furnishes
a
singular
sort
of
food
as
we
approached
our
limit
in
that
direction
clouds
as
of
smoke
rising
from
miles
of
burning
grass
were
observed
bending
in
a
southeasterly
direction
and
we
thought
that
the
unseen
land
on
the
opposite
side
was
closing
in
and
that
we
were
near
the
end
of
the
lake
but
next
morning
we
sailed
through
one
of
the
clouds
on
our
own
side
and
discovered
that
it
was
neither
smoke
nor
haze
but
countless
millions
of
minute
midges
called
kungo
a
cloud
or
fog
they
filled
the
air
to
an
immense
height
and
swarmed
upon
the
water

light
to
sink
in
it

had
to
be
kept

while
passing
through
this

struck
upon
the
face
like
fine
drifting
snow
thousands
lay
in
the

when

emerged
from
the
cloud

large
as
the

was
offered

us
it
was
very
dark

by

running
up
the
rivers
to

have
ever
eaten
in
africa
they
were
ascending
the
rivers
in
august
and
september
and
furnished
active
and
profitable
employment
to
many
fishermen
who
did
not
mind
their
being
out
of
season
weirs
were
constructed
full
of
sluices
in
each
of
which
was
set
a
large
baskettrap
through
whose
single
tortuous
opening
the
fish
once
in
has
but
small
chance
of
escape
a
short
distance
below
the
weir
nets
are
stretched
across
from
bank
to
bank
so
that
it
seemed
a
marvel
how
the
most
sagacious
sanjika
could
get
up
at
all
without
being
taken
possibly
a
passage
up
the
river
is
found
at
night
but
this
is
not
the
country
of
sundays
or
close
times
for
either
men
or
fish
the
lake
fish
are
caught
chiefly
in
nets
although
men
and
even
women
with
babies
on
their
backs
are
occasionally
seen
fishing
from
the
rocks
with
hooks
a
net
with
small
meshes
is
used
for
catching
the
young
fry
of
a
silvery
kind
like
pickerel
when
they
are
about
two
inches
long
thousands
are
often
taken
in
a
single
haul
we
had
a
present
of
a
large
bucketful
one
day
for
dinner
they
tasted
as
if
they
had
been
cooked
with
a
little
quinine
probably
from
their
gallbladders
being
left
in
in
deep
water
some
sorts
are
taken
by
lowering
fishbaskets
attached
by
a
long
cord
to
a
float
around
which
is
often
tied
a
mass
of
grass
or
weeds
as
an
alluring
shade
for
the
deepsea
fish
fleets
of
fine
canoes
are
engaged
in
the
fisheries
the
men
have
long
paddles
and
stand
erect
while
using
them
they
sometimes
venture
out
when
a
considerable
sea
is
running
our
makololo
acknowledge
that
in
handling
canoes
the
lake
men
beat
them
they
were
unwilling
to
cross
the
zambesi
even
when
the
wind
blew
fresh
though
there
are
many
crocodiles
in
the
lake
and
some
of
an
extraordinary
size
the
fishermen
say
that
it
is
a
rare
thing
for
any
one
to
be
carried
off
by
these
reptiles
when
crocodiles
can
easily
obtain
abundance
of
fishtheir
natural
foodthey
seldom
attack
men
but
when
unable
to
see
to
catch
their
prey
from
the
muddiness
of
the
water
in
floods
they
are
very
dangerous
many
men
and
boys
are
employed
in
gathering
the
buaze
in
preparing
the
fibre
and
in
making
it
into
long
nets
the
knot
of
the
net
is
different
from
ours
for
they
invariably
use
what
sailors
call
the
reef
knot
but
they
net
with
a
needle
like
that
we
use
from
the
amount
of
native
cotton
cloth
worn
in
many
of
the
southern
villages
it
is
evident
that
a
great
number
of
hands
and
heads
must
be
employed
in
the
cultivation
of
cotton
and
in
the
various
slow
processes
through
which
it
has
to
pass
before
the
web
is
finished
in
the
native
loom
in
addition
to
this
branch
of
industry
an
extensive
manufacture
of
cloth
from
the
inner
bark
of
an
undescribed
tree
of
the
botanical
group
caesalpineae
is
ever
going
on
from
one
end
of
the
lake
to
the
other
and
both
toil
and
time
are
required
to
procure
the
bark
and
to
prepare
it
by
pounding
and
steeping
it
to
render
it
soft
and
pliable
the
prodigious
amount
of
the
bark
clothing
worn
indicates
the
destruction
of
an
immense
number
of
trees
every
year
yet
the
adjacent
heights
seem
still
well
covered
with
timber
the
lake
people
are
by
no
means
handsome
the
women
are
very
plain
and
really
make
themselves
hideous
by
the
means
they
adopt
to
render
themselves
attractive
the
pelele
or
ornament
for
the
upper
lip
is
universally
worn
by
the
ladies
the
most
valuable
is
of
pure
tin
hammered
into
the
shape
of
a
small
dish
some
are
made
of
white
quartz
and
give
the
wearer
the
appearance
of
having
an
inch
or
more
of
one
of
prices
patent
candles
thrust
through
the
lip
and
projecting
beyond
the
tip
of
the
nose
in
character
the
lake
tribes
are
very
much
like
other
people
there
are
decent
men
among
them
while
a
good
many
are
no
better
than
they
should
be
they
are
openhanded
enough
if
one
of
us
as
was
often
the
case
went
to
see
a
net
drawn
a
fish
was
always
offered
sailing
one
day
past
a
number
of
men
who
had
just
dragged
their
nets
ashore
at
one
of
the
fine
fisheries
at
pamalombe
we
were
hailed
and
asked
to
stop
and
received
a
liberal
donation
of
beautiful
fish
arriving
late
one
afternoon
at
a
small
village
on
the
lake
a
number
of
the
inhabitants
manned
two
canoes
took
out
their
seine
dragged
it
and
made
us
a
present
of
the
entire
haul
the
northern
chief
marenga
a
tall
handsome
man
with
a
fine
aquiline
nose
whom
we
found
living
in
his
stockade
in
a
forest
about
twenty
miles
north
of
the
mountain
kowirwe
behaved
like
a
gentleman
to
us
his
land
extended
from
dambo
to
the
north
of
makuza
hill
he
was
specially
generous
and
gave
us
bountiful
presents
of
food
and
beer
do
they
wear
such
things
in
your
country
he
asked
pointing
to
his
iron
bracelet
which
was
studded
with
copper
and
highly
prized
the
doctor
said
he
had
never
seen
such
in
his
country
whereupon
marenga
instantly
took
it
off
and
presented
it
to
him
and
his
wife
also
did
the
same
with
hers
on
our
return
south
from
the
mountains
near
the
north
end
of
the
lake
we
reached
marengas
on
the
th
october
when
he
could
not
prevail
upon
us
to
forego
the
advantage
of
a
fair
wind
for
his
invitation
to
spend
the
whole
day
drinking
his
beer
which
was
he
said
quite
ready
he
loaded
us
with
provisions
all
of
which
he
sent
for
before
we
gave
him
any
present
in
allusion
to
the
boats
sail
his
people
said
that
they
had
no
bazimo
or
none
worth
having
seeing
they
had
never
invented
the
like
for
them
the
chief
mankambira
likewise
treated
us
with
kindness
but
wherever
the
slavetrade
is
carried
on
the
people
are
dishonest
and
uncivil
that
invariably
leaves
a
blight
and
a
curse
in
its
path
the
first
question
put
to
us
at
the
lake
crossing
places
was
have
you
come
to
buy
slaves
on
hearing
that
we
were
english
and
never
purchased
slaves
the
questioners
put
on
a
supercilious
air
and
sometimes
refused
to
sell
us
food
this
want
of
respect
to
us
may
have
been
owing
to
the
impressions
conveyed
to
them
by
the
arabs
whose
dhows
have
sometimes
been
taken
by
english
cruisers
when
engaged
in
lawful
trade
much
foreign
cloth
beads
and
brasswire
were
worn
by
these
ferrymenand
some
had
muskets
by
chitanda
near
one
of
the
slave
crossingplaces
we
were
robbed
for
the
first
time
in
africa
and
learned
by
experience
that
these
people
like
more
civilized
nations
have
expert
thieves
among
them
it
might
be
only
a
coincidence
but
we
never
suffered
from
impudence
loss
of
property
or
were
endangered
unless
among
people
familiar
with
slaving
we
had
such
a
general
sense
of
security
that
never
save
when
we
suspected
treachery
did
we
set
a
watch
at
night
our
native
companions
had
on
this
occasion
been
carousing
on
beer
and
had
removed
to
a
distance
of
some
thirty
yards
that
we
might
not
overhear
their
free
and
easy
afterdinner
remarks
and
two
of
us
had
a
slight
touch
of
fever
between
three
and
four
oclock
in
the
morning
some
thieves
came
while
we
slept
ingloriouslyrifles
and
revolvers
all
readyand
relieved
us
of
most
of
our
goods
the
boats
sail
under
which
we
slept
was
open
all
around
so
the
feat
was
easy
awaking
as
honest
men
do
at
the
usual
hour
the
loss
of
one
was
announced
by
my
bag
is
gonewith
all
my
clothes
and
my
boots
too
and
mine
responded
a
second
and
mine
also
chimed
in
the
third
with
the
bag
of
beads
and
the
rice
is
the
cloth
taken
was
the
eager
inquiry
as
that
would
have
been
equivalent
to
all
our
money
it
had
been
used
for
a
pillow
that
night
and
thus
saved
the
rogues
left
on
the
beach
close
to
our
beds
the
aneroid
barometer
and
a
pair
of
boots
thinking
possibly
that
they
might
be
of
use
to
us
or
at
least
that
they
could
be
of
none
to
them
they
shoved
back
some
dried
plants
and
fishes
into
one
bag
but
carried
off
many
other
specimens
we
had
collected
some
of
our
notes
also
and
nearly
all
our
clothing
we
could
not
suspect
the
people
of
the
village
near
which
we
lay
we
had
probably
been
followed
for
days
by
the
thieves
watching
for
an
opportunity
and
our
suspicions
fell
on
some
persons
who
had
come
from
the
east
coast
but
having
no
evidence
and
expecting
to
hear
if
our
goods
were
exposed
for
sale
in
the
vicinity
we
made
no
fuss
about
it
and
began
to
make
new
clothing
that
our
rifles
and
revolvers
were
left
untouched
was
greatly
to
our
advantage
yet
we
felt
it
was
most
humiliating
for
armed
men
to
have
been
so
thoroughly
fleeced
by
a
few
black
rascals
some
of
the
best
fisheries
appear
to
be
private
property
we
found
shelter
from
a
storm
one
morning
in
a
spacious
lagoon
which
communicated
with
the
lake
by
a
narrow
passage
across
this
strait
stakes
were
driven
in
leaving
only
spaces
for
the
basket
fishtraps
a
score
of
men
were
busily
engaged
in
taking
out
the
fish
we
tried
to
purchase
some
but
they
refused
to
sell
the
fish
did
not
belong
to
them
they
would
send
for
the
proprietor
of
the
place
the
proprietor
arrived
in
a
short
time
and
readily
sold
what
we
wanted
some
of
the
buryinggrounds
are
very
well
arranged
and
well
cared
for
this
was
noticed
at
chitanda
and
more
particularly
at
a
village
on
the
southern
shore
of
the
fine
harbour
at
cape
maclear
wide
and
neat
paths
were
made
in
the
buryingground
on
its
eastern
and
southern
sides
a
grand
old
figtree
stood
at
the
northeast
corner
and
its
widespreading
branches
threw
their
kindly
shade
over
the
last
restingplace
of
the
dead
several
other
magnificent
trees
grew
around
the
hallowed
spot
mounds
were
raised
as
they
are
at
home
but
all
lay
north
and
south
the
heads
apparently
north
the
graves
of
the
sexes
were
distinguished
by
the
various
implements
which
the
buried
dead
had
used
in
their
different
employments
during
life
but
they
were
all
broken
as
if
to
be
employed
no
more
a
piece
of
fishingnet
and
a
broken
paddle
told
where
a
fisherman
lay
the
graves
of
the
women
had
the
wooden
mortar
and
the
heavy
pestle
used
in
pounding
the
corn
and
the
basket
in
which
the
meal
is
sifted
while
all
had
numerous
broken
calabashes
and
pots
arranged
around
them
the
idea
that
the
future
life
is
like
the
present
does
not
appear
to
prevail
yet
a
bananatree
had
been
carefully
planted
at
the
head
of
several
of
the
graves
the
fruit
might
be
considered
an
offering
to
those
who
still
possess
human
tastes
the
people
of
the
neighbouring
villages
were
friendly
and
obliging
and
willingly
brought
us
food
for
sale
pursuing
our
exploration
we
found
that
the
northern
part
of
the
lake
was
the
abode
of
lawlessness
and
bloodshed
the
mazite
or
mazitu
live
on
the
highlands
and
make
sudden
swoops
on
the
villages
of
the
plains
they
are
zulus
who
came
originally
from
the
south
inland
of
sofalla
and
inhambane
and
are
of
the
same
family
as
those
who
levy
annual
tribute
from
the
portuguese
on
the
zambesi
all
the
villages
north
of
mankambiras
lat
degrees
minutes
south
had
been
recently
destroyed
by
these
terrible
marauders
but
they
were
foiled
in
their
attacks
upon
that
chief
and
marenga
the
thickets
and
stockades
round
their
villages
enabled
the
bowmen
to
pick
off
the
mazitu
in
security
while
they
were
afraid
to
venture
near
any
place
where
they
could
not
use
their
shields
beyond
mankambiras
we
saw
burned
villages
and
the
putrid
bodies
of
many
who
had
fallen
by
mazitu
spears
only
a
few
days
before
our
land
party
were
afraid
to
go
further
this
reluctance
to
proceed
without
the
presence
of
a
white
man
was
very
natural
because
bands
of
the
enemy
who
had
ravaged
the
country
were
supposed
to
be
still
roaming
about
and
if
these
marauders
saw
none
but
men
of
their
own
colour
our
party
might
forthwith
be
attacked
compliance
with
their
request
led
to
an
event
which
might
have
been
attended
by
very
serious
consequences
dr
livingstone
got
separated
from
the
party
in
the
boat
for
four
days
having
taken
the
first
mornings
journey
along
with
them
and
directing
the
boat
to
call
for
him
in
a
bay
in
sight
both
parties
proceeded
north
in
an
hour
dr
livingstone
and
his
party
struck
inland
on
approaching
the
foot
of
the
mountains
which
rise
abruptly
from
the
lake
supposing
that
they
had
heard
of
a
path
behind
the
high
range
which
there
forms
the
shore
those
in
the
boat
held
on
their
course
but
it
soon
began
to
blow
so
fresh
that
they
had
to
run
ashore
for
safety
while
delayed
a
couple
of
hours
two
men
were
sent
up
the
hills
to
look
for
the
land
party
but
they
could
see
nothing
of
them
and
the
boat
party
sailed
as
soon
as
it
was
safe
to
put
to
sea
with
the
conviction
that
the
missing
ones
would
regain
the
lake
in
front
in
a
short
time
a
small
island
or
mass
of
rocks
was
passed
on
which
were
a
number
of
armed
mazitu
with
some
young
women
apparently
their
wives
the
headman
said
that
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
foot
by
mankambira
and
that
they
were
staying
there
till
he
could
walk
to
his
chief
who
lived
over
the
hills
they
had
several
large
canoes
and
it
was
evident
that
this
was
a
nest
of
lake
pirates
who
sallied
out
by
night
to
kill
and
plunder
they
reported
a
path
behind
the
hills
and
the
crew
being
reassured
the
boat
sailed
on
a
few
miles
further
another
and
still
larger
band
of
pirates
were
fallen
in
with
and
hundreds
of
crows
and
kites
hovered
over
and
round
the
rocks
on
which
they
lived
dr
kirk
and
charles
livingstone
though
ordered
in
a
voice
of
authority
to
come
ashore
kept
on
their
course
a
number
of
canoes
then
shot
out
from
the
rocks
and
chased
them
one
with
nine
strong
paddlers
persevered
for
some
time
after
all
the
others
gave
up
the
chase
a
good
breeze
however
enabled
the
gig
to
get
away
from
them
with
ease
after
sailing
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
north
of
the
point
where
dr
livingstone
had
left
them
it
was
decided
that
he
must
be
behind
but
no
sooner
had
the
boats
head
been
turned
south
than
another
gale
compelled
her
to
seek
shelter
in
a
bay
here
a
number
of
wretched
fugitives
from
the
slavetrade
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
lake
were
found
the
original
inhabitants
of
the
place
had
all
been
swept
off
the
year
before
by
the
mazitu
in
the
deserted
gardens
beautiful
cotton
was
seen
growing
much
of
it
had
the
staple
an
inch
and
a
half
long
and
of
very
fine
quality
some
of
the
plants
were
uncommonly
large
deserving
to
be
ranked
with
trees
on
their
trying
to
purchase
food
the
natives
had
nothing
to
sell
except
a
little
dried
cassavaroot
and
a
few
fish
and
they
demanded
two
yards
of
calico
for
the
head
only
of
a
large
fish
when
the
gale
admitted
of
their
return
their
former
pursuers
tried
to
draw
them
ashore
by
asserting
that
they
had
quantities
of
ivory
for
sale
owing
to
a
succession
of
gales
it
was
the
fourth
day
from
parting
that
the
boat
was
found
by
dr
livingstone
who
was
coming
on
in
search
of
it
with
only
two
of
his
companions
after
proceeding
a
short
distance
up
the
path
in
which
they
had
been
lost
sight
of
they
learned
that
it
would
take
several
days
to
go
round
the
mountains
and
rejoin
the
lake
and
they
therefore
turned
down
to
the
bay
expecting
to
find
the
boat
but
only
saw
it
disappearing
away
to
the
north
they
pushed
on
as
briskly
as
possible
after
it
but
the
mountain
flank
which
forms
the
coast
proved
excessively
tedious
and
fatiguing
travelling
all
day
the
distance
made
in
a
straight
line
was
under
five
miles
as
soon
as
day
dawned
the
march
was
resumed
and
after
hearing
at
the
first
inhabited
rock
that
their
companions
had
passed
it
the
day
before
a
goat
was
slaughtered
out
of
the
four
which
they
had
with
them
when
suddenly
to
the
evident
consternation
of
the
men
seven
mazitu
appeared
armed
with
spears
and
shields
with
their
heads
dressed
fantastically
with
feathers
to
hold
a
parley
dr
livingstone
and
moloka
a
makololo
man
who
spoke
zulu
went
unarmed
to
meet
them
on
dr
livingstone
approaching
them
they
ordered
him
to
stop
and
sit
down
in
the
sun
while
they
sat
in
the
shade
no
no
was
the
reply
if
you
sit
in
the
shade
so
will
we
they
then
rattled
their
shields
with
their
clubs
a
proceeding
which
usually
inspires
terror
but
moloka
remarked
it
is
not
the
first
time
we
have
heard
shields
rattled
and
all
sat
down
together
they
asked
for
a
present
to
show
their
chief
that
they
had
actually
met
strangerssomething
as
evidence
of
having
seen
men
who
were
not
arabs
and
they
were
requested
in
turn
to
take
these
strangers
to
the
boat
or
to
their
chief
all
the
goods
were
in
the
boat
and
to
show
that
no
present
such
as
they
wanted
was
in
his
pockets
dr
livingstone
emptied
them
turning
out
among
other
things
a
notebook
thinking
it
was
a
pistol
they
started
up
and
said
put
that
in
again
the
younger
men
then
became
boisterous
and
demanded
a
goat
that
could
not
be
spared
as
they
were
the
sole
provisions
when
they
insisted
they
were
asked
how
many
of
the
party
they
had
killed
that
they
thus
began
to
divide
the
spoil
this
evidently
made
them
ashamed
the
elders
were
more
reasonable
they
dreaded
treachery
and
were
as
much
afraid
of
dr
livingstone
and
his
party
as
his
men
were
of
them
for
on
leaving
they
sped
away
up
the
hills
like
frightened
deer
one
of
them
and
probably
the
leader
was
married
as
seen
by
portions
of
his
hair
sewn
into
a
ring
all
were
observed
by
their
teeth
to
be
people
of
the
country
who
had
been
incorporated
into
the
zulu
tribe
the
way
still
led
over
a
succession
of
steep
ridges
with
ravines
of
from
to
feet
in
depth
some
of
the
sides
had
to
be
scaled
on
hands
and
knees
and
no
sooner
was
the
top
reached
than
the
descent
began
again
each
ravine
had
a
running
stream
and
the
whole
country
though
so
very
rugged
had
all
been
cultivated
and
densely
peopled
many
bananatrees
uncared
for
patches
of
corn
and
congobean
bushes
attested
former
cultivation
the
population
had
all
been
swept
away
ruined
villages
broken
utensils
and
human
skeletons
met
with
at
every
turn
told
a
sad
tale
so
numerous
were
the
slain
that
it
was
thought
the
inhabitants
had
been
slaughtered
in
consequence
of
having
made
raids
on
the
zulus
for
cattle
continuing
the
journey
that
night
as
long
as
light
served
they
slept
unconsciously
on
the
edge
of
a
deep
precipice
without
fire
lest
the
mazitu
should
see
it
next
morning
most
of
the
men
were
tired
out
the
dread
of
the
apparition
of
the
day
before
tending
probably
to
increase
the
lameness
of
which
they
complained
when
told
however
that
all
might
return
to
mankambiras
save
two
moloka
and
charlie
they
would
not
till
assured
that
the
act
would
not
be
considered
one
of
cowardice
giving
them
one
of
the
goats
as
provision
another
was
slaughtered
for
the
remainder
of
the
party
who
having
found
on
the
rocks
a
canoe
which
had
belonged
to
one
of
the
deserted
villages
determined
to
put
to
sea
again
but
the
craft
was
very
small
and
the
remaining
goat
spite
of
many
a
threat
of
having
its
throat
cut
jumped
and
rolled
about
so
as
nearly
to
capsize
it
so
dr
livingstone
took
to
the
shore
again
and
after
another
night
spent
without
fire
except
just
for
cooking
was
delighted
to
see
the
boat
coming
back
we
pulled
that
day
to
mankambiras
a
distance
that
on
shore
with
the
most
heartbreaking
toil
had
taken
three
days
to
travel
this
was
the
last
latitude
taken
degrees
minutes
s
the
boat
had
gone
about
minutes
further
to
the
north
the
land
party
probably
half
that
distance
but
fever
prevented
the
instruments
being
used
dr
kirk
and
charles
livingstone
were
therefore
furthest
up
the
lake
and
they
saw
about
minutes
beyond
their
turningpoint
say
into
the
tenth
degree
of
south
latitude
from
the
heights
of
at
least
a
thousand
feet
over
which
the
land
party
toiled
the
dark
mountain
masses
on
both
sides
of
the
lake
were
seen
closing
in
at
this
elevation
the
view
extended
at
least
as
far
as
that
from
the
boats
and
it
is
believed
the
end
of
the
lake
lies
on
the
southern
borders
of
degrees
or
the
northern
limits
of
degrees
south
latitude
elephants
are
numerous
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
and
surprisingly
tame
being
often
found
close
to
the
villages
hippopotami
swarm
very
much
at
their
ease
in
the
creeks
and
lagoons
and
herds
are
sometimes
seen
in
the
lake
itself
their
tameness
arises
from
the
fact
that
poisoned
arrows
have
no
effect
on
either
elephant
or
hippopotamus
five
of
each
were
shot
for
food
during
our
journey
two
of
the
elephants
were
females
and
had
only
a
single
tusk
apiece
and
were
each
killed
by
the
first
shot
it
is
always
a
case
of
famine
or
satiety
when
depending
on
the
rifle
for
fooda
glut
of
meat
or
none
at
all
most
frequently
it
is
scanty
fare
except
when
game
is
abundant
as
it
is
far
up
the
zambesi
we
had
one
morning
two
hippopotami
and
an
elephant
perhaps
in
all
some
eight
tons
of
meat
and
two
days
after
the
last
of
a
few
sardines
only
for
dinner
one
morning
when
sailing
past
a
pretty
thicklyinhabited
part
we
were
surprised
at
seeing
nine
large
bullelephants
standing
near
the
beach
quietly
flapping
their
gigantic
ears
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
getting
some
fresh
meat
we
landed
and
fired
into
one
they
all
retreated
into
a
marshy
piece
of
ground
between
two
villages
our
men
gave
chase
and
fired
into
the
herd
standing
on
a
sand
hummock
we
could
see
the
bleeding
animals
throwing
showers
of
water
with
their
trunks
over
their
backs
the
herd
was
soon
driven
back
upon
us
and
a
wounded
one
turned
to
bay
yet
neither
this
one
nor
any
of
the
others
ever
attempted
to
charge
having
broken
his
legs
with
a
rifleball
we
fired
into
him
at
forty
yards
as
rapidly
as
we
could
load
and
discharge
the
rifles
he
simply
shook
his
head
at
each
shot
and
received
at
least
sixty
enfield
balls
before
he
fell
our
excellent
sailor
from
the
north
of
ireland
happened
to
fire
the
last
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
animal
fall
he
turned
with
an
air
of
triumph
to
the
doctor
and
exclaimed
it
was
my
shot
that
done
it
sir
in
a
few
minutes
upwards
of
a
thousand
natives
were
round
the
prostrate
king
of
beasts
and
after
our
men
had
taken
all
they
wanted
an
invitation
was
given
to
the
villagers
to
take
the
remainder
they
rushed
at
it
like
hungry
hyenas
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
every
inch
of
it
was
carried
off
it
was
only
by
knowing
that
the
meat
would
all
be
used
that
we
felt
justified
in
the
slaughter
of
this
noble
creature
the
tusks
weighed
lbs
each
a
large
amount
of
ivory
might
be
obtained
from
the
people
of
nyassa
and
we
were
frequently
told
of
their
having
it
in
their
huts
while
detained
by
a
storm
on
the
th
october
at
the
mouth
of
the
kaombe
we
were
visited
by
several
men
belonging
to
an
arab
who
had
been
for
fourteen
years
in
the
interior
at
katangas
south
of
cazembes
they
had
just
brought
down
ivory
malachite
copper
rings
and
slaves
to
exchange
for
cloth
at
the
lake
the
malachite
was
said
to
be
dug
out
of
a
large
vein
on
the
side
of
a
hill
near
katangas
they
knew
lake
tanganyika
well
but
had
not
heard
of
the
zambesi
they
spoke
quite
positively
saying
that
the
water
of
lake
tanganyika
flowed
out
by
the
opposite
end
to
that
of
nyassa
as
they
had
seen
neither
of
the
overflows
we
took
it
simply
as
a
piece
of
arab
geography
we
passed
their
establishment
of
long
sheds
next
day
and
were
satisfied
that
the
arabs
must
be
driving
a
good
trade
the
lake
slavetrade
was
going
on
at
a
terrible
rate
two
enterprising
arabs
had
built
a
dhow
and
were
running
her
crowded
with
slaves
regularly
across
the
lake
we
were
told
she
sailed
the
day
before
we
reached
their
headquarters
this
establishment
is
in
the
latitude
of
the
portuguese
slaveexporting
town
of
iboe
and
partly
supplies
that
vile
market
but
the
greater
number
of
the
slaves
go
to
kilwa
we
did
not
see
much
evidence
of
a
wish
to
barter
some
ivory
was
offered
for
sale
but
the
chief
traffic
was
in
human
chattels
would
that
we
could
give
a
comprehensive
account
of
the
horrors
of
the
slavetrade
with
an
approximation
to
the
number
of
lives
it
yearly
destroys
for
we
feel
sure
that
were
even
half
the
truth
told
and
recognized
the
feelings
of
men
would
be
so
thoroughly
roused
that
this
devilish
traffic
in
human
flesh
would
be
put
down
at
all
risks
but
neither
we
nor
any
one
else
have
the
statistics
necessary
for
a
work
of
this
kind
let
us
state
what
we
do
know
of
one
portion
of
africa
and
then
every
reader
who
believes
our
tale
can
apply
the
ratio
of
the
known
misery
to
find
out
the
unknown
we
were
informed
by
colonel
rigby
late
hm
political
agent
and
consul
at
zanzibar
that
slaves
from
this
nyassa
country
alone
pass
annually
through
the
customhouse
of
that
island
this
is
exclusive
of
course
of
those
sent
to
portuguese
slaveports
let
it
not
be
supposed
for
an
instant
that
this
number
represents
all
the
victims
those
taken
out
of
the
country
are
but
a
very
small
section
of
the
sufferers
we
never
realized
the
atrocious
nature
of
the
traffic
until
we
saw
it
at
the
fountainhead
there
truly
satan
has
his
seat
besides
those
actually
captured
thousands
are
killed
and
die
of
their
wounds
and
famine
driven
from
their
villages
by
the
slave
raid
proper
thousands
perish
in
internecine
war
waged
for
slaves
with
their
own
clansmen
and
neighbours
slain
by
the
lust
of
gain
which
is
stimulated
be
it
remembered
always
by
the
slave
purchasers
of
cuba
and
elsewhere
the
many
skeletons
we
have
seen
amongst
rocks
and
woods
by
the
little
pools
and
along
the
paths
of
the
wilderness
attest
the
awful
sacrifice
of
human
life
which
must
be
attributed
directly
or
indirectly
to
this
trade
of
hell
we
would
ask
our
countrymen
to
believe
us
when
we
say
as
we
conscientiously
can
that
it
is
our
deliberate
opinion
from
what
we
know
and
have
seen
that
not
onefifth
of
the
victims
of
the
slavetrade
ever
become
slaves
taking
the
shire
valley
as
an
average
we
should
say
not
even
onetenth
arrive
at
their
destination
as
the
system
therefore
involves
such
an
awful
waste
of
human
lifeor
shall
we
say
of
human
labourand
moreover
tends
directly
to
perpetuate
the
barbarism
of
those
who
remain
in
the
country
the
argument
for
the
continuance
of
this
wasteful
course
because
forsooth
a
fraction
of
the
enslaved
may
find
good
masters
seems
of
no
great
value
this
reasoning
if
not
the
result
of
ignorance
may
be
of
maudlin
philanthropy
a
small
armed
steamer
on
lake
nyassa
could
easily
by
exercising
a
control
and
furnishing
goods
in
exchange
for
ivory
and
other
products
break
the
neck
of
this
infamous
traffic
in
that
quarter
for
nearly
all
must
cross
the
lake
or
the
upper
shire
our
exploration
of
the
lake
extended
from
the
nd
september
to
the
th
october
and
having
expended
or
lost
most
of
the
goods
we
had
brought
it
was
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
ship
when
near
the
southern
end
on
our
return
we
were
told
that
a
very
large
slaveparty
had
just
crossed
to
the
eastern
side
we
heard
the
fire
of
three
guns
in
the
evening
and
judged
by
the
report
that
they
must
be
at
least
sixpounders
they
were
said
to
belong
to
an
ajawa
chief
named
mukata
in
descending
the
shire
we
found
concealed
in
the
broad
belt
of
papyrus
round
the
lakelet
pamalombe
into
which
the
river
expands
a
number
of
manganja
families
who
had
been
driven
from
their
homes
by
the
ajawa
raids
so
thickly
did
the
papyrus
grow
that
when
beat
down
it
supported
their
small
temporary
huts
though
when
they
walked
from
one
hut
to
another
it
heaved
and
bent
beneath
their
feet
as
thin
ice
does
at
home
a
dense
and
impenetrable
forest
of
the
papyrus
was
left
standing
between
them
and
the
land
and
no
one
passing
by
on
the
same
side
would
ever
have
suspected
that
human
beings
lived
there
they
came
to
this
spot
from
the
south
by
means
of
their
canoes
which
enabled
them
to
obtain
a
living
from
the
fine
fish
which
abound
in
the
lakelet
they
had
a
large
quantity
of
excellent
salt
sewed
up
in
bark
some
of
which
we
bought
our
own
having
run
out
we
anchored
for
the
night
off
their
floating
camp
and
were
visited
by
myriads
of
mosquitoes
some
of
the
natives
show
a
love
of
country
quite
surprising
we
saw
fugitives
on
the
mountains
in
the
north
of
the
lake
who
were
persisting
in
clinging
to
the
haunts
of
their
boyhood
and
youth
in
spite
of
starvation
and
the
continual
danger
of
being
put
to
death
by
the
mazitu
a
few
miles
below
the
lakelet
is
the
last
of
the
great
slavecrossings
since
the
ajawa
invasion
the
villages
on
the
left
bank
had
been
abandoned
and
the
people
as
we
saw
in
our
ascent
were
living
on
the
right
or
western
bank
as
we
were
resting
for
a
few
minutes
opposite
the
valuable
fishery
at
movunguti
a
young
effeminatelooking
man
from
some
seacoast
tribe
came
in
great
state
to
have
a
look
at
us
he
walked
under
a
large
umbrella
and
was
followed
by
five
handsome
damsels
gaily
dressed
and
adorned
with
a
view
to
attract
purchasers
one
was
carrying
his
pipe
for
smoking
bang
here
called
chamba
another
his
bow
and
arrows
a
third
his
battleaxe
a
fourth
one
of
his
robes
while
the
last
was
ready
to
take
his
umbrella
when
he
felt
tired
this
show
of
his
merchandise
was
to
excite
the
cupidity
of
any
chief
who
had
ivory
and
may
be
called
the
lawful
way
of
carrying
on
the
slavetrade
what
proportion
it
bears
to
the
other
ways
in
which
we
have
seen
this
traffic
pursued
we
never
found
means
of
forming
a
judgment
he
sat
and
looked
at
us
for
a
few
minutes
the
young
ladies
kneeling
behind
him
and
having
satisfied
himself
that
we
were
not
likely
to
be
customers
he
departed
on
our
first
trip
we
met
at
the
landing
opposite
this
place
a
middle
aged
woman
of
considerable
intelligence
and
possessing
more
knowledge
of
the
country
than
any
of
the
men
our
first
definite
information
about
lake
nyassa
was
obtained
from
her
seeing
us
taking
notes
she
remarked
that
she
had
been
to
the
sea
and
had
there
seen
white
men
writing
she
had
seen
camels
also
probably
among
the
arabs
she
was
the
only
manganja
woman
we
ever
met
who
was
ashamed
of
wearing
the
pelele
or
lipring
she
retired
to
her
hut
took
it
out
and
kept
her
hand
before
her
mouth
to
hide
the
hideous
hole
in
the
lip
while
conversing
with
us
all
the
villagers
respected
her
and
even
the
headmen
took
a
secondary
place
in
her
presence
on
inquiring
for
her
now
we
found
that
she
was
dead
we
never
obtained
sufficient
materials
to
estimate
the
relative
mortality
of
the
highlands
and
lowlands
but
from
many
very
old
white
headed
blacks
having
been
seen
on
the
highlands
we
think
it
probable
that
even
native
races
are
longer
lived
the
higher
their
dwellingplaces
are
we
landed
below
at
mikenas
and
took
observations
for
longitude
to
verify
those
taken
two
years
before
the
village
was
deserted
mikena
and
his
people
having
fled
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
a
few
had
come
across
this
morning
to
work
in
their
old
gardens
after
completing
the
observations
we
had
breakfast
and
as
the
last
of
the
things
were
being
carried
into
the
boat
a
manganja
man
came
running
down
to
his
canoe
crying
out
the
ajawa
have
just
killed
my
comrade
we
shoved
off
and
in
two
minutes
the
advanced
guard
of
a
large
marauding
party
were
standing
with
their
muskets
on
the
spot
where
we
had
taken
breakfast
they
were
evidently
surprised
at
seeing
us
there
and
halted
as
did
also
the
main
body
of
perhaps
a
thousand
men
kill
them
cried
the
manganja
they
are
going
up
to
the
hills
to
kill
the
english
meaning
the
missionaries
we
had
left
at
magomero
but
having
no
prospect
of
friendly
communication
with
them
nor
confidence
in
manganjas
testimony
we
proceeded
down
the
river
leaving
the
ajawa
sitting
under
a
large
baobab
and
the
manganja
cursing
them
most
energetically
across
the
river
on
our
way
up
we
had
seen
that
the
people
of
zimika
had
taken
refuge
on
a
long
island
in
the
shire
where
they
had
placed
stores
of
grain
to
prevent
it
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
ajawa
supposing
afterwards
that
the
invasion
and
war
were
past
they
had
removed
back
again
to
the
mainland
on
the
east
and
were
living
in
fancied
security
on
approaching
the
chiefs
village
which
was
built
in
the
midst
of
a
beautiful
grove
of
lofty
wildfig
and
palm
trees
sounds
of
revelry
fell
upon
our
ears
the
people
were
having
a
merry
timedrumming
dancing
and
drinking
beerwhile
a
powerful
enemy
was
close
at
hand
bringing
death
or
slavery
to
every
one
in
the
village
one
of
our
men
called
out
to
several
who
came
to
the
bank
to
look
at
us
that
the
ajawa
were
coming
and
were
even
now
at
mikenas
village
but
they
were
dazed
with
drinking
and
took
no
notice
of
the
warning
crowds
of
carriers
offered
their
services
after
we
left
the
river
several
sets
of
them
placed
so
much
confidence
in
us
as
to
decline
receiving
payment
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
they
wished
to
work
another
day
and
so
receive
both
days
wages
in
one
piece
the
young
headman
of
a
new
village
himself
came
on
with
his
men
the
march
was
a
pretty
long
one
and
one
of
the
men
proposed
to
lay
the
burdens
down
beside
a
hut
a
mile
or
more
from
the
next
village
the
headman
scolded
the
fellow
for
his
meanness
in
wishing
to
get
rid
of
our
goods
where
we
could
not
procure
carriers
and
made
him
carry
them
on
the
village
at
the
foot
of
the
cataracts
had
increased
very
much
in
size
and
wealth
since
we
passed
it
on
our
way
up
a
number
of
large
new
huts
had
been
built
and
the
people
had
a
good
stock
of
cloth
and
beads
we
could
not
account
for
this
sudden
prosperity
until
we
saw
some
fine
large
canoes
instead
of
the
two
old
leaky
things
which
lay
there
before
this
had
become
a
crossingplace
for
the
slaves
that
the
portuguese
agents
were
carrying
to
tette
because
they
were
afraid
to
take
them
across
nearer
to
where
the
ship
lay
about
seven
miles
off
nothing
was
more
disheartening
than
this
conduct
of
the
manganja
in
profiting
by
the
entire
breaking
up
of
their
nation
we
reached
the
ship
on
the
th
of
november
in
a
very
weak
condition
having
suffered
more
from
hunger
than
on
any
previous
trip
heavy
rains
commenced
on
the
th
and
continued
several
days
the
river
rose
rapidly
and
became
highly
discoloured
bishop
mackenzie
came
down
to
the
ship
on
the
th
with
some
of
the
pioneers
men
who
had
been
at
magomero
for
the
benefit
of
their
health
and
also
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
the
mission
the
bishop
appeared
to
be
in
excellent
spirits
and
thought
that
the
future
promised
fair
for
peace
and
usefulness
the
ajawa
having
been
defeated
and
driven
off
while
we
were
on
the
lake
had
sent
word
that
they
desired
to
live
at
peace
with
the
english
many
of
the
manganja
had
settled
round
magomero
in
order
to
be
under
the
protection
of
the
bishop
and
it
was
hoped
that
the
slavetrade
would
soon
cease
in
the
highlands
and
the
people
be
left
in
the
secure
enjoyment
of
their
industry
the
mission
it
was
also
anticipated
might
soon
become
to
a
considerable
degree
selfsupporting
and
raise
certain
kinds
of
food
like
the
portuguese
of
senna
and
quillimane
mr
burrup
an
energetic
young
man
had
arrived
at
chibisas
the
day
before
the
bishop
having
come
up
the
shire
in
a
canoe
a
surgeon
and
a
lay
brother
followed
behind
in
another
canoe
the
pioneers
draught
being
too
much
for
the
upper
part
of
the
shire
it
was
not
deemed
advisable
to
bring
her
up
on
the
next
trip
further
than
the
ruo
the
bishop
therefore
resolved
to
explore
the
country
from
magomero
to
the
mouth
of
that
river
and
to
meet
the
ship
with
his
sisters
and
mrs
burrup
in
january
this
was
arranged
before
parting
and
then
the
good
bishop
and
burrup
whom
we
were
never
to
meet
again
left
us
they
gave
and
received
three
hearty
english
cheers
as
they
went
to
the
shore
and
we
steamed
off
the
rains
ceased
on
the
th
and
the
waters
of
the
shire
fell
even
more
rapidly
than
they
had
risen
a
shoal
twenty
miles
below
chibisas
checked
our
further
progress
and
we
lay
there
five
weary
weeks
till
the
permanent
rise
of
the
river
took
place
during
this
detention
with
a
large
marsh
on
each
side
the
first
death
occurred
in
the
expedition
which
had
now
been
threeandahalf
years
in
the
country
the
carpenters
mate
a
fine
healthy
young
man
was
seized
with
fever
the
usual
remedies
had
no
effect
he
died
suddenly
while
we
were
at
evening
prayers
and
was
buried
on
shore
he
came
out
in
the
pioneer
and
with
the
exception
of
a
slight
touch
of
fever
at
the
mouth
of
the
rovuma
had
enjoyed
perfect
health
all
the
time
he
had
been
with
us
the
portuguese
are
of
opinion
that
the
european
who
has
immunity
from
this
disease
for
any
length
of
time
after
he
enters
the
country
is
more
likely
to
be
cut
off
by
it
when
it
does
come
than
the
man
who
has
it
frequently
at
first
the
rains
became
pretty
general
towards
the
close
of
december
and
the
shire
was
in
flood
in
the
beginning
of
january
at
our
wooding
place
a
mile
above
the
ruo
the
water
was
three
feet
higher
than
it
was
when
we
were
here
in
june
and
on
the
night
of
the
th
it
rose
eighteen
inches
more
and
swept
down
an
immense
amount
of
brushwood
and
logs
which
swarmed
with
beetles
and
the
two
kinds
of
shells
which
are
common
all
over
the
african
continent
natives
in
canoes
were
busy
spearing
fish
in
the
meadows
and
creeks
and
appeared
to
be
taking
them
in
great
numbers
spurwinged
geese
and
others
of
the
knobnosed
species
took
advantage
of
the
low
gardens
being
flooded
and
came
to
pilfer
the
beans
as
we
passed
the
ruo
on
the
th
and
saw
nothing
of
the
bishop
we
concluded
that
he
had
heard
from
his
surgeon
of
our
detention
and
had
deferred
his
journey
he
arrived
there
five
days
after
on
the
th
after
paying
our
senna
men
as
they
wished
to
go
home
we
landed
them
here
all
were
keen
traders
and
had
invested
largely
in
native
iron
hoes
axes
and
ornaments
many
of
the
hoes
and
spears
had
been
taken
from
the
slaving
parties
whose
captives
we
liberated
for
on
these
occasions
our
senna
friends
were
always
uncommonly
zealous
and
active
the
remainder
had
been
purchased
with
the
old
clothes
we
had
given
them
and
their
store
of
hippopotamus
meat
they
had
no
fear
of
losing
them
or
of
being
punished
for
aiding
us
the
system
in
which
they
had
been
trained
had
eradicated
the
idea
of
personal
responsibility
from
their
minds
the
portuguese
slaveholders
would
blame
the
english
alone
they
said
they
were
our
servants
at
the
time
no
white
man
on
board
could
purchase
so
cheaply
as
these
men
could
many
a
time
had
their
eloquence
persuaded
a
native
trader
to
sell
for
a
bit
of
dirty
worn
cloth
things
for
which
he
had
but
a
little
before
refused
twice
the
amount
of
clean
new
calico
scissors
being
troubled
with
a
cough
at
night
received
a
present
of
a
quilted
coverlet
which
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
service
a
few
days
afterwards
a
good
chance
of
investing
in
hoes
offering
itself
he
ripped
off
both
sides
tore
them
into
a
dozen
pieces
and
purchased
about
a
dozen
hoes
with
them
we
entered
the
zambesi
on
the
th
of
january
and
steamed
down
towards
the
coast
taking
the
side
on
which
we
had
come
up
but
the
channel
had
changed
to
the
other
side
during
the
summer
as
it
sometimes
does
and
we
soon
grounded
a
portuguese
gentleman
formerly
a
lieutenant
in
the
army
and
now
living
on
sangwisa
one
of
the
islands
of
the
zambesi
came
over
with
his
slaves
to
aid
us
in
getting
the
ship
off
he
said
frankly
that
his
people
were
all
great
thieves
and
we
must
be
on
our
guard
not
to
leave
anything
about
he
next
made
a
short
speech
to
his
men
told
them
he
knew
what
thieves
they
were
but
implored
them
not
to
steal
from
us
as
we
would
give
them
a
present
of
cloth
when
the
work
was
done
the
natives
of
this
country
he
remarked
to
us
think
only
of
three
things
what
they
shall
eat
and
drink
how
many
wives
they
can
have
and
what
they
may
steal
from
their
master
if
not
how
they
may
murder
him
he
always
slept
with
a
loaded
musket
by
his
side
this
opinion
may
apply
to
slaves
but
decidedly
does
not
in
our
experience
apply
to
freemen
we
paid
his
men
for
helping
us
and
believe
that
even
they
being
paid
stole
nothing
from
us
our
friend
farms
pretty
extensively
the
large
island
called
sangwisalent
him
for
nothing
by
senhor
ferraoand
raises
large
quantities
of
mapira
and
beans
and
also
beautiful
white
rice
grown
from
seed
brought
a
few
years
ago
from
south
carolina
he
furnished
us
with
some
which
was
very
acceptable
for
though
not
in
absolute
want
we
were
living
on
beans
salt
pork
and
fowls
all
the
biscuit
and
flour
on
board
having
been
expended
we
fully
expected
that
the
owners
of
the
captives
we
had
liberated
would
show
their
displeasure
at
least
by
their
tongues
but
they
seemed
ashamed
only
one
ventured
a
remark
and
he
in
the
course
of
common
conversation
said
with
a
smile
you
took
the
governors
slaves
didnt
you
yes
we
did
free
several
gangs
that
we
met
in
the
manganja
country
the
portuguese
of
tette
from
the
governor
downwards
were
extensively
engaged
in
slaving
the
trade
is
partly
internal
and
partly
external
they
send
some
of
the
captives
and
those
bought
into
the
interior
up
the
zambesi
some
of
these
we
actually
met
on
their
way
up
the
river
the
young
women
were
sold
there
for
ivory
an
ordinarylooking
one
brought
two
arrobas
sixtyfour
pounds
weight
and
an
extra
beauty
brought
twice
that
amount
the
men
and
boys
were
kept
as
carriers
to
take
the
ivory
down
from
the
interior
to
tette
or
were
retained
on
farms
on
the
zambesi
ready
for
export
if
a
slaver
should
call
of
this
last
mode
of
slaving
we
were
witnesses
also
the
slaves
were
sent
down
the
river
chained
and
in
large
canoes
this
went
on
openly
at
tette
and
more
especially
so
while
the
french
free
emigration
system
was
in
full
operation
this
double
mode
of
disposing
of
the
captives
pays
better
than
the
single
system
of
sending
them
down
to
the
coast
for
exportation
one
merchant
at
tette
with
whom
we
were
well
acquainted
sent
into
the
interior
three
hundred
manganja
women
to
be
sold
for
ivory

another
sent

hundred

of

in

of

having
on
board
captain
wilson
with
a
number
of
his
officers
and
men
to
help
us
to
discharge
the
cargo
our
progress
up
was
distressingly
slow
the
river
was
in
flood
and
we
had
a
threeknot
current
against
us
in
many
places
these
delays
kept
us
six
months
in
the
delta
instead
of
as
we
anticipated
only
six
days
for
finding
it
impossible
to
carry
the
sections
up
to
the
ruo
without
great
loss
of
time
it
was
thought
best
to
land
them
at

of

nyassa
together
there
to
tow
her
up
to

a
few
days
before
the

reached
shupanga
captain
wilson
seeing
the
hopeless
state
of
affairs
generously
resolved
to
hasten
with
the
mission
ladies
up
to
those
who
we
thought
were
anxiously
awaiting
their
arrival
and
therefore
started
in
his
gig
for
the
ruo
taking
miss
mackenzie
mrs
burrup
and
his
surgeon
dr
ramsay
they
were
accompanied
by
dr

mr

paymaster
of
the

in
the
whaleboat
of
the

as
our
slowpacedlaunch
ma
robert
had
formerly
gone
up
to
the
foot
of

cataracts
in
nine
days
steaming
it
was
supposed
that
the
boats
might
easily
reach
the
expected
meeting
place
at
the
ruo
in
a
week
but
the
shire
was
now
in
flood
and
in
its
most
rapid
state
and
they
were
longer
in
getting
up
about
half
the
distance
than
it
was
hoped
they
would
be
in
the
whole
navigable
part
of
the
river
they
could
hear
nothing
of
the
bishop
from
the
chief
of
the
island
malo
at
the
mouth
of
the
ruo
no
white
man
had
ever
come
to
his

said
they
proceeded
on
to
chibisas
suffering
terribly
from
mosquitoes
at
night
their
toil
in
stemming
the
rapid
current
made
them
estimate
the
distance
by
the
windings
as
nearer
than
miles
the
makololo
who
had
remained
at
chibisas
told
them
the
sad
news
of
the
death
of
the
good
bishop
and
of
mr
burrup
other
information
received
there
awakened
fresh
anxiety
on
behalf
of
the
survivors
so
leaving
the
ladies
with
dr
ramsay
and
the
makololo
captain
wilson
and
dr
kirk
went
up
the
hills
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
render
assistance
and
on
the
way
they
met
some
of
the
mission
party
at
soches
the
excessive
fatigue
that
our
friends
had
undergone
in
the
voyage
up
to
chibisas
in
no
wise
deterred
them
from
this
further
attempt
for
the
benefit
of
their
countrymen
but
the
fresh
labour
with
diminished
rations
was
too
much
for
their
strength
they
were
reduced
to
a
diet
of
native
beans
and
an
occasional
fowl
both
became
very
ill
of
fever
captain
wilson
so
dangerously
that
his
fellowsufferer
lost
all
hopes
of
his
recovery
his
strong
ablebodied
cockswain
did
good
service
in
cheerfully
carrying
his
muchloved
commander
and
they
managed
to
return
to
the
boat
and
brought
the
two
bereaved
and
sorrowstricken
ladies
back
to
the
pioneer
we
learnt
that
the
bishop
wishing
to
find
a
shorter
route
down
to
the
shire
had
sent
two
men
to
explore
the
country
between
magomero
and
the
junction
of
the
ruo
and
in
december
messrs
proctor
and
scudamore
with
a
number
of
manganja
carriers
left
magomero
for
the
same
purpose
they
were
to
go
close
to
mount
choro
and
then
skirt
the
elephant
marsh
with
mount
clarendon
on
their
left
their
guides
seem
to
have
led
them
away
to
the
east
instead
of
south
to
the
upper
waters
of
the
ruo
in
the
shirwa
valley
instead
of
to
its
mouth
entering
an
anguru
slavetrading
village
they
soon
began
to
suspect
that
the
people
meant
mischief
and
just
before
sunset
a
woman
told
some
of
their
men
that
if
they
slept
there
they
would
all
be
killed
on
their
preparing
to
leave
the
anguru
followed
them
and
shot
their
arrows
at
the
retreating
party
two
of
the
carriers
were
captured
and
all
the
goods
were
taken
by
these
robbers
an
arrowhead
struck
deep
into
the
stock
of
proctors
gun
and
the
two
missionaries
barely
escaping
with
their
lives
swam
a
deep
river
at
night
and
returned
to
magomero
famished
and
exhausted
the
wives
of
the
captive
carriers
came
to
the
bishop
day
after
day
weeping
and
imploring
him
to
rescue
their
husbands
from
slavery
the
men
had
been
caught
while
in
his
service
no
one
else
could
be
entreated
there
was
no
public
law
nor
any
power
superior
to
his
own
to
which
an
appeal
could
be
made
for
in
him
church
and
state
were
in
the
disorganized
state
of
the
country
virtually
united
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
clearly
his
duty
to
try
and
rescue
these
kidnapped
members
of
the
mission
family
he
accordingly
invited
the
veteran
makololo
to
go
with
him
on
this
somewhat
hazardous
errand
nothing
could
have
been
proposed
to
them
which
they
would
have
liked
better
and
they
went
with
alacrity
to
eat
the
sheep
of
the
anguru
only
regretting
that
the
enemy
did
not
keep
cattle
as
well
had
the
matter
been
left
entirely
in
their
hands
they
would
have
made
a
clean
sweep
of
that
part
of
the
country
but
the
bishop
restrained
them
and
went
in
an
open
manner
thus
commending
the
measure
to
all
the
natives
as
one
of
justice
this
deliberation
however
gave
the
delinquents
a
chance
of
escape
the
missionaries
were
successful
the
offending
village
was
burned
and
a
few
sheep
and
goats
were
secured
which
could
not
be
considered
other
than
a
very
mild
punishment
for
the
offence
committed
the
headman
muanasomba
afraid
to
retain
the
prisoners
any
longer
forthwith
liberated
them
and
they
returned
to
their
homes
this
incident
took
place
at
the
time
we
were
at
the
ruo
and
during
the
rains
and
proved
very
trying
to
the
health
of
the
missionaries
they
were
frequently
wetted
and
had
hardly
any
food
but
roasted
maize
mr
scudamore
was
never
well
afterwards
directly
on
their
return
to
magomero
the
bishop
and
mr
burrup
both
suffering
from
diarrhoea
in
consequence
of
wet
hunger
and
exposure
started
for
chibisas
to
go
down
to
the
ruo
by
the
shire
so
fully
did
the
bishop
expect
a
renewal
of
the
soaking
wet
from
which
he
had
just
returned
that
on
leaving
magomero
he
walked
through
the
stream
the
rivulets
were
so
swollen
that
it
took
five
days
to
do
a
journey
that
would
otherwise
have
occupied
only
two
days
and
a
half
none
of
the
manganja
being
willing
to
take
them
down
the
river
during
the
flood
three
makololo
canoemen
agreed
to
go
with
them
after
paddling
till
near
sunset
they
decided
to
stop
and
sleep
on
shore
but
the
mosquitoes
were
so
numerous
that
they
insisted
on
going
on
again
the
bishop
being
a
week
behind
the
time
he
had
engaged
to
be
at
the
ruo
reluctantly
consented
and
in
the
darkness
the
canoe
was
upset
in
one
of
the
strong
eddies
or
whirlpools
which
suddenly
boil
up
in
flood
time
near
the
outgoing
branches
of
the
river
clothing
medicines
tea
coffee
and
sugar
were
all
lost
wet
and
weary
and
tormented
by
mosquitoes
they
lay
in
the
canoe
till
morning
dawned
and
then
proceeded
to
malo
an
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
ruo
where
the
bishop
was
at
once
seized
with
fever
had
they
been
in
their
usual
health
they
would
doubtless
have
pushed
on
to
shupanga
or
to
the
ship
but
fever
rapidly
prostrates
the
energies
and
induces
a
drowsy
stupor
from
which
if
not
roused
by
medicine
the
patient
gradually
sinks
into
the
sleep
of
death
still
mindful
however
of
his
office
the
bishop
consoled
himself
by
thinking
that
he
might
gain
the
friendship
of
the
chief
which
would
be
of
essential
service
to
him
in
his
future
labours
that
heartless
man
however
probably
suspicious
of
all
foreigners
from
the
knowledge
he
had
acquired
of
white
slavetraders
wanted
to
turn
the
dying
bishop
out
of
the
hut
as
he
required
it
for
his
corn
but
yielded
to
the
expostulations
of
the
makololo
day
after
day
for
three
weeks
did
these
faithful
fellows
remain
beside
his
mat
on
the
floor
till
without
medicine
or
even
proper
food
he
died
they
dug
his
grave
on
the
edge
of
the
deep
dark
forest
where
the
natives
buried
their
dead
mr
burrup
himself
far
gone
with
dysentery
staggered
from
the
hut
and
as
in
the
dusk
of
evening
they
committed
the
bishops
body
to
the
grave
repeated
from
memory
portions
of
our
beautiful
service
for
the
burial
of
the
deadearth
to
earth
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
in
sure
and
certain
hope
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
in
this
sad
way
ended
the
earthly
career
of
one
of
whom
it
can
safely
be
said
that
for
unselfish
goodness
of
heart
and
earnest
devotion
to
the
noble
work
he
had
undertaken
none
of
the
commendations
of
his
friends
can
exceed
the
reality
the
grave
in
which
his
body
rests
is
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
confluence
of
the
ruo
on
the
left
bank
of
the
shire
and
opposite
the
island
of
malo
the
makololo
then
took
mr
burrup
up
in
the
canoe
as
far
as
they
could
and
making
a
litter
of
branches
carried
him
themselves
or
got
others
to
carry
him
all
the
way
back
to
his
countrymen
at
magomero
they
hurried
him
on
lest
he
should
die
in
their
hands
and
blame
be
attached
to
them
soon
after
his
return
he
expired
from
the
disease
which
was
on
him
when
he
started
to
meet
his
wife
captain
wilson
arrived
at
shupanga
on
the
th
of
march
having
been
three
weeks
on

the
gorgon
had
been
driven
out
to
sea
in
a
gale
and
had
gone
to
johanna
for
provisions
and
it
was
the
nd
of
april
before
she
returned
it
was
fortunate
for
us
that
she
had
obtained
a
supply
as
our
provisions
were
exhausted
and
we
had
to
buy
some
from
the
master
of
the
brig

gorgon
left
for
the
cape
on
the
th
taking
all
except
one
of
the
mission
party
who
had
come
in
january
we
take
this
opportunity
of
expressing
our
heartfelt
gratitude
to
the
gallant
captain
i
c
wilson
and
his
officers
for
innumerable
acts
of
kindness
and
hearty
cooperation
our
warmest
thanks
are
also
due
to
captain
r
b
oldfield
and
the
other
officers
from
the
admiral
downwards
and
we
beg
to
assure
them
that
nothing
could
be
more
encouraging
to
us
in
our
difficulties
and
trials
than
the
knowledge
that
we
possessed
their
friendship
and
sympathy
in
our
labours
the
rev
james
stewart
of
the
free
church
of
scotland
arrived
in
the
gorgon
he
had
wisely
come
out
to
inspect
the
country
before
deciding
on
the
formation
of
a
mission
in
the
interior
to
this
object
he
devoted
many
months
of
earnest
labour
this
mission
was
intended
to
embrace
both
the
industrial
and
the
religious
element
and
as
the
route
by
the
zambesi
and
shire
forms
the
only
one
at
present
known
with
but
a
couple
of
days
land
journey
to
the
highlands
which
stretch
to
an
unknown
distance
into
the
continent
and
as
no
jealousy
was
likely
to
be
excited
in
the
mind
of
a
man
of
bishop
mackenzies
enlarged
viewsthere
being
moreover
room
for
hundreds
of
missionswe
gladly
extended
the
little
aid
in
our
power
to
an
envoy
from
the
energetic
body
above
mentioned
but
recommended
him
to
examine
the
field
with
his
own
eyes
during
our
subsequent
detention
at
shupanga
he
proceeded
as
far
up
the
shire
as
the
upper
cataracts
and
saw
the
mere
remnants
of
that
dense
population
which
we
at
first
had
found
living
in
peace
and
plenty
but
which
was
now
scattered
and
destroyed
by
famine
and
slavehunting
the
land
which
both
before
and
after
we
found
so
fair
and
fruitful
was
burned
up
by
a
severe
drought
in
fact
it
was
at
its
very
worst
with
most
praiseworthy
energy
and
in
spite
of
occasional
attacks
of
fever
he
then
ascended
the
zambesi
as
far
as
kebrabasa
and
what
may
be
of
interest
to
some
compared
it
in
parts
to
the
danube
his
estimate
of
the
highlands
would
naturally
be
lower
than
ours
the
main
drawbacks
in
his
opinion
however
were
the
slavetrade
and
the
power
allowed
the
effete
portuguese
of
shutting
up
the
country
from
all
except
a
few
convicts
of
their
own
nation
the
time
of
his
coming
was
inopportune
the
disasters
which
from
inexperience
had
befallen
the
mission
of
the
universities
had
a
depressing
effect
on
the
minds
of
many
at
home
and
rendered
a
new
attempt
unadvisable
though
had
the
scotch
perseverance
and
energy
been
introduced
it
is
highly
probable
that
they
would
have
reacted
most
beneficially
on
the
zeal
of
our
english
brethren
and
desertion
would
never
have
been
heard
of
after
examining
the
country
mr
stewart
descended
the
zambesi
in
the
beginning
of
the
following
year
and
proceeded
homewards
with
his
report
by
mosambique
and
the
cape
on
the
th
of
april
we
had
only
one
man
fit
for
duty
all
the
rest
were
down
with
fever
or
with
the
vile
spirit
secretly
sold
to
them
by
the
portuguese
officer
of
customs
in
spite
of
our
earnest
request
to
him
to
refrain
from
the
pernicious
traffic
we
started
on
the
th
for
shupanga
with
another
load
of
the
lady
nyassa
as
we
steamed
up
the
delta
we
observed
many
of
the
natives
wearing
strips
of
palmleaf
the
signs
of
sickness
and
mourning
for
they
too
suffer
from
fever
this
is
the
unhealthy
season
the
rains
are
over
and
the
hot
sun
draws
up
malaria
from
the
decayed
vegetation
disease
seemed
peculiarly
severe
this
year
on
our
way
up
we
met
mr
waller
who
had
come
from
magomero
for
provisions
the
missionaries
were
suffering
severely
from
want
of
food
the
liberated
people
were
starving
and
dying
of
diarrhoea
and
loathsome
sores
the
ajawa
stimulated
in
their
slave
raids
by
supplies
of
ammunition
and
cloth
from
the
portuguese
had
destroyed
the
large
crops
of
the
past
year
a
drought
had
followed
and
little
or
no
food
could
be
bought
with
his
usual
energy
mr
waller
hired
canoes
loaded
them
with
stores
and
took
them
up
the
long
weary
way
to
chibisas
before
he
arrived
he
was
informed
that
the
mission
of
the
universities
now
deprived
of
its
brave
leader
had
retired
from
the
highlands
down
to
the
low
shire
valley
this
appeared
to
us
who
knew
the
danger
of
leading
a
sedentary
life
the
greatest
mistake
they
could
have
made
and
was
the
result
of
no
other
counsel
or
responsibility
than
their
own
waller
would
have
reascended
at
once
to
the
higher
altitude
but
various
objections
stood
in
the
way
the
loss
of
poor
scudamore
and
dickinson
in
this
lowlying
situation
but
added
to
the
regret
that
the
highlands
had
not
received
a
fair
trial
when
the
news
of
the
bishops
unfortunate
collisions
with
the
natives
and
of
his
untimely
end
reached
england
much
blame
was
imputed
to
him
the
policy
which
with
the
formal
sanction
of
all
his
companions
he
had
adopted
being
directly
contrary
to
the
advice
which
dr
livingstone
tendered
and
to
the
assurances
of
the
peaceable
nature
of
the
mission
which
the
doctor
had
given
to
the
natives
a
friendly
disapproval
of
a
bishops
engaging
in
war
was
ventured
on
when
we
met
him
at
chibisas
in
november
but
when
we
found
his
conduct
regarded
with
so
much
bitterness
in
england
whether
from
a
disposition
to
stand
by
the
down
man
or
from
having
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
country
in
which
he
was
placed
or
from
the
thorough
confidence
which
intimacy
caused
us
to
repose
in
his
genuine
piety
and
devout
service
of
god
we
came
to
think
much
more
leniently
of
his
proceedings
than
his
assailants
did
he
never
seemed
to
doubt
but
that
he
had
done
his
duty
and
throughout
he
had
always
been
supported
by
his
associates
the
question
whether
a
bishop
in
the
event
of
his
flock
being
torn
from
his
bosom
may
make
war
to
rescue
them
requires
serious
consideration
it
seems
to
narrow
itself
into
whether
a
christian
man
may
lawfully
use
the
civil
power
or
the
sword
at
all
in
defensive
war
as
police
or
otherwise
we
would
do
almost
anything
to
avoid
a
collision
with
degraded
natives
but
in
case
of
an
invasionour
blood
boils
at
the
very
thought
of
our
wives
daughters
or
sisters
being
touchedwe
as
men
with
human
feelings
would
unhesitatingly
fight
to
the
death
with
all
the
fury
in
our
power
the
good
bishop
was
as
intensely
averse
to
using
arms
before
he
met
the
slavehunters
as
any
man
in
england
in
the
course
he
pursued
he
may
have
made
a
mistake
but
it
is
a
mistake
which
very
few
englishmen
on
meeting
bands
of
helpless
captives
or
members
of
his
family
in
bonds
would
have
failed
to
commit
likewise
during
unhealthy
april
the
fever
was
more
severe
in
shupanga
and
mazaro
than
usual
we
had
several
cases
on
boardthey
were
quickly
cured
but
from
our
being
in
the
delta
as
quickly
returned
about
the
middle
of
the
month
mrs
livingstone
was
prostrated
by
this
disease
and
it
was
accompanied
by
obstinate
vomiting
nothing
is
yet
known
that
can
allay
this
distressing
symptom
which
of
course
renders
medicine
of
no
avail
as
it
is
instantly
rejected
she
received
whatever
medical
aid
could
be
rendered
from
dr
kirk
but
became
unconscious
and
her
eyes
were
closed
in
the
sleep
of
death
as
the
sunset
on
the
evening
of
the
christian
sabbath
the
th
april
a
coffin
was
made
during
the
night
a
grave
was
dug
next
day
under
the
branches
of
the
great
baobabtree
and
with
sympathizing
hearts
the
little
band
of
his
countrymen
assisted
the
bereaved
husband
in
burying
his
dead
at
his
request
the
rev
james
stewart
read
the
burialservice
and
the
seamen
kindly
volunteered
to
mount
guard
for
some
nights
at
the
spot
where
her
body
rests
in
hope
those
who
are
not
aware
how
this
brave
good
english
wife
made
a
delightful
home
at
kolobeng
a
thousand
miles
inland
from
the
cape
and
as
the
daughter
of
moffat
and
a
christian
lady
exercised
most
beneficial
influence
over
the
rude
tribes
of
the
interior
may
wonder
that
she
should
have
braved
the
dangers
and
toils
of
this
downtrodden
land
she
knew
them
all
and
in
the
disinterested
and
dutiful
attempt
to
renew
her
labours
was
called
to
her
rest

charles

started
in
the
boat
for
tette
in
order
to
see
the
property
of
the
expedition
brought
down
in
canoes
they
took
four
mazaro
canoemen
to
manage
the
boat
and
a
white
sailor
to
cook
for
them
but
unfortunately
he
caught
fever
the
very
day
after
leaving
the
ship
and
was
ill
most
of
the
trip
so
they
had
to
cook
for
themselves
and
to
take
care
of
him
besides
we
now
proceeded
with
preparations
for
the
launch
of
the
lady
nyassa
ground
was
levelled
on
the
bank
at
shupanga
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
the
compartments
in
order
she
was
placed
on
palmtrees
which
were
brought
from
a
place
lower
down
the
river
for
ways
and
the
engineer
and
his
assistants
were
soon
busily
engaged
about
a
fortnight
after
they
were
all
brought
from
kongone
the
sections
were
screwed
together
the
blacks
are
more
addicted
to
stealing
where
slavery
exists
than
elsewhere
we
were
annoyed
by
thieves
who
carried
off
the
iron
screwbolts
but
were
gratified
to
find
that
strychnine
saved
us
from
the
manthief
as
well
as
the
hyenathief
a
hyena
was
killed
by
it
and
after
the
natives
saw
the
dead
animal
and
knew
how
we
had
destroyed
it
they
concluded
that
it
was
not
safe
to
steal
from
men
who
possessed
a
medicine
so
powerful
the
halfcaste
who
kept
shupangahouse
said
he
wished
to
have
some
to
give
to
the
zulus
of
whom
he
was
mortally
afraid
and
to
whom
he
had
to
pay
an
unwilling
tribute
the
pioneer
made
several
trips
to
the
kongone
and
returned
with
the
last
load
on
the
th
of
june
on
the
rd
the
lady
nyassa
was
safely
launched
the
work
of
putting
her
together
having
been
interrupted
by
fever
and
dysentery
and
many
other
causes
which
it
would
only
weary
the
reader
to
narrate
in
detail
natives
from
all
parts
of
the
country
came
to
see
the
launch
most
of
them
quite
certain
that
being
made
of
iron
she
must
go
to
the
bottom
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
water
earnest
discussions
had
taken
place
among
them
with
regard
to
the
propriety
of
using
iron
for
shipbuilding
the
majority
affirmed
that
it
would
never
answer
they
said
if
we
put
a
hoe
into
the
water
or
the
smallest
bit
of
iron
it
sinks
immediately
how
then
can
such
a
mass
of
iron
float
it
must
go
to
the
bottom
the
minority
answered
that
this
might
be
true
with
them
but
white
men
had
medicine
for
everything
they
could
even
make
a
woman
all
except
the
speaking
look
at
that
one
on
the
figure
head
of
the
vessel
the
unbelievers
were
astonished
and
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
when
they
saw
the
ship
float
lightly
and
gracefully
on
the
river
instead
of
going
to
the
bottom
as
they
so
confidently
predicted
truly
they
said
these
men
have
powerful
medicine
birds
are
numerous
on
the
shupanga
estate
some
kinds
remain
all
the
year
round
while
many
others
are
there
only
for
a
few
months
flocks
of
green
pigeons
come
in
april
to
feed
on
the
young
fruit
of
the
wild
fig
trees
which
is
also
eaten
by
a
large
species
of
bat
in
the
evenings
the
pretty
little
black
weaver
with
yellow
shoulders
appears
to
enjoy
life
intensely
after
assuming
his
wooing
dress
a
hearty
breakfast
is
eaten
in
the
mornings
and
then
come
the
hours
for
making
merry
a
select
party
of
three
or
four
perch
on
the
bushes
which
skirt
a
small
grassy
plain
and
cheer
themselves
with
the
music
of
their
own
quiet
and
selfcomplacent
song
a
playful
performance
on
the
wind
succeeds
expanding
his
soft
velvetlike
plumage
one
glides
with
quivering
pinions
to
the
centre
of
the
open
space
singing
as
he
flies
then
turns
with
a
rapid
whirring
sound
from
his
wingssomewhat
like
a
childs
rattleand
returns
to
his
place
again
one
by
one
the
others
perform
the
same
feat
and
continue
the
sport
for
hours
striving
which
can
produce
the
loudest
brattle
while
turning
these
games
are
only
played
during
the
season
of
courting
and
of
the
gay
feathers
the
merriment
seems
never
to
be
thought
of
while
the
bird
wears
his
winter
suit
of
sober
brown
we
received
two
mules
from
the
cape
to
aid
us
in
transporting
the
pieces
of
the
lady
nyassa
past
the
cataracts
and
landed
them
at
shupanga
but
they
soon
perished
a
portuguese
gentleman
kindly
informed
us
after
both
the
mules
were
dead
that
he
knew
they
would
die
for
the
land
there
had
been
often
tried
and
nothing
would
live
on
itnot
even
a
pig
he
said
he
had
not
told
us
so
before
because
he
did
not
like
to
appear
officious
by
the
time
everything
had
been
placed
on
board
the
lady
nyassa
the
waters
of
the
zambesi
and
the
shire
had
fallen
so
low
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
taking
her
up
to
the
cataracts
before
the
rains
in
december
draught
oxen
and
provisions
also
were
required
and
could
not
be
obtained
nearer
than
the
island
of
johanna
the
portuguese
without
refusing
positively
to
let
trade
enter
the
zambesi
threw
impediments
in
the
way
they
only
wanted
a
small
duty
they
were
about
to
establish
a
river
police
and
rearrange
the
crown
lands
which
have
long
since
become
zulu
lands
meanwhile
they
were
making
the
zambesi
by
slaving
of
no
value
to
any
one
the
rovuma
which
was
reported
to
come
from
lake
nyassa
being
out
of
their
claims
and
a
free
river
we
determined
to
explore
it
in
our
boats
immediately
on
our
return
from
johanna
for
which
place
after
some
delay
at
the
kongone
in
repairing
engines
paddlewheel
and
rudder
we
sailed
on
the
th
of
august
a
store
of
naval
provisions
had
been
formed
on
a
hulk
in
pomone
bay
of
that
island
for
the
supply
of
the
cruisers
and
was
in
charge
of
mr
sunley
the
consul
from
whom
we
always
received
the
kindest
attentions
and
assistance
he
now
obliged
us
by
parting
with
six
oxen
trained
for
his
own
use
in
sugarmaking
though
sadly
hampered
in
his
undertaking
by
being
obliged
to
employ
slave
labour
he
has
by
indomitable
energy
overcome
obstacles
under
which
most
persons
would
have
sunk
he
has
done
all
that
under
the
circumstances
could
be
done
to
infuse
a
desire
for
freedom
by
paying
regular
wages
and
has
established
a
large
factory
and
brought
acres
of
rich
soil
under
cultivation
with
sugarcane
we
trust
he
will
realize
the
fortune
which
he
so
well
deserves
to
earn
had
mr
sunley
performed
the
same
experiment
on
the
mainland
where
people
would
have
flocked
to
him
for
the
wages
he
now
gives
he
would
certainly
have
inaugurated
a
new
era
on
the
east
coast
of
africa
on
a
small
island
where
the
slaveholders
have
complete
power
over
the
slaves
and
where
there
is
no
free
soil
such
as
is
everywhere
met
with
in
africa
the
experiment
ought
not
to
be
repeated
were
mr
sunley
commencing
again
it
should
neither
be
in
zanzibar
nor
johanna
but
on
african
soil
where
if
even
a
slave
is
illtreated
he
can
easily
by
flight
become
free
on
an
island
under
native
rule
a
joint
manufacture
by
arabs
and
englishmen
might
only
mean
that
the
latter
were
to
escape
the
odium
of
flogging
the
slaves
on
leaving
johanna
and
our
oxen
for
a
time
hms
orestes
towed
us
thence
to
the
mouth
of
the
rovuma
at
the
beginning
of
september
captain
gardner
her
commander
and
several
of
his
officers
accompanied
us
up
the
river
for
two
days
in
the
gig
and
cutter
the
water
was
unusually
low
and
it
was
rather
dull
work
for
a
few
hours
in
the
morning
but
the
scene
became
livelier
and
more
animated
when
the
breeze
began
to
blow
our
four
boats
they
swept
on
under
full
sail
the
men
on
the
look
out
in
the
gig
and
cutter
calling
port

as

while
the
black
men
in

of
the
others
shouted
the
practical

presently
the
leadingboat
touches
on
a
sandbank
down
comes
the
fluttering
sail
the
men
jump
out
to
shove
her
off
and
the
other
boats
shunning
the
obstruction
shoot
on
ahead
to
be
brought
up
each
in
its
turn
by
mistaking
a
sandbank
for
the
channel
which
had
often
but
a
very
little
depth
of
water
a
drowsy
herd
of
hippopotami
were
suddenly
startled
by
a
score
of
rifle
shots
and
stared
in
amazement
at
the
strange
objects
which
had
invaded
their
peaceful
domains
until
a
few
more
bullets
compelled
them
to
seek
refuge
at
the
bottom
of
the
deep
pool
near
which
they
had
been
quietly
reposing
on
our
return
one
of
the
herd
retaliated
he
followed
the
boat
came
up
under
it
and
twice
tried
to
tear
the
bottom
out
of
it
but
fortunately
it
was
too
flat
for
his
jaws
to
get
a
good
grip
so
he
merely
damaged
one
of
the
planks
with
his
tusks
though
he
lifted
the
boat
right
up
with
ten
men
and
a
ton
of
ebony
in
it
we
slept
one
of
the
two
nights
captain
gardner
was
with
us
opposite
the
lakelet
chidia
which
is
connected
with
the
river
in
flood
time
and
is
nearly
surrounded
by
hills
some
or
feet
high
dotted
over
with
trees
a
few
small
groups
of
huts
stood
on
the
hillsides
with
gardens
off
which
the
usual
native
produce
had
been
reaped
the
people
did
not
seem
much
alarmed
by
the
presence
of
the
large
party
which
had
drawn
up
on
the
sandbanks
below
their
dwellings
there
is
abundance
of
large
ebony
in
the
neighbourhood
the
pretty
little
antelope
cephalophus
caeruleus
about
the
size
of
a
hare
seemed
to
abound
as
many
of
their
skins
were
offered
for
sale
neat
figured
dateleaf
mats
of
various
colours
are
woven
here
the
different
dyes
being
obtained
from
the
barks
of
trees
cattle
could
not
live
on
the
banks
of
the
rovuma
on
account
of
the
tsetse
which
are
found
from
near
the
mouth
up
as
far
as
we
could
take
the
boats
the
navigation
did
not
improve
as
we
ascended
snags
brought
down
by
the
floods
were
common
and
left
in
the
channel
on
the
sudden
subsidence
of
the
water
in
many
places
where
the
river
divided
into
two
or
three
channels
there
was
not
water
enough
in
any
of
them
for
a
boat
drawing
three
feet
so
we
had
to
drag
ours
over
the
shoals
but
we
saw
the
river
at
its
very
lowest
and
it
may
be
years
before
it
is
so
dried
up
again
the
valley
of
the
rovuma
bounded
on
each
side
by
a
range
of
highlands
is
from
two
to
four
miles
in
width
and
comes
in
a
pretty
straight
course
from
the
wsw
but
the
channel
of
the
river
is
winding
and
now
at
its
lowest
zigzagged
so
perversely
that
frequently
the
boats
had
to
pass
over
three
miles
to
make
one
in
a
straight
line
with
a
full
stream
it
must
of
course
be
much
easier
work
few
natives
were
seen
during
the
first
week
their
villages
are
concealed
in
the
thick
jungle
on
the
hill
sides
for
protection
from
marauding
slaveparties
not
much
of
interest
was
observed
on
this
part
of
the
silent
and
shallow
river
though
feeling
convinced
that
it
was
unfit
for
navigation
except
for
eight
months
of
the
year
we
pushed
on
resolved
to
see
if
further
inland
the
accounts
we
had
received
from
different
naval
officers
of
its
great
capabilities
would
prove
correct
or
if
by
communication
with
lake
nyassa
even
the
upper
part
could
be
turned
to
account
our
exploration
showed
us
that
the
greatest
precaution
is
required
in
those
who
visit
new
countries
the
reports
we
received
from
gentlemen
who
had
entered
the
river
and
were
well
qualified
to
judge
were
that
the
rovuma
was
infinitely
superior
to
the
zambesi
in
the
absence
of
any
bar
at
its
mouth
in
its
greater
volume
of
water
and
in
the
beauty
of
the
adjacent
lands
we
probably
came
at
a
different
season
from
that
in
which
they
visited
it
and
our
account
ought
to
be
taken
with
theirs
to
arrive
at
the
truth
it
might
be
available
as
a
highway
for
commerce
during
three
quarters
of
each
year
but
casual
visitors
like
ourselves
and
others
are
all
ill
able
to
decide
the
absence
of
animal
life
was
remarkable
occasionally
we
saw
pairs
of
the
stately
jabirus
or
adjutantlooking
marabouts
wading
among
the
shoals
and
spurwinged
geese
and
other
waterfowl
but
there
was
scarcely
a
crocodile
or
a
hippopotamus
to
be
seen
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
an
old
man
called
at
our
camp
and
said
he
would
send
a
present
from
his
village
which
was
up
among
the
hills
he
appeared
next
morning
with
a
number
of
his
people
bringing
meal
cassava
root
and
yams
the
language
differs
considerably
from
that
on
the
zambesi
but
it
is
of
the
same
family
the
people
are
makonde
and
are
on
friendly
terms
with
the
mabiha
and
the
makoa
who
live
south
of
the
rovuma
when
taking
a
walk
up
the
slopes
of
the
north
bank
we
found
a
great
variety
of
trees
we
had
seen
nowhere
else
those
usually
met
with
far
inland
seem
here
to
approach
the
coast
african
ebony
generally
named
mpingu
is
abundant
within
eight
miles
of
the
sea
it
attains
a
larger
size
and
has
more
of
the
interior
black
wood
than
usual
a
good
timber
tree
called
mosoko
is
also
found
and
we
saw
halfcaste
arabs
near
the
coast
cutting
up
a
large
log
of
it
into
planks
before
reaching
the
top
of
the
rise
we
were
in
a
forest
of
bamboos
on
the
plateau
above
large
patches
were
cleared
and
cultivated
a
man
invited
us
to
take
a
cup
of
beer
on
our
complying
with
his
request
the
fear
previously
shown
by
the
bystanders
vanished
our
mazaro
men
could
hardly
understand
what
they
said
some
of
them
waded
in
the
river
and
caught
a
curious
fish
in
holes
in
the
claybank
its
ventral
fin
is
peculiar
being
unusually
large
and
of
a
circular
shape
like
boys
playthings
called
suckers
we
were
told
that
this
fish
is
found
also
in
the
zambesi
and
is
called
chirire
though
all
its
fins
are
large
it
is
asserted
that
it
rarely
ventures
out
into
the
stream
but
remains
near
its
hole
where
it
is
readily
caught
by
the
hand
the
zambesi
men
thoroughly
understood
the
characteristic
marks
of
deep
or
shallow
water
and
showed
great
skill
in
finding
out
the
proper
channel
the
molimo
is
the
steersman
at
the
helm
the
mokadamo
is
the
head
canoe
man
and
he
stands
erect
on
the
bows
with
a
long
pole
in
his
hands
and
directs
the
steersman
where
to
go
aiding
the
rudder
if
necessary
with
his
pole
the
others
preferred
to
stand
and
punt
our
boat
rather
than
row
with
our
long
oars
being
able
to
shove
her
ahead
faster
than
they
could
pull
her
they
are
accustomed
to
short
paddles
our
mokadamo
was
affected
with
moonblindness
and
could
not
see
at
all
at
night
his
comrades
then
led
him
about
and
handed
him
his
food
they
thought
that
it
was
only
because
his
eyes
rested
all
night
that
he
could
see
the
channel
so
well
by
day
at
difficult
places
the
mokadamo
sometimes
however
made
mistakes
and
ran
us
aground
and
the
others
evidently
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
resistance
to
constituted
authority
and
led
by
joao
an
aspirant
for
the
office
jeered
him
for
his
stupidity
was
he
asleep
why
did
he
allow
the
boat
to
come
there
could
he
not
see
the
channel
was
somewhere
else
at
last
the
mokadamo
threw
down
the
pole
in
disgust
and
told
joao
he
might
be
a
mokadamo
himself
the
office
was
accepted
with
alacrity
but
in
a
few
minutes
he
too
ran
us
into
a
worse
difficulty
than
his
predecessor
ever
did
and
was
at
once
disrated
amidst
the
derision
of
his
comrades
on
the
th
september
we
arrived
at
the
inhabited
island
of
kichokomane
the
usual
way
of
approaching
an
unknown
people
is
to
call
out
in
a
cheerful
tone
malonda
things
for
sale
or
do
you
want
to
sell
anything
if
we
can
obtain
a
man
from
the
last
village
he
is
employed
though
only
useful
in
explaining
to
the
next
that
we
come
in
a
friendly
way
the
people
here
were
shy
of
us
at
first
and
could
not
be
induced
to
sell
any
food
until
a
woman
more
adventurous
than
the
rest
sold
us
a
fowl
this
opened
the
market
and
crowds
came
with
fowls
and
meal
far
beyond
our
wants
the
women
are
as
ugly
as
those
on
lake
nyassa
for
who
can
be
handsome
wearing
the
pelele
or
upperlip
ring
of
large
dimensions
we
were
once
surprised
to
see
young
men
wearing
the
pelele
and
were
told
that
in
the
tribe
of
the
mabiha
on
the
south
bank
men
as
well
as
women
wore
them
along
the
left
bank
above
kichokomane
is
an
exceedingly
fertile
plain
nearly
two
miles
broad
and
studded
with
a
number
of
deserted
villages
the
inhabitants
were
living
in
temporary
huts
on
low
naked
sandbanks
and
we
found
this
to
be
the
case
as
far
as
we
went
they
leave
most
of
their
property
and
food
behind
because
they
are
not
afraid
of
these
being
stolen
but
only
fear
being
stolen
themselves
the
great
slaveroute
from
nyassa
to
kilwa
passes
to
ne
from
sw
just
beyond
them
and
it
is
dangerous
to
remain
in
their
villages
at
this
time
of
year
when
the
kidnappers
are
abroad
in
one
of
the
temporary
villages
we
saw
in
passing
two
human
heads
lying
on
the
ground
we
slept
a
couple
of
miles
above
this
village
before
sunrise
next
morning
a
large
party
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
and
muskets
came
to
the
camp
two
or
three
of
them
having
a
fowl
each
which
we
refused
to
purchase
having
bought
enough
the
day
before
they
followed
us
all
the
morning
and
after
breakfast
those
on
the
left
bank
swam
across
and
joined
the
main
party
on
the
other
side
it
was
evidently
their
intention
to
attack
us
at
a
chosen
spot
where
we
had
to
pass
close
to
a
high
bank
but
their
plan
was
frustrated
by
a
stiff
breeze
sweeping
the
boat
past
before
the
majority
could
get
to
the
place
they
disappeared
then
but
came
out
again
ahead
of
us
on
a
high
wooded
bank
walking
rapidly
to
the
bend
near
which
we
were
obliged
to
sail
an
arrow
was
shot
at
the
foremost
boat
and
seeing
the
force
at
the
bend
we
pushed
out
from
the
side
as
far
as
the
shoal
water
would
permit
and
tried
to
bring
them
to
a
parley
by
declaring
that
we
had
not
come
to
fight
but
to
see
the
river
why
did
you
fire
a
gun
a
little
while
ago
they
asked
we
shot
a
large
puffadder
to
prevent
it
from
killing
men
you
may
see
it
lying
dead
on
the
beach
with
great
courage
our
mokadamo
waded
to
within
thirty
yards
of
the
bank
and
spoke
with
much
earnestness
assuring
them
that
we
were
a
peaceable
party
and
had
not
come
for
war
but
to
see
the
river
we
were
friends
and
our
countrymen
bought
cotton
and
ivory
and
wished
to
come
and
trade
with
them
all
we
wanted
was
to
go
up
quietly
to
look
at
the
river
and
then
return
to
the
sea
while
he
was
talking
with
those
on
the
shore
the
old
rogue
who
appeared
to
be
the
ringleader
stole
up
the
bank
and
with
a
dozen
others
waded
across
to
the
island
near
which
the
boats
lay
and
came
down
behind
us
wild
with
excitement
they
rushed
into
the
water
and
danced
in
our
rear
with
drawn
bows
taking
aim
and
making
various
savage
gesticulations
their
leader
urged
them
to
get
behind
some
snags
and
then
shoot
at
us
the
party
on
the
bank
in
front
had
many
musketsand
those
of
them
who
had
bows
held
them
with
arrows
ready
set
in
the
bowstrings
they
had
a
mass
of
thick
bush
and
trees
behind
them
into
which
they
could
in
a
moment
dart
after
discharging
their
muskets
and
arrows
and
be
completely
hidden
from
our
sight
a
circumstance
that
always
gives
people
who
use
bows
and
arrows
the
greatest
confidence
notwithstanding
these
demonstrations
we
were
exceedingly
loath
to
come
to
blows
we
spent
a
full
halfhour
exposed
at
any
moment
to
be
struck
by
a
bullet
or
poisoned
arrow
we
explained
that
we
were
better
armed
than
they
were
and
had
plenty
of
ammunition
the
suspected
want
of
which
often
inspires
them
with
courage
but
that
we
did
not
wish
to
shed
the
blood
of
the
children
of
the
same
great
father
with
ourselves
that
if
we
must
fight
the
guilt
would
be
all
theirs
this
being
a
common
mode
of
expostulation
among
themselves
we
so
far
succeeded
that
with
great
persuasion
the
leader
and
others
laid
down
their
arms
and
waded
over
from
the
bank
to
the
boats
to
talk
the
matter
over
this
was
their
river
they
did
not
allow
white
men
to
use
it
we
must
pay
toll
for
leave
to
pass
it
was
somewhat
humiliating
to
do
so
but
it
was
pay
or
fight
and
rather
than
fight
we
submitted
to
the
humiliation
of
paying
for
their
friendship
and
gave
them
thirty
yards
of
cloth
they
pledged
themselves
to
be
our
friends
ever
afterwards
and
said
they
would
have
food
cooked
for
us
on
our
return
we
then
hoisted
sail
and
proceeded
glad
that
the
affair
had
been
amicably
settled
those
on
shore
walked
up
to
the
bend
above
to
look
at
the
boat
as
we
supposed
but
the
moment
she
was
abreast
of
them
they
gave
us
a
volley
of
musketballs
and
poisoned
arrows
without
a
word
of
warning
fortunately
we
were
so
near
that
all
the
arrows
passed
clear
over
us
but
four
musketballs
went
through
the
sail
just
above
our
heads
all
our
assailants
bolted
into
the
bushes
and
long
grass
the
instant
after
firing
save
two
one
of
whom
was
about
to
discharge
a
musket
and
the
other
an
arrow
when
arrested
by
the
fire
of
the
second
boat
not
one
of
them
showed
their
faces
again
till
we
were
a
thousand
yards
away
a
few
shots
were
then
fired
over
their
heads
to
give
them
an
idea
of
the
range
of
our
rifles
and
they
all
fled
into
the
woods
those
on
the
sandbank
rushed
off
too
with
the
utmost
speed
but
as
they
had
not
shot
at
us
we
did
not
molest
them
and
they
went
off
safely
with
their
cloth
they
probably
expected
to
kill
one
of
our
number
and
in
the
confusion
rob
the
boats
it
is
only
where
the
people
are
slavers
that
the
natives
of
this
part
of
africa
are
bloodthirsty
these
people
have
a
bad
name
in
the
country
in
front
even
among
their
own
tribe
a
slavetrading
arab
we
met
above
thinking
we
were
then
on
our
way
down
the
river
advised
us
not
to
land
at
the
villages
but
to
stay
in
the
boats
as
the
inhabitants
were
treacherous
and
attacked
at
once
without
any
warning
or
provocation
our
experience
of
their
conduct
fully
confirmed
the
truth
of
what
he
said
there
was
no
trade
on
the
river
where
they
lived
but
beyond
that
part
there
was
a
brisk
canoe
trade
in
rice
and
salt
those
further
in
the
interior
cultivating
rice
and
sending
it
down
the
river
to
be
exchanged
for
salt
which
is
extracted
from
the
earth
in
certain
places
on
the
banks
our
assailants
hardly
anticipated
resistance
and
told
a
neighbouring
chief
that
if
they
had
known
who
we
were
they
would
not
have
attacked
english
who
can
bite
hard
they
offered
no
molestations
on
our
way
down
though
we
were
an
hour
in
passing
their
village
our
canoemen
plucked
up
courage
on
finding
that
we
had
come
off
unhurt
one
of
them
named
chiku
acknowledging
that
he
had
been
terribly
frightened
said
his
fear
was
not
the
kind
which
makes
a
man
jump
overboard
and
run
away
but
that
which
brings
the
heart
up
to
the
mouth
and
renders
the
man
powerless
and
no
more
able
to
fight
than
a
woman
in
the
country
of
chonga
michi
about
or
miles
up
the
river
we
found
decent
people
though
of
the
same
tribe
who
treated
strangers
with
civility
a
body
of
makoa
had
come
from
their
own
country
in
the
south
and
settled
here
the
makoa
are
known
by
a
cicatrice
in
the
forehead
shaped
like
the
new
moon
with
the
horns
turned
downwards
the
tribe
possesses
all
the
country
west
of
mosambique
and
they
will
not
allow
any
of
the
portuguese
to
pass
into
their
country
more
than
two
hours
distance
from
the
fort
a
hill
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
distant
called
pau
has
been
visited
during
the
present
generation
only
by
one
portuguese
and
one
english
officer
and
this
visit
was
accomplished
only
by
the
influence
of
the
private
friendship
of
a
chief
for
this
portuguese
gentleman
our
allies
have
occupied
the
fort
of
mosambique
for
three
hundred
years
but
in
this
as
in
all
other
cases
have
no
power
further
than
they
can
see
from
a
guncarriage
the
makoa
chief
matingula
was
hospitable
and
communicative
telling
us
all
he
knew
of
the
river
and
country
beyond
he
had
been
once
to
iboe
and
once
at
mosambique
with
slaves
our
men
understood
his
language
easily
a
useless
musket
he
had
bought
at
one
of
the
above
places
was
offered
us
for
a
little
cloth
having
received
a
present
of
food
from
him
a
railway
rug
was
handed
to
him
he
looked
at
ithad
never
seen
cloth
like
that
beforedid
not
approve
of
it
and
would
rather
have
cotton
cloth
but
this
will
keep
you
warm
at
nightoh
i
do
not
wish
to
be
kept
warm
at
nightwe
gave
him
a
bit
of
cotton
cloth
not
onethird
the
value
of
the
rug
but
it
was
more
highly
prized
his
people
refused
to
sell
their
fowls
for
our
splendid
prints
and
drab
cloths
they
had
probably
been
taken
in
with
gaudypatterned
sham
prints
before
they
preferred
a
very
cheap
plain
blue
stuff
of
which
they
had
experience
a
great
quantity
of
excellent
honey
is
collected
all
along
the
river
by
bark
hives
being
placed
for
the
bees
on
the
high
trees
on
both
banks
large
pots
of
it
very
good
and
clear
were
offered
in
exchange
for
a
very
little
cloth
no
wax
was
brought
for
sale
there
being
no
market
for
this
commodity
it
is
probably
thrown
away
as
useless
at
michi
we
lose
the
tableland
which
up
to
this
point
bounds
the
view
on
both
sides
of
the
river
as
it
were
with
ranges
of
flattopped
hills
or
feet
high
and
to
this
plateau
a
level
fertile
plain
succeeds
on
which
stand
detached
granite
hills
that
portion
of
the
tableland
on
the
right
bank
seems
to
bend
away
to
the
south
still
preserving
the
appearance
of
a
hill
range
the
height
opposite
extends
a
few
miles
further
west
and
then
branches
off
in
a
northerly
direction
a
few
small
pieces
of
coal
were
picked
up
on
the
sandbanks
showing
that
this
useful
mineral
exists
on
the
rovuma
or
on
some
of
its
tributaries
the
natives
know
that
it
will
burn
at
the
lakelet
chidia
we
noticed
the
same
sandstone
rock
with
fossil
wood
on
it
which
we
have
on
the
zambesi
and
knew
to
be
a
sure
evidence
of
coal
beneath
we
mentioned
this
at
the
time
to
captain
gardner
and
our
finding
coal
now
seemed
a
verification
of
what
we
then
said
the
coalfield
probably
extends
from
the
zambesi
to
the
rovuma
if
not
beyond
it
some
of
the
rocks
lower
down
have
the
permanent
waterline
three
feet
above
the
present
height
of
the
water
a
few
miles
west
of
the
makoa
of
matingula
we
came
again
among
the
makonde
but
now
of
good
repute
war
and
slavery
have
driven
them
to
seek
refuge
on
the
sandbanks
a
venerablelooking
old
man
hailed
us
as
we
passed
and
asked
us
if
we
were
going
by
without
speaking
we
landed
and
he
laid
down
his
gun
and
came
to
us
he
was
accompanied
by
his
brother
who
shook
hands
with
every
one
in
the
boat
as
he
had
seen
people
do
at
kilwa
then
you
have
seen
white
men
before
we
said
yes
replied
the
polite
african
but
never
people
of
your
quality
these
men
were
very
black
and
wore
but
little
clothing
a
young
woman
dressed
in
the
highest
style
of
makonde
fashion
punting
as
dexterously
as
a
man
could
brought
a
canoe
full
of
girls
to
see
us
she
wore
an
ornamental
headdress
of
red
beads
tied
to
her
hair
on
one
side
of
her
head
a
necklace
of
fine
beads
of
various
colours
two
bright
figured
brass
bracelets
on
her
left
arm
and
scarcely
a
farthings
worth
of
cloth
though
it
was
at
its
cheapest
as
we
pushed
on
westwards
we
found
that
the
river
makes
a
little
southing
and
some
reaches
were
deeper
than
any
near
the
sea
but
when
we
had
ascended
about
miles
by
the
rivers
course
from
the
sea
soft
tufa
rocks
began
to
appear
ten
miles
beyond
the
river
became
more
narrow
and
rocky
and
when
according
to
our
measurement
we
had
ascended
miles
our
further
progress
was
arrested
we
were
rather
less
than
two
degrees
in
a
straight
line
from
the
coast
the
incidents
worth
noticing
were
but
few
seven
canoes
with
loads
of
salt
and
rice
kept
company
with
us
for
some
days
and
the
further
we
went
inland
the
more
civil
the
people
became
when
we
came
to
a
stand
just
below
the
island
of
nyamatolo
long
degrees
minutes
e
and
lat
degrees
minutes
the
river
was
narrow
and
full
of
rocks
near
the
island
there
is
a
rocky
rapid
with
narrow
passages
fit
only
for
native
canoes
the
fall
is
small
and
the
banks
quite
low
but
these
rocks
were
an
effectual
barrier
to
all
further
progress
in
boats
previous
reports
represented
the
navigable
part
of
this
river
as
extending
to
the
distance
of
a
months
sail
from
its
mouth
we
found
that
at
the
ordinary
heights
of
the
water
a
boat
might
reach
the
obstructions
which
seem
peculiar
to
all
african
rivers
in
six
or
eight
days
the
rovuma
is
remarkable
for
the
high
lands
that
flank
it
for
some
eighty
miles
from
the
ocean
the
cataracts
of
other
rivers
occur
in
mountains
those
of
the
rovuma
are
found
in
a
level
part
with
hills
only
in
the
distance
far
away
in
the
west
and
north
we
could
see
high
blue
heights
probably
of
igneous
origin
from
their
forms
rising
out
of
a
plain
the
distance
from
ngomano

was
said
to
be
twelve
days
the

we
had
discovered
to

nyassa
by
murchisons
cataracts
had
so
much
less
land
carriage
that
we
considered
it
best
to
take
our
steamer
thither
by
the
route
in
which
we
were
well
known
instead
of
working
where
we
were
strangers
and
accordingly
we
made
up
our
minds
to
return
the
natives
reported
a
worse
place
above
our
turningpointthe
passage
being
still
narrower
than
this
an
arab
they
said
once
built
a
boat
above
the
rapids
and
sent
it
down
full
of
slaves
but
it
was
broken
to
pieces
in
these
upper
narrows
many
still
maintained
that
the
rovuma
came
from
nyassa
and
that
it
is
very
narrow
as
it
issues
out
of
the
lake
one
man
declared
that
he
had
seen
it
with
his
own
eyes
as
it
left
the
lake
and
seemed
displeased
at
being
crossquestioned
as
if
we
doubted
his
veracity
more
satisfactory
information
as
it
appeared
to
us
was
obtained
from
others
two
days
or
thirty
miles
beyond
where
we
turned
back
the
rovuma
is
joined
by
the
liende
which
coming
from
the
southwest
rises
in
the
mountains
on
the
east
side
of
nyassa
the
great

route
to
kilwa
runs
up
the
banks
of
this
river
which
is
only
ankledeep
at
the
dry
season
of
the
year
the
rovuma
itself
comes
from
the
wnw
and
after
the
traveller
passes
the
confluence
of
the
liende
at
ngomano

the

of

is
named

finds
the

crocodiles
in
the
rovuma
have
a
sorry
time
of
it
never
before
were
reptiles
so
persecuted
and
snubbed
they
are
hunted
with
spears
and
spring
traps
are
set
for
them
if
one
of
them
enters
an
inviting
pool
after
fish
he
soon
finds
a
fence
thrown
round
it
and
a
spring
trap
set
in
the
only
path
out
of
the
enclosure
their
flesh
is
eaten
and
relished
the
banks
on

the

our
men
were
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
crocodiles
nests
one
was
found
containing
thirtyfive
newlylaid
eggs
and
they
declared
that
the
crocodile
would
lay
as
many
more
the
second
night
in
another
place
the
eggs
were
a
foot
deep
in
the
sand
on
the
top
of
a
bank
ten
feet
high
the
animal
digs
a
hole
with
its
foot
covers
the
eggs
and
leaves
them
till
the
river
rises
over
the
nest
in
about
three
months
afterwards
when
she
comes
back
and
assists
the
young
ones
out
we
once
saw
opposite
tette
young
crocodiles
in
december
swimming
beside
an
island
in
company
with
an
old
one
the
yolk
of
the
egg
is
nearly
as
white
as
the
real
white
in
taste
they
resemble
hens
eggs
with
perhaps
a
smack
of
custard
and
would
be
as
highly
relished
by
whites
as
by

dark

now
roll
over
on

the

at

vast

lurid
flames
bursting

roaring

leap
wildly

above

the

and
amid

the

dancing
about
with
frantic
gesticulations
and
hurling

at

over

said
a
young
european
portuguese
they
do
nothing
and
are
always
wasting
their
time
in
suffering
or
in
recovering
from
fever
we
entered
the
zambesi
about
the
end
of
november
and
found
it
unusually
low
so
we
did
not
get
up
to
shupanga
till
the
th
of
december
the
friends
of
our
mazaro
men
who
had
now
become
good
sailors
and
very
attentive
servants
turned
out
and
gave
them
a
hearty
welcome
back
from
the
perils
of
the
sea
they
had
begun
to
fear
that
they
would
never
return
we
hired
them
at
a
sixteenyard
piece
of
cloth
a
monthabout
ten
shillings
worth
the
portuguese
marketprice
of
the
cloth
being
then
sevenpence
halfpenny

paid
them
five
pieces
each
for
four
andahalf
months
work
a
merchant
at
the
same
time
paid
other
mazaro
men
three
pieces
for
seven
months
and
they
were
with
him
in
the
interior
if
the
merchants
do
not
prosper
it
is
not
because
labour
is
dear
but
because
it
is
scarce
and
because
they
are
so
eager
on
every
occasion
to
sell
the
workmen
out
of
the
country
our
men
had
also
received
quantities
of
good
clothes
from
the
sailors
of
the
pioneer
and
of
the
orestes
and
were
now
regarded
by
their
neighbours
and
by
themselves
as
men
of
importance
never
before
had
they
possessed
so
much
wealth
they
believed
that
they
might
settle
in
life
being
now
of
sufficient
standing
to
warrant
their
entering
the
married
state
and
a
wife
and
a
hut
were
among
their
first
investments
sixteen
yards
were
paid
to
the
wifes
parents
and
a
hut
cost
four
yards
we
should
have
liked
to
have
kept
them
in
the
ship
for
they
were
wellbehaved
and
had
learned
a
great
deal
of
the
work
required
though
they
would
not
themselves
go
again
they
engaged
others
for
us
and
brought
twice
as
many
as
we
could
take
of
their
brothers
and
cousins
who
were
eager
to
join
the
ship
and
go
with
us
up
the
shire
or
anywhere
else
they
all
agreed
to
take
halfpay
until
they
too
had
learned
to
work
and
we
found
no
scarcity
of
labour
though
all
that
could
be
exported
is
now
out
of
the
country
there
had
been
a
drought
of
unusual
severity
during
the
past
season
in
the
country
between
lupata
and
kebrabasa
and
it
had
extended
northeast
to
the
manganja
highlands
all
the
tette
slaves
except
a
very
few
household
ones
had
been
driven
away
by
hunger
and
were
now
far
off
in
the
woods
and
wherever
wild
fruit
or
the
prospect
of
obtaining
anything
whatever
to
keep
the
breath
of
life
in
them
was
to
be
found
their
masters
were
said
never
to
expect
to
see
them
again
there
have
been
two
years
of
great
hunger
at
tette
since
we
have
been
in
the
country
and
a
famine
like
the
present
prevailed
in
when
thousands
died
of
starvation
if
men
like
the
cape
farmers
owned
this
country
their
energy
and
enterprise
would
soon
render
the
crops
independent
of
rain
there
being
plenty
of
slope
or
fall
the
land
could
be
easily
irrigated
from
the
zambesi
and
its
tributary
streams
a
portuguese
colony
can
never
prosper
it
is
used
as
a
penal
settlement
and
everything
must
be
done
military
fashion
what
do
i
care
for
this
country
said
the
most
enterprising
of
the
tette
merchants
all
i
want
is
to
make
money
as
soon
possible
and
then
go
to
bombay
and
enjoy
it
all
business
at
tette
was
now
suspended
carriers
could
not
be
found
to
take
the
goods
into
the
interior
and
the
merchants
could
barely
obtain
food
for
their
own
families
at
mazaro
more
rain
had
fallen
and
a
tolerable
crop
followed
the
people
of
shupanga
were
collecting
and
drying
different
wild
fruits
nearly
all
of
which
are
far
from
palatable
to
a
european
taste
the
root
of
a
small
creeper
called
bise
is
dug
up
and
eaten
in
appearance
it
is
not
unlike
the
small
white
sweet
potato
and
has
a
little
of
the
flavour
of
our
potato
it
would
be
very
good
if
it
were
only
a
little
larger
from
another
tuber
called
ulanga
very
good
starch
can
be
made
a
few
miles
from
shupanga
there
is
an
abundance
of
large
game
but
the
people
here
though
fond
enough
of
meat
are
not
a
hunting
race
and
seldom
kill
any
the
shire
having
risen
we
steamed
off
on
the
th
of
january
with
the
lady
nyassa
in
tow
it
was
not
long
before
we
came
upon
the
ravages
of
the
notorious
mariano
the
survivors
of
a
small
hamlet
at
the
foot
of
morambala
were
in
a
state
of
starvation
having
lost
their
food
by
one
of
his
marauding
parties
the
women
were
in
the
fields
collecting
insects
roots
wild
fruits
and
whatever
could
be
eaten
in
order
to
drag
on
their
lives
if
possible
till
the
next
crop
should
be
ripe
two
canoes
passed
us
that
had
been
robbed
by
marianos
band
of
everything
they
had
in
them
the
owners
were
gathering
palmnuts
for
their
subsistence
they
wore
palmleaf
aprons
as
the
robbers
had
stripped
them
of
their
clothing
and
ornaments
dead
bodies
floated
past
us
daily
and
in
the
mornings
the
paddles
had
to
be
cleared
of
corpses
caught
by
the
floats
during
the
night
for
scores
of
miles
the
entire
population
of
the
valley
was
swept
away
by
this
scourge
mariano
who
is
again
as
he
was
before
the
great
portuguese
slaveagent
it
made
the
heart
ache
to
see
the
widespread
desolation
the
riverbanks
once
so
populous
all
silent
the
villages
burned
down
and
an
oppressive
stillness
reigning
where
formerly
crowds
of
eager
sellers
appeared
with
the
various
products
of
their
industry
here
and
there
might
be
seen
on
the
bank
a
small
dreary
deserted
shed
where
had
sat
day
after
day
a
starving
fisherman
until
the
rising
waters
drove
the
fish
from
their
wonted
haunts
and
left
him
to
die
tingane
had
been
defeated
his
people
had
been
killed
kidnapped
and
forced
to
flee
from
their
villages
there
were
a
few
wretched
survivors
in
a
village
above
the
ruo
but
the
majority
of
the
population
was
dead
the
sight
and
smell
of
dead
bodies
was
everywhere
many
skeletons
lay
beside
the
path
where
in
their
weakness
they
had
fallen
and
expired
ghastly
living
forms
of
boys
and
girls
with
dull
dead
eyes
were
crouching
beside
some
of
the
huts
a
few
more
miserable
days
of
their
terrible
hunger
and
they
would
be
with
the
dead
oppressed
with
the
shocking
scenes
around
we
visited
the
bishops
grave
and
though
it
matters
little
where
a
good
christians
ashes
rest
yet
it
was
with
sadness
that
we
thought
over
the
hopes
which
had
clustered
around
him
as
he
left
the
classic
grounds
of
cambridge
all
now
buried
in
this
wild
place
how
it
would
have
torn
his
kindly
heart
to
witness
the
sights
we
now
were
forced
to
see
in
giving
vent
to
the
natural
feelings
of
regret
that
a
man
so
eminently
endowed
and
learned
as
was
bishop
mackenzie
should
have
been
so
soon
cut
off
some
have
expressed
an
opinion
that
it
was
wrong
to
use
an
instrument
so
valuable
merely
to
convert
the
heathen
if
the
attempt
is
to
be
made
at
all
it
is
penny
wise
and
pound
foolish
to
employ
any
but
the
very
best
men
and
those
who
are
specially
educated
for
the
work
an
ordinary
clergyman
however
well
suited
for
a
parish
will
not
without
special
training
make
a
missionary
and
as
to
their
comparative
usefulness
it
is
like
that
of
the
man
who
builds
an
hospital
as
compared
with
that
of
the
surgeon
who
in
after
years
only
administers
for
a
time
the
remedies
which
the
founder
had
provided
in
perpetuity
had
the
bishop
succeeded
in
introducing
christianity
his
converts
might
have
been
few
but
they
would
have
formed
a
continuous
roll
for
all
time
to
come
the
shire
fell
two
feet
before
we
reached
the
shallow
crossing
where
we
had
formerly
such
difficulty
and
we
had
now
two
ships
to
take
up
a
hippopotamus
was
shot
two
miles
above
a
bank
on
which
the
ship
lay
a
fortnight
it
floated
in
three
hours
as
the
boat
was
towing
it
down
the
crocodiles
were
attracted
by
the
dead
beast
and
several
shots
had
to
be
fired
to
keep
them
off
the
bullet
had
not
entered
the
brain
of
the
animal
but
driven
a
splinter
of
bone
into
it
a
little
moisture
with
some
gas
issued
from
the
wound
and
this
was
all
that
could
tell
the
crocodiles
down
the
stream
of
a
dead
hippopotamus
and
yet
they
came
up
from
miles
below
their
sense
of
smell
must
be
as
acute
as
their
hearing
both
are
quite
extraordinary
dozens
fed
on
the
meat
we
left
our
krooman
jumbo
used
to
assert
that
the
crocodile
never
eats
fresh
meat
but
always
keeps
it
till
it
is
high
and
tenderand
the
stronger
it
smells
the
better
he
likes
it
there
seems
to
be
some
truth
in
this
they
can
swallow
but
small
pieces
at
a
time
and
find
it
difficult
to
tear
fresh
meat
in
the
act
of
swallowing
which
is
like
that
of
a
dog
the
head
is
raised
out
of
the
water
we
tried
to
catch
some
and
one
was
soon
hooked
it
required
halfadozen
hands
to
haul
him
up
the
river
and
the
sharkhook
straightened
and
he
got
away
a
large
iron
hook
was
next
made
but
as
the
creatures
could
not
swallow
it
their
jaws
soon
pressed
it
straightand
our
crocodilefishing
was
a
failure
as
one
might
expectfrom
the
power
even
of
a
salmonthe
tug
of
a
crocodile
was
terribly
strong
the
corpse
of
a
boy
floated
past
the
ship
a
monstrous
crocodile
rushed
at
it
with
the
speed
of
a
greyhound
caught
it
and
shook
it
as
a
terrier
dog
does
a
rat
others
dashed
at
the
prey
each
with
his
powerful
tail
causing
the
water
to
churn
and
froth
as
he
furiously
tore
off
a
piece
in
a
few
seconds
it
was
all
gone
the
sight
was
frightful
to
behold
the
shire
swarmed
with
crocodiles
we
counted
sixtyseven
of
these
repulsive
reptiles
on
a
single
bank
but
they
are
not
as
fierce
as
they
are
in
some
rivers
crocodiles
says
captain
tuckey
are
so
plentiful
in
the
congo
near
the
rapids
and
so
frequently
carry
off
the
women
who
at
daylight
go
down
to
the
river
for
water
that
while
they
are
filling
their
calabashes
one
of
the
party
is
usually
employed
in
throwing
large
stones
into
the
water
outside
here
either
a
calabash
on
a
long
pole
is
used
in
drawing
water
or
a
fence
is
planted
the
natives
eat
the
crocodile
but
to
us
the
idea
of
tasting
the
muskyscented
fishylooking
flesh
carried
the
idea
of
cannibalism
humboldt
remarks
that
in
south
america
the
alligators
of
some
rivers
are
more
dangerous
than
in
others
alligators
differ
from
crocodiles
in
the
fourth
or
canine
tooth
going
into
a
hole
or
socket
in
the
upper
jaw
while
in
the
crocodile
it
fits
into
a
notch
the
forefoot
of
the
crocodile
has
five
toes
not
webbed
the
hindfoot
has
four
toes
which
are
webbed
in
the
alligator
the
web
is
altogether
wanting
they
are
so
much
alike
that
they
would
no
doubt
breed
together
one
of
the
crocodiles
which
was
shot
had
a
piece
snapped
off
the
end
of
his
tail
another
had
lost
a
forefoot
in
fighting
we
saw
actual
leeches
between
the
teeth
such
as
are
mentioned
by
herodotus
but
we
never
witnessed
the
plover
picking
them
out
their
greater
fierceness
in
one
part
of
the
country
than
another
is
doubtless
owing
to
a
scarcity
of
fish
in
fact
captain
tuckey
says
of
that
part
of
the
congo
mentioned
above
there
are
no
fish
here
but
catfish
and
we
found
that
the
lake
crocodiles
living
in
clear
water
and
with
plenty
of
fish
scarcely
ever
attacked
man
the
shire
teems
with
fish
of
many
different
kinds
the
only
time
as
already
remarked
when
its
crocodiles
are
particularly
to
be
dreaded
is
when
the
river
is
in
flood
then
the
fish
are
driven
from
their
usual
haunts
and
no
game
comes
down
to
the
river
to
drink
water
being
abundant
in
pools
inland
hunger
now
impels
the
crocodile
to
lie
in
wait
for
the
women
who
come
to
draw
water
and
on
the
zambesi
numbers
are
carried
off
every
year
the
danger
is
not
so
great
at
other
seasons
though
it
is
never
safe
to
bathe
or
to
stoop
to
drink
where
one
cannot
see
the
bottom
especially
in
the
evening
one
of
the
makololo
ran
down
in
the
dusk
of
the
river
and
as
he
was
busy
tossing
the
water
to
his
mouth
with
his
hand
in
the
manner
peculiar
to
the
natives
a
crocodile
rose
suddenly
from
the
bottom
and
caught
him
by
the
hand
the
limb
of
a
tree
was
fortunately
within
reach
and
he
had
presence
of
mind
to
lay
hold
of
it
both
tugged
and
pulled
the
crocodile
for
his
dinner
and
the
man
for
dear
life
for
a
time
it
appeared
doubtful
whether
a
dinner
or
a
life
was
to
be
sacrificed
but
the
man
held
on
and
the
monster
let
the
hand
go
leaving
the
deep
marks
of
his
ugly
teeth
in
it
during
our
detention
in
expectation
of
the
permanent
rise
of
the
river
in
march
dr
kirk
and
mr
c
livingstone
collected
numbers
of
the
wading
birds
of
the
marshesand
made
pleasant
additions
to
our
salted
provisions
in
geese
ducks
and
hippopotamus
flesh
one
of
the
comb
or
knobnosed
geese
on
being
strangled
in
order
to
have
its
skin
preserved
without
injury
continued
to
breathe
audibly
by
the
broken
humerus
or
wingbone
and
other
means
had
to
be
adopted
to
put
it
out
of
pain
this
was
as
if
a
man
on
the
gallows
were
to
continue
to
breathe
by
a
broken
armbone
and
afforded
us
an
illustration
of
the
fact
that
in
birds
the
vital
air
penetrates
every
part
of
the
interior
of
their
bodies
the
breath
passes
through
and
round
about
the
lungsbathes
the
surfaces
of
the
viscera
and
enters
the
cavities
of
the
bones
it
even
penetrates
into
some
spaces
between
the
muscles
of
the
neckand
thus
not
only
is
the
most
perfect
oxygenation
of
the
blood
secured
but
the
temperature
of
the
blood
being
very
high
the
air
in
every
part
is
rarefied
and
the
great
lightness
and
vigour
provided
for
that
the
habits
of
birds
require
several
birds
were
found
by
dr
kirk
to
have
marrow
in
the
tibiae
though
these
bones
are
generally
described
as
hollow
during
the
period
of
our
detention
on
the
shallow
part
of
the
river
in
march
mr
thornton
came
up
to
us
from
shupanga
he
had
as
before
narrated
left
the
expedition
in
and
joined
baron
van
der
decken
in
the
journey
to
kilimanjaro
when
by
an
ascent
of
the
mountain
to
the
height
of
feet
it
was
first
proved
to
be
covered
with
perpetual
snow
and
the
previous
information
respecting
it
given
by
the
church
of
england
missionaries
krapf
and
rebman
confirmed
it
is
now
well
known
that
the
baron
subsequently
ascended
the
kilimanjaro
to
feet
and
ascertained
its
highest
peak
to
be
at
least
feet
above
the
sea
mr
thornton
made
the
map
of
the
first
journey
at
shupanga
from
materials
collected
when
with
the
baron
and
when
that
work
was
accomplished
followed
us
he
was
then
directed
to
examine
geologically
the
cataract
district
but
not
to
expose
himself
to
contact
with
the
ajawa
until
the
feelings
of
that
tribe
should
be
ascertained
the
members
of
bishop
mackenzies
party
on
the
loss
of
their
head
fell
back
from
magomero
on
the
highlands
to
chibisas
in
the
lowlying
shire
valley
and
thornton
finding
them
suffering
from
want
of
animal
food
kindly
volunteered
to
go
across
thence
to
tette
and
bring
a
supply
of
goats
and
sheep
we
were
not
aware
of
this
step
to
which
the
generosity
of
his
nature
prompted
him
till
two
days
after
he
had
started
in
addition
to
securing
supplies
for
the
universities
mission
he
brought
some
for
the
expedition
and
took
bearings
by
which
he
hoped
to
connect
his
former
work
at
tette
with
the
mountains
in
the
shire
district
the
toil
of
this
journey
was
too
much
for
his
strength
as
with
the
addition
of
great
scarcity
of
water
it
had
been
for
that
of
dr
kirk
and
rae
and
he
returned
in
a
sadly
haggard
and
exhausted
condition
diarrhoea
supervened
and
that
ended
in
dysentery
and
fever
which
terminated
fatally
on
the
st
of
april
he
received
the
unremitting
attentions
of
dr
kirk
and
dr
meller
surgeon
of
the
pioneer
during
the
fortnight
of
his
illness
and
as
he
had
suffered
very
little
from
fever
or
any
other
disease
in
africa
we
had
entertained
strong
hopes
that
his
youth
and
unimpaired
constitution
would
have
carried
him
through
during
the
night
of
the
th
his
mind
wandered
so
much
that
we
could
not
ascertain
his
last
wishes
and
on
the
morning
of
the
st
to
our
great
sorrow
he
died
he
was
buried
on
the
nd
near
a
large
tree
on
the
right
bank
of
the
shire
about
five
hundred
yards
from
the
lowest
of
the
murchison
cataractsand
close
to
a
rivulet
at
which
the
lady
nyassa
and
pioneer
lay
no
words
can
convey
an
adequate
idea
of
the
scene
of
widespread
desolation
which
the
once
pleasant
shire
valley
now
presented
instead
of
smiling
villages
and
crowds
of
people
coming
with
things
for
sale
scarcely
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
and
when
by
chance
one
lighted
on
a
native
his
frame
bore
the
impress
of
hunger
and
his
countenance
the
look
of
a
cringing
brokenspiritedness
a
drought
had
visited
the
land
after
the
slavehunting
panic
swept
over
it
had
it
been
possible
to
conceive
the
thorough
depopulation
which
had
ensued
we
should
have
avoided
coming
up
the
river
large
masses
of
the
people
had
fled
down
to
the
shire
only
anxious
to
get
the
river
between
them
and
their
enemies
most
of
the
food
had
been
left
behind
and
famine
and
starvation
had
cut
off
so
many
that
the
remainder
were
too
few
to
bury
the
dead
the
corpses
we
saw
floating
down
the
river
were
only
a
remnant
of
those
that
had
perished
whom
their
friends
from
weakness
could
not
bury
nor
over
gorged
crocodiles
devour
it
is
true
that
famine
caused
a
great
portion
of
this
waste
of
human
life
but
the
slavetrade
must
be
deemed
the
chief
agent
in
the
ruin
because
as
we
were
informed
in
former
droughts
all
the
people
flocked
from
the
hills
down
to
the
marshes
which
are
capable
of
yielding
crops
of
maize
in
less
than
three
months
at
any
time
of
the
year
and
now
they
were
afraid
to
do
so
a
few
encouraged
by
the
mission
in
the
attempt
to
cultivate
had
their
little
patches
robbed
as
successive
swarms
of
fugitives
came
from
the
hills
who
can
blame
these
outcasts
from
house
and
home
for
stealing
to
save
their
wretched
lives
or
wonder
that
the
owners
protected
the
little
all
on
which
their
own
lives
depended
with
club
and
spear
we
were
informed
by
mr
waller
of
the
dreadful
blight
which
had
befallen
the
once
smiling
shire
valley
his
words
though
strong
failed
to
impress
us
with
the
reality
in
fact
they
were
received
as
some
may
accept
our
own
as
tinged
with
exaggeration
but
when
our
eyes
beheld
the
last
mere
driblets
of
this
cup
of
woe
we
for
the
first
time
felt
that
the
enormous
wrongs
inflicted
on
our
fellowmen
by
slaving
are
beyond
exaggeration
wherever
we
took
a
walk
human
skeletons
were
seen
in
every
direction
and
it
was
painfully
interesting
to
observe
the
different
postures
in
which
the
poor
wretches
had
breathed
their
last
a
whole
heap
had
been
thrown
down
a
slope
behind
a
village
where
the
fugitives
often
crossed
the
river
from
the
east
and
in
one
hut
of
the
same
village
no
fewer
than
twenty
drums
had
been
collected
probably
the
ferrymans
fees
many
had
ended
their
misery
under
shady
treesothers
under
projecting
crags
in
the
hillswhile
others
lay
in
their
huts
with
closed
doors
which
when
opened
disclosed
the
mouldering
corpse
with
the
poor
rags
round
the
loinsthe
skull
fallen
off
the
pillowthe
little
skeleton
of
the
child
that
had
perished
first
rolled
up
in
a
mat
between
two
large
skeletons
the
sight
of
this
desert
but
eighteen
months
ago
a
well
peopled
valley
now
literally
strewn
with
human
bones
forced
the
conviction
upon
us
that
the
destruction
of
human
life
in
the
middle
passage
however
great
constitutes
but
a
small
portion
of
the
waste
and
made
us
feel
that
unless
the
slavetradethat
monster
iniquity
which
has
so
long
brooded
over
africais
put
down
lawful
commerce
cannot
be
established
we
believed
that
if
it
were
possible
to
get
a
steamer
upon
the
lake
we
could
by
her
means
put
a
check
on
the
slavers
from
the
east
coast
and
aid
more
effectually
still
in
the
suppression
of
the
slavetrade
by
introducing
by
way
of
the
rovuma
a
lawful
traffic
in
ivory
we
therefore
unscrewed
the
lady
nyassa
at
a
rivulet
about
five
hundred
yards
below
the
first
cataract
and
began
to
make
a
road
over
the
thirty
five
or
forty
miles
of
land
portage
by
which
to
carry
her
up
piecemeal
after
mature
consideration
we
could
not
imagine
a
more
noble
work
of
benevolence
than
thus
to
introduce
light
and
liberty
into
a
quarter
of
this
fair
earth
which
human
lust
has
converted
into
the
nearest
possible
resemblance
of
what
we
conceive
the
infernal
regions
to
beand
we
sacrificed
much
of
our
private
resources
as
an
offering
for
the
promotion
of
so
good
a
cause
the
chief
part
of
the
labour
of
roadmaking
consisted
in
cutting
down
trees
and
removing
stones
the
country
being
covered
with
open
forest
a
small
tree
had
to
be
cut
about
every
fifty
or
sixty
yards
the
land
near
the
river
was
so
very
much
intersected
by
ravines
that
search
had
to
be
made
a
mile
from
its
banks
for
more
level
ground
experienced
hottentot
drivers
would
have
taken
cape
wagons
without
any
other
trouble
than
that
of
occasionally
cutting
down
a
tree
no
tsetse
infested
this
district
and
the
cattle
brought
from
johanna
flourished
on
the
abundant
pasture
the
first
halfmile
of
road
led
up
by
a
gradual
slope
to
an
altitude
of
two
hundred
feet
above
the
ship
and
a
sensible
difference
of
climate
was
felt
even
there
for
the
remainder
of
the
distance
the
height
increasedtill
at
the
uppermost
cataract
we
were
more
than
feet
above
the
sea
the
country
here
having
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
drought
was
bright
with
young
green
woodland
and
mountains
of
the
same
refreshing
hue
but
the
absence
of
the
crowds
which
had
attended
us
as
we
carried
up
the
boat
when
the
women
followed
us
for
miles
with
fine
meal
vegetables
and
fat
fowls
for
sale
and
the
boys
were
ever
ready
for
a
little
joband
the
oppressive
stillness
bore
heavily
on
our
spirits
the
portuguese
of
tette
had
very
effectually
removed
our
labourers
not
an
ounce
of
fresh
provisions
could
be
obtained
except
what
could
be
shot
and
even
the
food
for
our
native
crew
had
to
be
brought
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
zambesi
the
diet
of
salt
provisions
and
preserved
meats
without
vegetables
with
the
depression
of
spirits
caused
by
seeing
how
effectually
a
few
wretched
convicts
aided
by
the
connivance
of
officials
of
whom
better
might
have
been
hoped
could
counteract
our
best
efforts
and
turn
intended
good
to
certain
evil
brought
on
attacks
of
dysentery
which
went
the
round
of
the
expeditionand
dr
kirk
and
charles
livingstone
having
suffered
most
severely
it
was
deemed
advisable
that
they
should
go
home
this
measure
was
necessary
though
much
to
the
regret
of
allfor
having
done
so
much
they
were
naturally
anxious
to
be
present
when
by
the
establishing
ourselves
on
the
lake
all
our
efforts
should
be
crowned
with
success
after
it
had
been
decided
that
these
two
officers
and
all
the
whites
who
could
be
spared
should
be
sent
down
to
the
sea
for
a
passage
to
england
dr
livingstone
was
seized
in
may
with
a
severe
attack
of
dysentery
which
continued
for
a
month
and
reduced
him
to
a
shadow
dr
kirk
kindly
remained
in
attendance
till
the
worst
was
passed
the
parting
took
place
on
the
th
of
may
after
a
few
miles
of
road
were
completed
and
the
oxen
broken
in
we
resolved
to
try
and
render
ourselves
independent
of
the
south
for
fresh
provisions
by
going
in
a
boat
up
the
shire
above
the
cataracts
to
the
tribes
at
the
foot
of
lake
nyassa
who
were
still
untouched
by
the
ajawa
invasion
in
furtherance
of
this
plan
dr
livingstone
and
mr
rae
determined
to
walk
up
to
examine
and
if
need
be
mend
the
boat
which
had
been
left
two
seasons
previously
hung
up
to
the
limb
of
a
large
shady
tree
before
attempting
to
carry
another
past
the
cataracts
the
pioneer
which
was
to
be
left
in
charge
of
our
active
and
most
trustworthy
gunner
mr
edward
d
young
rn
was
thoroughly
roofed
over
with
euphorbia
branches
and
grass
so
as
completely
to
protect
her
decks
from
the
sun
she
also
received
daily
a
due
amount
of
manofwar
scrubbing
and
washing
and
besides
having
everything
put
in
shipshape
fashion
was
every
evening
swung
out
into
the
middle
of
the
river
for
the
sake
of
the
greater
amount
of
air
which
circulated
there
in
addition
to
their
daily
routine
work
of
the
ship
the
three
stokers
one
sailor
and
one
carpenternow
our
complementwere
encouraged
to
hunt
for
guineafowl
which
in
june
when
the
water
inland
is
dried
up
come
in
large
flocks
to
the
rivers
banks
and
roost
on
the
trees
at
night
everything
that
can
be
done
to
keep
mind
and
body
employed
tends
to
prevent
fever
while
we
were
employed
in
these
operations
some
of
the
poor
starved
people
about
had
been
in
the
habit
of
crossing
the
river
and
reaping
the
selfsown
mapira
in
the
old
gardens
of
their
countrymen
in
the
afternoon
of
the
th
a
canoe
came
floating
down
empty
and
shortly
after
a
woman
was
seen
swimming
near
the
other
side
which
was
about
two
hundred
yards
distant
from
us
our
native
crew
manned
the
boat
and
rescued
her
when
brought
on
board
she
was
found
to
have
an
arrowhead
eight
or
ten
inches
long
in
her
back
below
the
ribs
and
slanting
up
through
the
diaphragm
and
left
lung
towards
the
heartshe
had
been
shot
from
behind
when
stooping
air
was
coming
out
of
the
wound
and
there
being
but
an
inch
of
the
barbed
arrowhead
visible
it
was
thought
better
not
to
run
the
risk
of
her
dying
under
the
operation
necessary
for
its
removal
so
we
carried
her
up
to
her
own
hut
one
of
her
relatives
was
less
scrupulous
for
he
cut
out
the
arrow
and
part
of
the
lung
mr
young
sent
her
occasionally
portions
of
native
corn
and
strange
to
say
found
that
she
not
only
became
well
but
stout
the
constitution
of
these
people
seems
to
have
a
wonderful
power
of
selfrepairand
it
could
be
no
slight
privation
which
had
cut
off
the
many
thousands
that
we
saw
dead
around
us
we
regretted
that
in
consequence
of
dr
meller
having
now
sole
medical
charge
we
could
not
have
his
company
in
our
projected
trip
but
he
found
employment
in
botany
and
natural
history
after
the
annual
sickly
season
of
march
april
and
may
was
over
and
his
constant
presence
was
not
so
much
required
at
the
ship
later
in
the
year
when
he
could
be
well
spared
he
went
down
the
river
to
take
up
an
appointment
he
had
been
offered
in
madagascar
but
unfortunately
was
so
severely
tried
by
illness
while
detained
at
the
coast
that
for
nearly
two
years
he
was
not
able
to
turn
his
abilities
as
a
naturalist
to
account
by
proceeding
to
that
island
we
have
no
doubt
but
he
will
yet
distinguish
himself
in
that
untrodden
field
on
the
th
of
june
we
started
for
the
upper
cataracts
with
a
mulecart
our
road
lying
a
distance
of
a
mile
west
from
the
river
we
saw
many
of
the
deserted
dwellings
of
the
people
who
formerly
came
to
us
and
were
very
much
struck
by
the
extent
of
land
under
cultivation
though
that
compared
with
the
whole
country
is
very
small
large
patches
of
mapira
continued
to
growas
it
is
said
it
does
from
the
roots
for
three
years
the
mapira
was
mixed
with
tall
bushes
of
the
congobean
castoroil
plants
and
cotton
the
largest
patch
of
this
kind
we
paced
and
found
it
to
be
six
hundred
and
thirty
paces
on
one
sidethe
rest
were
from
one
acre
to
three
and
many
not
more
than
onethird
of
an
acre
the
cottonof
very
superior
qualitywas
now
dropping
off
the
bushes
to
be
left
to
rotthere
was
no
one
to
gather
what
would
have
been
of
so
much
value
in
lancashire
the
huts
in
the
different
villages
we
entered
were
standing
quite
perfect
the
mortars
for
pounding
cornthe
stones
for
grinding
itthe
water
and
beer
potsthe
empty
cornsafes
and
kitchen
utensils
were
all
untouched
and
most
of
the
doors
were
shut
as
if
the
starving
owners
had
gone
out
to
wander
in
search
of
roots
or
fruits
in
the
forest
and
had
never
returned
when
opened
several
huts
revealed
a
ghastly
sight
of
human
skeletons
some
were
seen
in
such
unnatural
positions
as
to
give
the
idea
that
they
had
expired
in
a
faint
when
trying
to
reach
something
to
allay
the
gnawings
of
hunger
we
took
several
of
the
men
as
far
as
the
mukurumadse
for
the
sake
of
the
change
of
air
and
for
occupation
and
also
to
secure
for
the
ships
a
supply
of
buffalo
meatas
those
animals
were
reported
to
be
in
abundance
on
that
stream
but
though
it
was
evident
from
the
tracks
that
the
report
was
true
it
was
impossible
to
get
a
glimpse
of
them
the
grass
being
taller
than
we
were
and
pretty
thickly
planted
they
always
knew
of
our
approach
before
we
saw
them
and
the
first
intimation
we
had
of
their
being
near
was
the
sound
they
made
in
rushing
over
the
stones
breaking
the
branches
and
knocking
their
horns
against
each
other
once
when
seeking
a
ford
for
the
cart
at
sunrise
we
saw
a
herd
slowly
wending
up
the
hillside
from
the
water
sending
for
a
rifle
and
stalking
with
intense
eagerness
for
a
fat
beefsteak
instead
of
our
usual
fare
of
salted
provisions
we
got
so
near
that
we
could
hear
the
bulls
uttering
their
hoarse
deep
low
but
could
see
nothing
except
the
mass
of
yellow
grass
in
front
suddenly
the
buffalobirds
sounded
their
alarm
whistle
and
away
dashed
the
troop
and
we
got
sight
of
neither
birds
nor
beasts
this
would
be
no
country
for
a
sportsman
except
when
the
grass
is
short
the
animals
are
wary
from
the
dread
they
have
of
the
poisoned
arrows
those
of
the
natives
who
do
hunt
are
deeply
imbued
with
the
hunting
spirit
and
follow
the
game
with
a
stealthy
perseverance
and
cunning
quite
extraordinary
the
arrow
making
no
noise
the
herd
is
followed
up
until
the
poison
takes
effect
and
the
wounded
animal
falls
out
it
is
then
patiently
watched
till
it
dropsa
portion
of
meat
round
the
wound
is
cut
away
and
all
the
rest
eaten
poisoned
arrows
are
made
in
two
pieces
an
iron
barb
is
firmly
fastened
to
one
end
of
a
small
wand
of
wood
ten
inches
or
a
foot
long
the
other
end
of
which
fined
down
to
a
long
point
is
nicely
fitted
though
not
otherwise
secured
in
the
hollow
of
the
reed
which
forms
the
arrow
shaft
the
wood
immediately
below
the
iron
head
is
smeared
with
the
poison
when
the
arrow
is
shot
into
an
animal
the
reed
either
falls
to
the
ground
at
once
or
is
very
soon
brushed
off
by
the
bushes
but
the
iron
barb
and
poisoned
upper
part
of
the
wood
remain
in
the
wound
if
made
in
one
piece
the
arrow
would
often
be
torn
out
head
and
all
by
the
long
shaft
catching
in
the
underwood
or
striking
against
trees
the
poison
used
here
and
called
kombi
is
obtained
from
a
species
of
strophanthus
and
is
very
virulent
dr
kirk
found
by
an
accidental
experiment
on
himself
that
it
acts
by
lowering
the
pulse
in
using
his
toothbrush
which
had
been
in
a
pocket
containing
a
little
of
the
poison
he
noticed
a
bitter
taste
but
attributed
it
to
his
having
sometimes
used
the
handle
in
taking
quinine
though
the
quantity
was
small
it
immediately
showed
its
power
by
lowering
his
pulse
which
at
the
time
had
been
raised
by
a
cold
and
next
day
he
was
perfectly
restored
not
much
can
be
inferred
from
a
single
case
of
this
kind
but
it
is
possible
that
the
kombi
may
turn
out
a
valuable
remedy
and
as
professor
sharpey
has
conducted
a
series
of
experiments
with
this
substance
we
look
with
interest
for
the
results
an
alkaloid
has
been
obtained
from
it
similar
to
strychnine
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
kinds
of
wild
animals
die
from
the
effects
of
poisoned
arrows
except
the
elephant
and
hippopotamus
the
amount
of
poison
that
this
little
weapon
can
convey
into
their
systems
being
too
small
to
kill
those
huge
beasts
the
hunters
resort
to
the
beam
trap
instead
another
kind
of
poison
was
met
with
on
lake
nyassa
which
was
said
to
be
used
exclusively
for
killing
men
it
was
put
on
small
wooden
arrowheads
and
carefully
protected
by
a
piece
of
maizeleaf
tied
round
it
it
caused
numbness
of
the
tongue
when
the
smallest
particle
was
tasted
the
bushmen
of
the
northern
part
of
the
kalahari
were
seen
applying
the
entrails
of
a
small
caterpillar
which
they
termed
nga
to
their
arrows
this
venom
was
declared
to
be
so
powerful
in
producing
delirium
that
a
man
in
dying
returned
in
imagination
to
a
state
of
infancy
and
would
call
for
his
mothers
breast
lions
when
shot
with
it
are
said
to
perish
in
agonies
the
poisonous
ingredient
in
this
case
may
be
derived
from
the
plant
on
which
the
caterpillar
feeds
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
by
what
sort
of
experiments
the
properties
of
these
poisons
known
for
generations
were
proved
probably
the
animal
instincts
which
have
become
so
obtuse
by
civilization
that
children
in
england
eat
the
berries
of
the
deadly
nightshade
atropa
belladonna
without
suspicion
were
in
the
early
uncivilized
state
much
more
keen
in
some
points
instinct
is
still
retained
among
savages
it
is
related
that
in
the
celebrated
voyage
of
the
french
navigator
bougainville
a
young
lady
who
had
assumed
the
male
attire
performed
all
the
hard
duties
incident
to
the
calling
of
a
common
sailor
and
even
as
servant
to
the
geologist
carried
a
bag
of
stones
and
specimens
over
hills
and
dales
without
a
complaint
and
without
having
her
sex
suspected
by
her
associates
but
on
landing
among
the
savages
of
one
of
the
south
sea
islands
she
was
instantly
recognized
as
a
female
they
began
to
show
their
impressions
in
a
way
that
compelled
her
to
confess
her
sex
and
throw
herself
on
the
protection
of
the
commander
which
of
course
was
granted
in
like
manner
the
earlier
portions
of
the
human
family
may
have
had
their
instincts
as
to
plants
more
highly
developed
than
any
of
their
descendantsif
indeed
much
more
knowledge
than
we
usually
suppose
be
not
the
effect
of
direct
revelation
from
above
the
mukurumadse
has
a
deep
rocky
bed
the
water
is
generally
about
four
feet
deep
and
fifteen
or
twenty
yards
broad
before
reaching
it
we
passed
five
or
six
gullies
but
beyond
it
the
country
for
two
or
three
miles
from
the
river
was
comparatively
smooth
the
long
grass
was
overrunning
all
the
native
paths
and
one
species
sanu
which
has
a
sharp
barbed
seed
a
quarter
of
an
inch
in
length
enters
every
pore
of
woollen
clothing
and
highly
irritates
the
skin
from
its
hard
sharp
point
a
series
of
minute
barbs
are
laid
back
and
give
the
seed
a
hold
wherever
it
enters
the
slightest
touch
gives
it
an
entering
motion
and
the
little
hooks
prevent
its
working
out
these
seeds
are
so
abundant
in
some
spots
that
the
inside
of
the
stocking
becomes
worse
than
the
roughest
hair
shirt
it
is
however
an
excellent
selfsower
and
fine
fodder
it
rises
to
the
height
of
common
meadowgrass
in
england
and
would
be
a
capital
plant
for
spreading
over
a
new
country
not
so
abundantly
supplied
with
grasses
as
this
is
we
have
sometimes
noticed
two
or
three
leaves
together
pierced
through
by
these
seeds
and
thus
made
as
it
were
into
wings
to
carry
them
to
any
soil
suited
to
their
growth
we
always
follow
the
native
paths
though
they
are
generally
not
more
than
fifteen
inches
broad
and
so
often
have
deep
little
holes
in
them
made
for
the
purpose
of
setting
traps
for
small
animals
and
are
so
much
obscured
by
the
long
grass
that
one
has
to
keep
ones
eyes
on
the
ground
more
than
is
pleasant
in
spite
however
of
all
drawbacks
it
is
vastly
more
easy
to
travel
on
these
tracks
than
to
go
straight
over
uncultivated
ground
or
virgin
forest
a
path
usually
leads
to
some
village
though
sometimes
it
turns
out
to
be
a
mere
game
track
leading
nowhere
in
going
north
we
came
into
a
part
called
mpemba
where
chibisa
was
owned
as
chief
but
the
people
did
not
know
that
he
had
been
assassinated
by
the
portuguese
terera
a
great
deal
of
grain
was
lying
round
the
hut
where
we
spent
the
night
very
large
numbers
of
turtledoves
feasted
undisturbed
on
the
tall
stalked
mapira
ears
and
we
easily
secured
plenty
of
fine
fat
guineafowlsnow
allowed
to
feed
leisurely
in
the
deserted
gardens
the
reason
assigned
for
all
this
listless
improvidence
was
there
are
no
women
to
grind
the
cornall
are
dead
the
cotton
patches
in
all
cases
seemed
to
have
been
so
well
cared
for
and
kept
so
free
of
weeds
formerly
that
though
now
untended
but
few
weeds
had
sprung
up
and
the
bushes
were
thus
preserved
in
the
annual
grass
burnings
many
baobabtrees
grow
in
different
spots
and
the
few
people
seen
were
using
the
white
pulp
found
between
the
seeds
to
make
a
pleasant
subacid
drink
on
passing
malango
near
the
uppermost
cataract
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
but
as
we
rested
opposite
a
beautiful
treecovered
island
the
merry
voices
of
children
at
play
fell
on
our
earsthe
parents
had
fled
thither
for
protection
from
the
slavehunting
ajawa
still
urged
on
by
the
occasional
visits
of
the
portuguese
agents
from
tette
the
ajawa
instead
of
passing
below
the
cataracts
now
avoided
us
and
crossed
over
to
the
east
side
near
to
the
tree
on
which
we
had
hung
the
boat
those
of
the
manganja
to
whom
we
could
make
ourselves
known
readily
came
to
us
but
the
majority
had
lost
all
confidence
in
themselves
in
each
other
and
in
every
one
else
the
boat
had
been
burned
about
three
months
previously
and
the
manganja
were
very
anxious
that
we
should
believe
that
this
had
been
the
act
of
the
ajawa
but
on
scanning
the
spot
we
saw
that
it
was
more
likely
to
have
caught
fire
in
the
grassburning
of
the
country
had
we
intended
to
be
so
long
in
returning
to
it
we
should
have
hoisted
it
bottom
upwards
for
as
it
was
it
is
probable
that
a
quantity
of
dried
leaves
lay
inside
and
a
spark
ignited
the
whole
all
the
trees
within
fifty
yards
were
scorched
and
killed
and
the
nails
iron
and
copper
sheathing
all
lay
undisturbed
beneath
had
the
ajawa
done
the
deed
they
would
have
taken
away
the
copper
and
iron
our
hopes
of
rendering
ourselves
independent
of
the
south
for
provisions
by
means
of
this
boat
being
thus
disappointed
we
turned
back
with
the
intention
of
carrying
another
up
to
the
same
spot
and
in
order
to
find
level
ground
for
this
we
passed
across
from
the
shire
at
malango
to
the
upper
part
of
the
stream
lesungwe
a
fine
active
intelligent
fellow
called
pekila
guided
us
and
was
remarkable
as
almost
the
only
one
of
the
population
left
with
any
spirit
in
him
the
depressing
effect
which
the
slavehunting
scourge
has
upon
the
native
mind
though
little
to
be
wondered
at
is
sad
very
sad
to
witness
musical
instruments
mats
pillows
mortars
for
pounding
meal
were
lying
about
unused
and
becoming
the
prey
of
the
white
ants
with
all
their
little
comforts
destroyed
the
survivors
were
thrown
still
further
back
into
barbarism
it
is
of
little
importance
perhaps
to
any
but
travellers
to
notice
that
in
occupying
one
night
a
wellbuilt
hut
which
had
been
shut
up
for
some
time
the
air
inside
at
once
gave
us
a
chill
and
an
attack
of
fever
both
of
which
vanished
when
the
place
was
wellventilated
by
means
of
a
fire
we
have
frequently
observed
that
lighting
a
fire
early
in
the
mornings
even
in
the
hottest
time
of
the
year
gives
freshness
to
the
whole
house
and
removes
that
feeling
of
closeness
and
langour
which
a
hot
climate
induces
on
the
night
of
the
st
july
several
loud
peals
of
thunder
awoke
us
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
and
not
a
cloud
to
be
seen
all
the
natives
remarked
on
the
clearness
of
the
sky
at
the
time
and
next
morning
said
we
thought
it
was
god
morungo
on
arriving
at
the
ship
on
the
nd
july
we
found
a
despatch
from
earl
russell
containing
instructions
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
expedition
the
devastation
caused
by
slavehunting
and
famine
lay
all
around
the
labour
had
been
as
completely
swept
away
from
the
great
shire
valley
as
it
had
been
from
the
zambesi
wherever
portuguese
intrigue
or
power
extended
the
continual
forays
of
mariano
had
spread
ruin
and
desolation
on
our
southeast
as
far
as
mount
clarendon
while
this
was
going
on
in
our
rear
the
tette
slavehunters
from
the
west
had
stimulated
the
ajawa
to
sweep
all
the
manganja
off
the
hills
on
our
east
and
slaving
parties
for
this
purpose
were
still
passing
the
shire
above
the
cataracts
in
addition
to
the
confession
of
the
governor
of
tette
of
an
intention
to
go
on
with
this
slaving
in
accordance
with
the
counsel
of
his
elder
brother
at
mosambique
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
slavery
went
on
under
the
eye
of
his
excellency
the
governorgeneral
himself
and
this
was
subsequently
corroborated
by
our
recognizing
two
women
at
mosambique
who
had
lived
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
missionstation
at
magomero
they
were
well
known
to
our
attendants
and
had
formed
a
part
of
a
gang
of
several
hundreds
taken
to
mosambique
by
the
ajawa
at
the
very
time
when
his
excellency
was
entertaining
english
officers
with
antislavery
palavers
to
any
one
who
understands
how
minute
the
information
is
which
portuguese
governors
possess
by
means
of
their
own
slaves
and
through
gossiping
traders
who
seek
to
curry
their
favour
it
is
idle
to
assert
that
all
this
slaving
goes
on
without
their
approval
and
connivance
if
more
had
been
wanted
to
prove
the
hopelessness
of
producing
any
change
in
the
system
which
has
prevailed
ever
since
our
allies
the
portuguese
entered
the
country
we
had
it
in
the
impunity
with
which
the
freebooter
terera
who
had
murdered
chibisa
was
allowed
to
carry
on
his
forays
belchoir
another
marauder
had
been
checked
but
was
still
allowed
to
make
war
as
they
term
slavehunting
mr
horace
waller
was
living
for
some
five
months
on
mount
morambala
a
position
from
which
the
whole
process
of
the
slavetrade
and
depopulation
of
the
country
around
could
be
well
noted
the
mountain
overlooks
the
shire
the
beautiful
meanderings
of
which
are
distinctly
seen
on
clear
days
for
thirty
miles
this
river
was
for
some
time
supposed
to
be
closed
against
mariano
who
as
a
mere
matter
of
form
was
declared
a
rebel
against
the
portuguese
flag
when
however
it
became
no
longer
possible
to
keep
up
the
sham
the
river
was
thrown
open
to
him
and
mr
waller
has
seen
in
a
single
day
from
fifteen
to
twenty
canoes
of
different
sizes
going
down
laden
with
slaves
to
the
portuguese
settlements
from
the
socalled
rebel
camp
these
cargoes
were
composed
entirely
of
women
and
children
for
three
months
this
traffic
was
incessant
and
at
last
so
completely
was
the
mask
thrown
off
that
one
of
the
officials
came
to
pay
a
visit
to
bishop
tozer
on
another
part
of
the
same
mountain
and
combining
business
with
pleasure
collected
payment
for
some
canoe
work
done
for
the
missionary
party
and
with
this
purchased
slaves
from
the
rebels
who
had
only
to
be
hailed
from
the
bank
of
the
river
when
he
had
concluded
the
bargain
he
trotted
the
slaves
out
for
inspection
in
mr
wallers
presence
this
official
senhor
mesquita
was
the
only
officer
who
could
be
forced
to
live
at
the
kongone
from
certain
circumstances
in
his
life
he
had
fallen
under
the
power
of
the
local
government
all
the
other
customhouse
officers
refused
to
go
to
kongone
so
here
poor
mesquita
must
live
on
a
miserable
pittancemust
live
and
perhaps
slave
sorely
against
his
will
his
name
is
not
brought
forward
with
a
view
of
throwing
any
odium
on
his
character
the
disinterested
kindness
which
he
showed
to
dr
meller
and
others
forbids
that
he
should
be
mentioned
by
us
with
anything
like
unkindness
under
all
these
considerations
with
the
fact
that
we
had
not
found
the
rovuma
so
favourable
for
navigation
at
the
time
of
our
visit
as
we
expected
it
was
impossible
not
to
coincide
in
the
wisdom
of
our
withdrawal
but
we
deeply
regretted
that
we
had
ever
given
credit
to
the
portuguese
government
for
any
desire
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
the
african
race
for
with
half
the
labour
and
expense
anywhere
else
we
should
have
made
an
indelible
mark
of
improvement
on
a
section
of
the
continent
viewing
portuguese
statesmen
in
the
light
of
the
laws
they
have
passed
for
the
suppression
of
slavery
and
the
slavetrade
and
by
the
standard
of
the
high
character
of
our
own
public
men
it
cannot
be
considered
weakness
to
have
believed
in
the
sincerity
of
the
anxiety
to
aid
our
enterprise
professed
by
the
lisbon
ministry
we
hoped
to
benefit
both
portuguese
and
africans
by
introducing
freetrade
and
christianity
our
allies
unfortunately
cannot
see
the
slightest
benefit
in
any
measure
that
does
not
imply
raising
themselves
up
by
thrusting
others
down
the
official
paper
of
the
lisbon
government
has
since
let
us
know
that
their
policy
was
directed
to
frustrating
the
grasping
designs
of
the
british
government
to
the
dominion
of
eastern
africa
we
who
were
on
the
spot
and
behind
the
scenes
knew
that
feelings
of
private
benevolence
had
the
chief
share
in
the
operations
undertaken
for
introducing
the
reign
of
peace
and
good
will
on
the
lakes
and
central
regions
which
for
ages
have
been
the
abodes
of
violence
and
bloodshed
but
that
great
change
was
not
to
be
accomplished
the
narrow
minded
would
ascribe
all
that
was
attempted
to
the
grasping
propensity
of
the
english
but
the
motives
that
actuate
many
in
england
both
in
public
and
private
life
are
much
more
noble
than
the
world
gives
them
credit
for
seeing
then
that
we
were
not
yet
arrived
at
the
good
time
coming
and
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
take
the
pioneer
down
to
the
sea
till
the
floods
of
december
we
made
arrangements
to
screw
the
lady
nyassa
together
and
in
order
to
improve
the
time
intervening
we
resolved
to
carry
a
boat
past
the
cataracts
a
second
time
sail
along
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
and
round
the
northern
end
and
also
collect
data
by
which
to
verify
the
information
collected
by
colonel
rigby
that
the
slaves
who
go
through
the
customhouse
of
zanzibar
annually
are
chiefly
drawn
from
lake
nyassa
and
the
valley
of
the
shire
our
party
consisted
of
twenty
natives
some
of
whom
were
johanna
men
and
were
supposed
to
be
capable
of
managing
the
six
oxen
which
drew
the
small
wagon
with
a
boat
on
it
a
team
of
twelve
cape
oxen
with
a
hottentot
driver
and
leader
would
have
taken
the
wagon
over
the
country
we
had
to
pass
through
with
the
greatest
ease
but
no
sooner
did
we
get
beyond
the
part
of
the
road
already
made
than
our
drivers
encountered
obstructions
in
the
way
of
trees
and
gullies
which
it
would
have
been
a
waste
of
time
to
have
overcome
by
felling
timber
and
hauling
out
the
wagon
by
block
and
tackle
purchases
the
ajawa
and
manganja
settled
at
chibisas
were
therefore
sent
for
and
they
took
the
boat
on
their
shoulders
and
carried
it
briskly
in
a
few
days
past
all
the
cataracts
except
one
then
coming
to
a
comparatively
still
reach
of
the
river
they
took
advantage
of
it
to
haul
her
up
a
couple
of
miles
the
makololo
had
her
then
entirely
in
charge
for
being
accustomed
to
rapids
in
their
own
country
no
better
boatmen
could
be
desired
the
river
here
is
very
narrow
and
even
in
what
are
called
still
places
the
current
is
very
strong
and
often
obliged
them
to
haul
the
boat
along
by
the
reeds
on
the
banks
or
to
hand
a
towrope
ashore
the
reeds
are
full
of
cowitch
dolichos
pruriens
the
pods
of
which
are
covered
with
what
looks
a
fine
velvety
down
but
is
in
reality
a
multitude
of
fine
prickles
which
go
in
by
the
million
and
caused
an
itching
and
stinging
in
the
naked
bodies
of
those
who
were
pulling
the
towrope
that
made
them
wriggle
as
if
stung
by
a
whole
bed
of
nettles
those
on
board
required
to
be
men
of
ready
resource
with
oars
and
puntingpoles
and
such
they
were
but
nevertheless
they
found
after
attempting
to
pass
by
a
rock
round
which
the
water
rushed
in
whirls
that
the
wiser
plan
would
be
to
take
the
boat
ashore
and
carry
her
past
the
last
cataract
when
this
was
reported
the
carriers
were
called
from
the
various
shady
trees
under
which
they
had
taken
refuge
from
the
sun
this
was

is
always

to
be
that
they
can
be

very
desirous
to
show
how
much
better
they
could

boat
than
the
makololo
three
jumped
into
her
when
our
backs
were
turned
and
two
hauled
her
up
a
little
way
the
tide
caught
her
bow
we
heard
a
shout
of
distress
the
rope
was
out
of
their
hands
in
a
moment
and
there
she
was
bottom
upwards
a
turn
or
two
in
an
eddy
and
away
she
went
like
an
arrow
down
the
cataracts
one
of
the
men
in
swimming
ashore
saved
a
rifle
the
whole
party
ran
with
all
their
might
along
the
bank
but
never
more
did
we
see
our
boat
the
five
performers
in
this
catastrophe
approached
with
penitential
looks
they
had
nothing
to
say
nor
had
we

bent
down
slowly
and
touched

feet

of
asking

it
was

to
bring
a

unbidden
to
its
papa
and
letting
it

burst
into
a
cry
of

they
were
only
sentenced
to
go
back
to
the
ship
get
provisions
and
in
the
ensuing
journey
on
foot
carry
as
much
as
they
could
and
thus
make
up
for
the
loss
of
the
boat
it
was
excessively
annoying
to
lose
all
this
property
and
be
deprived
of
the
means
of
doing
the
work
proposed
on
the
east
and
north
of

it
would
have
been
like
crying
over

do
otherwise

make
the
best

could

the
men
were

and

while
they
are
gone
we
may
say
a
little
of

heard
that
gushing
sound

from
the
interminable
windings
of
some
miles
of

we
had
come
to
believe
the

descend

on

through

we
were
startled
by
a
shocking
smell
like
that
of
a
dissecting
room
and
on
looking
up
saw
dead
bodies
in
mats
suspended
from
the
branches
of

a
mode
of
burial
somewhat
similar
to
that
which
we
subsequently
saw
practised
by
the

continually
hover

full
of

have
in

burst
through

highest
rock
seen
is
a
fine
sandstone
of
closer
grain
than
that
at

and
quite
metamorphosed

it
comes

side
we
pass
over
masses
of
porphyritic
trap
in
contact
with
the

mica
schists
and
these
probably
give
to
the
soil
the
great
fertility
we
observed
the
great
body
of
the
mountains
is
syenite
so
much
mica
is
washed
into

on
looking
attentively

one
sees
myriads
of
particles
floating
and
glancing
in

this
too
even
at

water
it
was
the
th
of
august
before
the
men
returned
from
the
ship
accompanied
by
mr
rae
and
the
steward
of
the
pioneer
they
brought
two
oxen
one
of
which
was
instantly
slaughtered
to
put
courage
into
all
hearts
and
some
bottles
of
wine
a
present
from
waller
and
alington
we
never
carried
wine
before
but
this
was
precious
as
an
expression
of
kindheartedness
on
the
part
of
the
donors
if
one
attempted
to
carry
either
wine
or
spirits
as
a
beverage
he
would
require
a
whole
troop
of
followers
for
nothing
else
our
greatest
luxury
in
travelling
was
tea
or
coffee
we
never
once
carried
sugar
enough
to
last
a
journey
but
coffee
is
always
good
while
the
sugarless
tea
is
only
bearable
because
of
the
unbearable
gnawing
feeling
of
want
and
sinking
which
ensues
if
we
begin
to
travel
in
the
mornings
without
something
warm
in
the
stomach
our
drink
generally
was
water
and
if
cool
nothing
can
equal
it
in
a
hot
climate
we
usually
carried
a
bottle
of
brandy
rolled
up
in
our
blankets
but
that
was
used
only
as
a
medicine
a
spoonful
in
hot
water
before
going
to
bed
to
fend
off
a
chill
and
fever
spirits
always
do
harm
if
the
fever
has
fairly
begun
and
it
is
probable
that
brandyand
water
has
to
answer
for
a
good
many
of
the
deaths
in
africa
mr
rae
had
made
gratifying
progress
in
screwing
together
the
lady
nyassa
he
had
the
zealous
cooperation
of
three
as
fine
steady
workmen
as
ever
handled
tools
and
as
they
were
noble
specimens
of
english
sailors
we
would
fain
mention
the
names
of
men
who
are
an
honour
to
the
british
navyjohn
reid
john
pennell
and
richard
wilson
the
reader
will
excuse
our
doing
so
but
we
desire
to
record
how
much
they
were
esteemed
and
how
thankful
we
felt
for
their
good
behaviour
the
weather
was
delightfully
cool
and
with
full
confidence
in
those
left
behind
it
was
with
light
hearts
we
turned
our
faces
north
mr
rae
accompanied
us
a
day
in
front
and
as
all
our
party
had
earnestly
advised
that
at
least
two
europeans
should
be
associated
together
on
the
journey
the
steward
was
at
the
last
moment
taken
mr
rae
returned
to
get
the
lady
nyassa
ready
for
sea
and
as
she
drew
less
water
than
the
pioneer
take
her
down
to
the
ocean
in
october
one
reason
for
taking
the
steward
is
worth
recording
both
he
and
a
man
named
king
who
though
only
a
leading
stoker
in
the
navy
had
been
a
promising
student
in
the
university
of
aberdeen
had
got
into
that
weak
bloodlesslooking
state
which
residence
in
the
lowlands
without
much
to
do
or
think
about
often
induces
the
best
thing
for
this
is
change
and
an
active
life
a
couple
of
days
march
only
as
far
as
the
mukurumadse
infused
so
much
vigour
into
king
that
he
was
able
to
walk
briskly
back
consideration
for
the
stewards
health
led
to
his
being
selected
for
this
northern
journey
and
the
measure
was
so
completely
successful
that
it
was
often
in
the
hard
march
a
subject
of
regret
that
king
had
not
been
taken
too
a
removal
of
only
a
hundred
yards
is
sometimes
so
beneficial
that
it
ought
in
severe
cases
never
to
be
omitted
our
object
now
was
to
get
away
to
the
nnw
proceed
parallel
with
lake
nyassa
but
at
a
considerable
distance
west
of
it
and
thus
pass
by
the
mazitu
or
zulus
near
its
northern
end
without
contactascertain
whether
any
large
river
flowed
into
the
lake
from
the
westvisit
lake
moelo
if
time
permitted
and
collect
information
about
the
trade
on
the
great
slave
route
which
crosses
the
lake
at
its
southern
end
and
at
tsenga
and
kotakota
the
makololo
were
eager
to
travel
fast
because
they
wanted
to
be
back
in
time
to
hoe
their
fields
before
the
rains
and
also
because
their
wives
needed
looking
after
in
going
in
the
first
instance
ne
from
the
uppermost
cataract
we
followed
in
a
measure
the
great
bend
of
the
river
towards
the
foot
of
mount
zomba
here
we
had
a
view
of
its
most
imposing
side
the
west
with
the
plateau
some
feet
high
stretching
away
to
its
south
and
mounts
chiradzuru
and
mochiru
towering
aloft
to
the
sky
from
that
goodly
highland
station
it
was
once
hoped
by
the
noble
mackenzie
who
for
largeness
of
heart
and
loving
disposition
really
deserved
to
be
called
the
bishop
of
central
africa
that
light
and
liberty
would
spread
to
all
the
interior
we
still
think
it
may
be
a
centre
for
civilizing
influences
for
any
one
descending
from
these
cool
heights
and
stepping
into
a
boat
on
the
upper
shire
can
sail
three
hundred
miles
without
a
check
into
the
heart
of
africa
we
passed
through
a
tract
of
country
covered
with
mopane
trees
where
the
hard
baked
soil
refused
to
let
the
usual
thick
crops
of
grass
grow
and
here
we
came
upon
very
many
tracks
of
buffaloes
elephants
antelopes
and
the
spoor
of
one
lion
an
ox
we
drove
along
with
us
as
provision
for
the
way
was
sorely
bitten
by
the
tsetse
the
effect
of
the
bite
was
as
usual
quite
apparent
two
days
afterwards
in
the
general
flaccidity
of
the
muscles
the
drooping
ears
and
looks
of
illness
it
always
excited
our
wonder
that
we
who
were
frequently
much
bitten
too
by
the
same
insects
felt
no
harm
from
their
attacks
man
shares
the
immunity
of
the
wild
animals
finding
a
few
people
on
the
evening
of
the
th
of
august
who
were
supporting
a
wretched
existence
on
tamarinds
and
mice
we
ascertained
that
there
was
no
hope
of
our
being
able
to
buy
food
anywhere
nearer
than
the
lakelet
pamalombe
where
the
ajawa
chief
kainka
was
now
living
but
that
plenty
could
be
found
with
the
maravi
female
chief
nyango
we
turned
away
northwestwards
and
struck
the
stream
ribveribve
or
rivi
rivi
which
rises
in
the
maravi
range
and
flows
into
the
shire
as
the
rivirivi
came
from
the
nw
we
continued
to
travel
along
its
banks
until
we
came
to
people
who
had
successfully
defended
themselves
against
the
hordes
of
the
ajawa
by
employing
the
men
of
one
village
to
go
forward
and
explain
who
we
were
to
the
next
we
managed
to
prevent
the
frightened
inhabitants
from
considering
us
a
fresh
party
of
ajawa
or
of
portuguese
slaving
agents
here
they
had
cultivated
maize
and
were
willing
to
sell
but
no
persuasion
could
induce
them
to
give
us
guides
to
the
chieftainess
nyango
they
evidently
felt
that
we
were
not
to
be
trusted
though
as
we
had
to
certify
to
our
own
character
our
companions
did
not
fail
to
blow
our
own
trumpet
with
blasts
in
which
modesty
was
quite
out
of
the
question
to
allay
suspicion
we
had
at
last
to
refrain
from
mentioning
the
ladys
name
it
would
be
wearisome
to
repeat
the
names
of
the
villages
we
passed
on
our
way
to
the
northwest
one
was
the
largest
we
ever
saw
in
africa
and
quite
deserted
with
the
usual
sad
sight
of
many
skeletons
lying
about
another
was
called
tette
we
know
three
places
of
this
name
which
fact
shows
it
to
be
a
native
word
it
seems
to
mean
a
place
where
the
water
rushes
over
rocks
a
third
village
was
called
chipanga
a
great
work
a
name
identical
with
the
shupanga
of
the
portuguese
this
repetition
of
names
may
indicate
that
the
same
people
first
took
these
epithets
in
their
traditional
passage
from
north
to
south
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
nights
are
still
cold
and
the
people
having
no
crops
to
occupy
their
attention
do
not
stir
out
till
long
after
the
sun
is
up
at
other
times
they
are
off
to
their
fields
before
the
day
dawns
and
the
first
sound
one
hears
is
the
loud
talking
of
men
and
women
in
which
they
usually
indulge
in
the
dark
to
scare
off
beasts
by
the
sound
of
the
human
voice
when
no
work
is
to
be
done
the
first
warning
of
approaching
day
is
the
hempsmokers
loud
ringing
cough
having
been
delayed
one
morning
by
some
negotiation
about
guides
who
were
used
chiefly
to
introduce
us
to
other
villages
we
two
whites
walked
a
little
way
ahead
taking
the
direction
of
the
stream
the
men
having
been
always
able
to
find
out
our
route
by
the
prints
of
our
shoes
we
went
on
for
a
number
of
miles
this
time
however
they
lost
our
track
and
failed
to
follow
us
the
path
was
well
marked
by
elephants
hyenas
pallahs
and
zebras
but
for
many
a
day
no
human
foot
had
trod
it
when
the
sun
went
down
a
deserted
hamlet
was
reached
where
we
made
comfortable
beds
for
ourselves
of
grass
firing
muskets
to
attract
the
attention
of
those
who
have
strayed
is
the
usual
resource
in
these
cases
on
this
occasion
the
sound
of
firearms
tended
to
mislead
us
for
hearing
shots
next
morning
a
long
weary
march
led
us
only
to
some
native
hunters
who
had
been
shooting
buffaloes
returning
to
a
small
village
we
met
with
some
people
who
remembered
our
passing
up
to
the
lake
in
the
boat
they
were
as
kind
as
they
could
be
the
only
food
they
possessed
was
tamarinds
prepared
with
ashes
and
a
little
cowitch
meal
the
cowitch
as
mentioned
before
has
a
velvety
brown
covering
of
minute
prickles
which
if
touched
enter
the
pores
of
the
skin
and
cause
a
painful
tingling
the
women
in
times
of
scarcity
collect
the
pods
kindle
a
fire
of
grass
over
them
to
destroy
the
prickles
then
steep
the
beans
till
they
begin
to
sprout
wash
them
in
pure
water
and
either
boil
them
or
pound
them
into
meal
which
resembles
our
beanmeal
this
plant
climbs
up
the
long
grass
and
abounds
in
all
reedy
parts
and
though
a
plague
to
the
traveller
who
touches
its
pods
it
performs
good
service
in
times
of
famine
by
saving
many
a
life
from
starvation
its
name
here
is
kitedzi
having
travelled
at
least
twenty
miles
in
search
of
our
party
that
day
our
rest
on
a
mat
in
the
best
hut
of
the
village
was
very
sweet
we
had
dined
the
evening
before
on
a
pigeon
each
and
had
eaten
only
a
handful
of
kitedzi
porridge
this
afternoon
the
good
wife
of
the
village
took
a
little
corn
which
she
had
kept
for
seed
ground
it
after
dark
and
made
it
into
porridge
this
and
a
cup
of
wild
vegetables
of
a
sweetish
taste
for
a
relish
a
little
boy
brought
in
and
put
down
with
several
vigorous
claps
of
his
hands
in
the
manner
which
is
esteemed
polite
and
which
is
strictly
enjoined
on
all
children
on
the
third
day
of
separation
akosanjere
the
headman
of
this
village
conducted
us
forward
to
our
party
who
had
gone
on
to
nseze
a
district
to
the
westward
this
incident
is
mentioned
not
for
any
interest
it
possesses
apart
from
the
idea
of
the
people
it
conveys
we
were
completely
separated
from
our
men
for
nearly
three
days
and
had
nothing
wherewith
to
purchase
food
the
people
were
sorely
pressed
by
famine
and
war
and
their
hospitality
poor
as
it
was
did
them
great
credit
and
was
most
grateful
to
us
our
own
men
had
become
confused
and
wandered
but
had
done
their
utmost
to
find
us
on
our
rejoining
them
the
ox
was
slain
and
all
having
been
on
short
commons
rejoiced
in
this
day
of
slaughter
akosanjere
was
of
course
rewarded
to
his
hearts
content
as
we
pursued
our
way
we
came
close
up
to
a
range
of
mountains
the
most
prominent
peak
of
which
is
called
mvai
this
is
a
great
bare
rounded
block
of
granite
shooting
up
from
the
rest
of
the
chain
it
and
several
other
masses
of
rock
are
of
a
light
grey
colour
with
white
patches
as
if
of
lichens
the
sides
and
summits
are
generally
thinly
covered
with
rather
scraggy
trees
there
are
several
other
prominent
peaksone
for
instance
still
further
north
called
chirobve
each
has
a
name
but
we
could
never
ascertain
that
there
was
an
appellation
which
applied
to
the
whole
this
fact
and
our
wish
to
commemorate
the
name
of
dr
kirk
induced
us
afterwards
when
we
could
not
discover
a
particular
peak
mentioned
to
us
formerly
as
molomoaokoku
or
cocksbill
to
call
the
whole
chain
from
the
west
of
the
cataracts
up
to
the
north
end
of
the
lake
kirks
range
the
part
we
slept
at
opposite
mvai
was
named
paudio
and
was
evidently
a
continuation
of
the
district
of
one
of
our
stations
on
the
shire
at
which
observations
for
latitude
were
formerly
taken
leaving
paudio
we
had
kirks
range
close
on
our
left
and
at
least
feet
above
us
and
probably
not
less
than
feet
above
the
sea
far
to
our
right
extended
a
long
green
wooded
country
rising
gradually
up
to
a
ridge
ornamented
with
several
detached
mountains
which
bounded
the
shire
valley
in
front
northwards
lay
a
valley
as
rich
and
lovely
as
we
ever
saw
anywhere
terminating
at
the
mountains
which
stretched
away
some
thirty
miles
beyond
our
range
of
vision
and
ended
at
cape
maclear
the
groups
of
trees
had
never
been
subjected
to
the
landscape
gardeners
art
but
had
been
cut
down
mercilessly
just
as
suited
the
convenience
of
the
cultivator
yet
the
various
combinations
of
open
forest
sloping
woodland
grassy
lawns
and
massive
clumps
of
dark
green
foliage
along
the
running
streams
formed
as
beautiful
a
landscape
as
could
be
seen
on
the
thames
this
valley
is
named
goa
or
gova
and
as
we
moved
through
it
we
found
that
what
was
smooth
to
the
eye
was
very
much
furrowed
by
running
streams
winding
round
innumerable
knolls
these
little
brooklets
came
down
from
the
range
on
our
left
and
the
water
was
deliciously
cool
when
we
came
abreast
of
the
peak
chirobve
the
people
would
no
longer
give
us
guides
they
were
afraid
of
their
enemies
whose
dwellings
we
now
had
on
our
east
and
proceeding
without
any
one
to
lead
us
or
to
introduce
us
to
the
inhabitants
we
were
perplexed
by
all
the
paths
running
zigzag
across
instead
of
along
the
valley
they
had
been
made
by
the
villagers
going
from
the
hamlets
on
the
slopes
to
their
gardens
in
the
meadows
below
to
add
to
our
difficulties
the
rivulets
and
mountain
torrents
had
worn
gullies
some
thirty
or
forty
feet
deep
with
steep
sides
that
could
not
be
climbed
except
at
certain
points
the
remaining
inhabitants
on
the
flank
of
the
range
when
they
saw
strangers
winding
from
side
to
side
and
often
attempting
to
cross
these
torrent
beds
at
impossible
places
screamed
out
their
shrill
waralarm
and
made
the
valley
ring
with
their
wild
outcries
it
was
war
and
war
alone
and
we
were
too
deep
down
in
the
valley
to
make
our
voices
heard
in
explanation
fortunately
they
had
burned
off
the
long
grass
to
a
great
extent
it
only
here
and
there
hid
them
from
us
selecting
an
open
spot
we
spent
a
night
regarded
by
all
around
us
as
slavehunters
but
were
undisturbed
though
the
usual
way
of
treating
an
enemy
in
this
part
of
the
country
is
by
night
attack
the
nights
at
the
altitude
of
the
valley
were
cool
the
lowest
temperature
shown
being
degrees
at
am
and
pm
it
was
degrees
about
the
average
temperature
of
the
day
at
midday
degrees
and
sunset
degrees
our
march
was
very
much
hindered
by
the
imperfectly
burned
corn
and
grass
stalks
having
fallen
across
the
paths
to
a
reader
in
england
this
will
seem
a
very
small
obstacle
but
he
must
fancy
the
grass
stems
as
thick
as
his
little
finger
and
the
cornstalks
like
so
many
walkingsticks
lying
in
one
direction
and
so
supporting
each
other
that
one
has
to
lift
his
feet
up
as
when
wading
through
deep
high
heather
the
stems
of
grass
showed
the
causes
of
certain
explosions
as
loud
as
pistols
which
are
heard
when
the
annual
fires
come
roaring
over
the
land
the
heated
air
inside
expanding
bursts
the
stalk
with
a
loud
report
and
strews
the
fragments
on
the
ground
a
very
great
deal
of
native
corn
had
been
cultivated
here
and
we
saw
buffaloes
feeding
in
the
deserted
gardens
and
some
women
who
ran
away
very
much
faster
than
the
beasts
did
on
the
th
seeing
some
people
standing
under
a
tree
by
a
village
we
sat
down
and
sent
masego
one
of
our
party
to
communicate
the
headman
matunda
came
back
with
him
bearing
a
calabash
with
water
for
us
he
said
that
all
the
people
had
fled
from
the
ajawa
who
had
only
just
desisted
from
their
career
of
pillage
on
being
paid
five
persons
as
a
fine
for
some
offence
for
which
they
had
commenced
the
invasion
matunda
had
plenty
of
grain
to
sell
and
all
the
women
were
soon
at
work
grinding
it
into
meal
we
secured
an
abundant
supply
and
four
milk
goats
the
manganja
goat
is
of
a
very
superior
breed
to
the
general
african
animal
being
short
in
the
legs
and
having
a
finelyshaped
broad
body
by
promising
the
makololo
that
when
we
no
longer
needed
the
milk
they
should
have
the
goats
to
improve
the
breed
of
their
own
at
home
they
were
induced
to
take
the
greatest
possible
care
of
both
goats
and
kids
in
driving
and
pasturing
after
leaving
matunda
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
highland
valley
and
before
descending
a
steep
declivity
of
a
thousand
feet
towards
the
part
which
may
be
called
the
heel
of
the
lake
we
had
the
bold
mountains
of
cape
maclear
on
our
right
with
the
blue
water
at
their
base
the
hills
of
tsenga
in
the
distance
in
front
and
kirks
range
on
our
left
stretching
away
northwards
and
apparently
becoming
lower
as
we
came
down
into
a
fine
rich
undulating
valley
many
perennial
streams
running
to
the
east
from
the
hills
on
our
left
were
crossed
while
all
those
behind
us
on
the
higher
ground
seemed
to
unite
in
one
named
lekue
which
flowed
into
the
lake
after
a
long
days
march
in
the
valley
of
the
lake
where
the
temperature
was
very
much
higher
than
in
that
we
had
just
left
we
entered
the
village
of
katosa
which
is
situated
on
the
bank
of
a
stream
among
gigantic
timber
trees
and
found
there
a
large
party
of
ajawawaiau
they
called
themselvesall
armed
with
muskets
we
sat
down
among
them
and
were
soon
called
to
the
chiefs
court
and
presented
with
an
ample
mess
of
porridge
buffalo
meat
and
beer
katosa
was
more
frank
than
any
manganja
chief
we
had
met
and
complimented
us
by
saying
that
we
must
be
his
bazimo
good
spirits
of
his
ancestors
for
when
he
lived
at
pamalombe
we
lighted
upon
him
from
abovemen
the
like
of
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
and
coming
he
knew
not
whence
he
gave
us
one
of
his
own
large
and
clean
huts
to
sleep
in
and
we
may
take
this
opportunity
of
saying
that
the
impression
we
received
from
our
first
journey
on
the
hills
among
the
villages
of
chisunse
of
the
excessive
dirtiness
of
the
manganja
was
erroneous
this
trait
was
confined
to
the
cool
highlands
here
crowds
of
men
and
women
were
observed
to
perform
their
ablutions
daily
in
the
stream
that
ran
past
their
villages
and
this
we
have
observed
elsewhere
to
be
a
common
custom
with
both
manganja
and
ajawa
before
we
started
on
the
morning
of
the
st
september
katosa
sent
an
enormous
calabash
of
beer
containing
at
least
three
gallons
and
then
came
and
wished
us
to
stop
a
day
and
eat
with
him
on
explaining
to
him
the
reasons
for
our
haste
he
said
that
he
was
in
the
way
by
which
travellers
usually
passed
he
never
stopped
them
in
their
journeys
but
would
like
to
look
at
us
for
a
day
on
our
promising
to
rest
a
little
with
him
on
our
return
he
gave
us
about
two
pecks
of
rice
and
three
guides
to
conduct
us
to
a
subordinate
female
chief
nkwinda
living
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
in
front
the
ajawa
from
having
taken
slaves
down
to
quillimane
and
mosambique
knew
more
of
us
than
katosa
did
their
muskets
were
carefully
polished
and
never
out
of
these
slavers
hands
for
a
moment
though
in
the
chiefs
presence
we
naturally
felt
apprehensive
that
we
should
never
see
katosa
again
a
migratory
afflatus
seems
to
have
come
over
the
ajawa
tribes
wars
among
themselves
for
the
supply
of
the
coast
slavetrade
are
said
to
have
first
set
them
in
motion
the
usual
way
in
which
they
have
advanced
among
the
manganja
has
been
by
slavetrading
in
a
friendly
way
then
professing
to
wish
to
live
as
subjects
they
have
been
welcomed
as
guests
and
the
manganja
being
great
agriculturists
have
been
able
to
support
considerable
bodies
of
these
visitors
for
a
time
when
the
provisions
became
scarce
the
guests
began
to
steal
from
the
fields
quarrels
arose
in
consequence
and
the
ajawa
having
firearms
their
hosts
got
the
worst
of
it
and
were
expelled
from
village
after
village
and
out
of
their
own
country
the
manganja
were
quite
as
bad
in
regard
to
slavetrading
as
the
ajawa
but
had
less
enterprise
and
were
much
more
fond
of
the
home
pursuits
of
spinning
weaving
smelting
iron
and
cultivating
the
soil
than
of
foreign
travel
the
ajawa
had
little
of
a
mechanical
turn
and
not
much
love
for
agriculture
but
were
very
keen
traders
and
travellers
this
party
seemed
to
us
to
be
in
the
first
or
friendly
stage
of
intercourse
with
katosa
and
as
we
afterwards
found
he
was
fully
alive
to
the
danger
our
course
was
shaped
towards
the
nw
and
we
traversed
a
large
fertile
tract
of
rich
soil
extensively
cultivated
but
dotted
with
many
gigantic
thorny
acacias
which
had
proved
too
large
for
the
little
axes
of
the
cultivators
after
leaving
nkwinda
the
first
village
we
spent
a
night
at
in
the
district
ngabi
was
that
of
chembi
and
it
had
a
stockade
around
it
the
azitu
or
mazitu
were
said
to
be
ravaging
the
country
to
the
west
of
us
and
no
one
was
safe
except
in
a
stockade
we
have
so
often
in
travelling
heard
of
war
in
front
that
we
paid
little
attention
to
the
assertion
of
chembi
that
the
whole
country
to
the
nw
was
in
flight
before
these
mazitu
under
a
chief
with
the
rather
formidable
name
of
mowhiriwhiri
we
therefore
resolved
to
go
on
to
chinsambas
still
further
in
the
same
direction
and
hear
what
he
said
about
it
the
only
instrument
of
husbandry
here
is
the
shorthandled
hoe
and
about
tette
the
labour
of
tilling
the
soil
as
represented
in
the
woodcut
is
performed
entirely
by
female
slaves
on
the
west
coast
a
doublehandled
hoe
is
employed
here
the
small
hoe
is
seen
in
the
hands
of
both
men
and
women
in
other
parts
of
africa
a
hoe
with
a
handle
four
feet
long
is
used
but
the
plough
is
quite
unknown
in
illustration
of
the
manner
in
which
the
native
knowledge
of
agriculture
strikes
an
honest
intelligent
observer
it
may
be
mentioned
that
the
first
time
good
bishop
mackenzie
beheld
how
well
the
fields
of
the
manganja
were
cultivated
on
the
hills
he
remarked
to
dr
livingstone
then
his
fellowtravellerwhen
telling
the
people
in
england
what
were
my
objects
in
going
out
to
africa
i
stated
that
among
other
things
i
meant
to
teach
these
people
agriculture
but
i
now
see
that
they
know
far
more
about
it
than
i
do
this
we
take
it
was
an
honest
straightforward
testimony
and
we
believe
that
every
unprejudiced
witness
who
has
an
opportunity
of
forming
an
opinion
of
africans
who
have
never
been
debased
by
slavery
will
rank
them
very
much
higher
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
industry
and
manhood
than
others
who
know
them
only
in
a
state
of
degradation
on
coming
near
chinsambas
two
stockades
on
the
banks
of
the
lintipe
we
were
told
that
the
mazitu
had
been
repulsed
there
the
day
before
and
we
had
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
report
of
the
attack
in
the
sad
sight
of
the
bodies
of
the
slain
the
zulus
had
taken
off
large
numbers
of
women
laden
with
corn
and
when
driven
back
had
cut
off
the
ears
of
a
male
prisoner
as
a
sort
of
credential
that
he
had
been
with
the
mazitu
and
with
grim
humour
sent
him
to
tell
chinsamba
to
take
good
care
of
the
corn
in
the
stockades
for
they
meant
to
return
for
it
in
a
month
or
two
chinsambas
people
were
drumming
with
might
and
main
on
our
arrival
to
express
their
joy
at
their
deliverance
from
the
mazitu
the
drum
is
the
chief
instrument
of
music
among
the
manganja
and
with
it
they
express
both
their
joy
and
grief
they
excel
in
beating
time
chinsamba
called
us
into
a
very
large
hut
and
presented
us
with
a
huge
basket
of
beer
the
glare
of
sunlight
from
which
we
had
come
enabled
him
in
diplomatic
fashion
to
have
a
good
view
of
us
before
our
eyes
became
enough
accustomed
to
the
dark
inside
to
see
him
he
has
a
jewish
cast
of
countenance
or
rather
the
ancient
assyrian
face
as
seen
in
the
monuments
brought
to
the
british
museum
by
mr
layard
this
form
of
face
is
very
common
in
this
country
and
leads
to
the
belief
that
the
true
type
of
the
negro
is
not
that
met
on
the
west
coast
from
which
most
people
have
derived
their
ideas
of
the
african
chinsamba
had
many
abisa
or
babisa
in
his
stockade
and
it
was
chiefly
by
the
help
of
their
muskets
that
he
had
repulsed
the
mazitu
these
babisa
are
great
travellers
and
traders
we
liked
chinsamba
very
well
and
found
that
he
was
decidedly
opposed
to
our
risking
our
lives
by
going
further
to
the
nw
the
mazitu
were
believed
to
occupy
all
the
hills
in
that
direction
so
we
spent
the
th
of
september
with
him
it
is
rather
a
minute
thing
to
mention
and
it
will
only
be
understood
by
those
who
have
children
of
their
own
but
the
cries
of
the
little
ones
in
their
infant
sorrows
are
the
same
in
tone
at
different
ages
here
as
all
over
the
world
we
have
been
perpetually
reminded
of
home
and
family
by
the
wailings
which
were
once
familiar
to
parental
ears
and
heart
and
felt
thankful
that
to
the
sorrows
of
childhood
our
children
would
never
have
superadded
the
heartrending
woes
of
the
slavetrade
taking
chinsambas
advice
to
avoid
the
mazitu
in
their
marauding
we
started
on
the
th
september
away
to
the
ne
and
passed
mile
after
mile
of
native
cornfields
with
an
occasional
cottonpatch
after
a
long
march
we
passed
over
a
waterless
plain
about
nnw
of
the
hills
of
tsenga
to
a
village
on
the
lake
and
thence
up
its
shores
to
chitanda
the
banks
of
the
lake
were
now
crowded
with
fugitives
who
had
collected
there
for
the
poor
protection
which
the
reeds
afforded
for
miles
along
the
waters
edge
was
one
continuous
village
of
temporary
huts
the
people
had
brought
a
little
corn
with
them
but
they
said
what
shall
we
eat
when
that
is
done
when
we
plant
corn
the
wild
beasts
zinyama
as
they
call
the
mazitu
come
and
take
it
when
we
plant
cassava
they
do
the
same
how
are
we
to
live
a
poor
blind
woman
thinking
we
were
mazitu
rushed
off
in
front
of
us
with
outspread
arms
lifting
the
feet
high
in
the
manner
peculiar
to
those
who
have
lost
their
sight
and
jumped
into
the
reeds
of
a
stream
for
safety
in
our
way
along
the
shores
we
crossed
several
running
rivulets
of
clear
cold
water
which
from
having
reeds
at
their
confluences
had
not
been
noticed
in
our
previous
exploration
in
the
boat
one
of
these
was
called
mokola
and
another
had
a
strong
odour
of
sulphuretted
hydrogen
we
reached
molamba
on
the
th
september
and
found
our
old
acquaintance
nkomo
there
still
one
of
the
advantages
of
travelling
along
the
shores
of
the
lake
was
that
we
could
bathe
anywhere
in
its
clear
fresh
water
to
us
who
had
been
obliged
so
often
to
restrain
our
inclination
in
the
zambesi
and
shire
for
fear
of
crocodiles
this
was
pleasant
beyond
measure
the
water
now
was
of
the
same
temperature
as
it
was
on
our
former
visit
or
degrees
fahr
the
immense
depth
of
the
lake
prevents
the
rays
of
the
sun
from
raising
the
temperature
as
high
as
that
of
the
shire
and
zambesi
and
the
crocodiles
having
always
clear
water
in
the
lake
and
abundance
of
fish
rarely
attack
man
many
of
these
reptiles
could
be
seen
basking
on
the
rocks
a
days
march
beyond
molamba
brought
us
to
the
lakelet
chia
which
lies
parallel
with
the
lake
it
is
three
or
four
miles
long
by
from
one
to
one
and
a
half
broad
and
communicates
with
the
lake
by
an
arm
of
good
depth
but
with
some
rocks
in
it
as
we
passed
up
between
the
lake
and
the
eastern
shore
of
this
lakelet
we
did
not
see
any
streams
flowing
into
it
it
is
quite
remarkable
for
the
abundance
of
fish
and
we
saw
upwards
of
fifty
large
canoes
engaged
in
the
fishery
which
is
carried
on
by
means
of
handnets
with
sideframe
poles
about
seven
feet
long
these
nets
are
nearly
identical
with
those
now
in
use
in
normandythe
difference
being
that
the
african
net
has
a
piece
of
stick
lashed
across
the
handleends
of
the
side
poles
to
keep
them
steady
which
is
a
great
improvement
the
fish
must
be
very
abundant
to
be
scooped
out
of
the
water
in
such
quantities
as
we
saw
and
by
so
many
canoes
there
is
quite
a
trade
here
in
dried
fish
the
country
around
is
elevated
undulating
and
very
extensively
planted
with
cassava
the
hoe
in
use
has
a
handle
of
four
feet
in
length
and
the
iron
part
is
exactly
of
the
same
form
as
that
in
the
country
of
the
bechuanas
the
baskets
here
which
are
so
closely
woven
together
as
to
hold
beer
are
the
same
with
those
employed
to
hold
milk
in
kaffirlanda
thousand
miles
distant
marching
on
foot
is
peculiarly
conducive
to
meditationone
is
glad
of
any
subject
to
occupy
the
mind
and
relieve
the
monotony
of
the
weary
treadmilllike
trudgetrudging
this
chia
net
brought
to
our
mind
that
the
smiths
bellows
made
here
of
a
goatskin
bag
with
sticks
along
the
open
ends
are
the
same
as
those
in
use
in
the
bechuana
country
far
to
the
southwest
these
with
the
longhandled
hoe
may
only
show
that
each
successive
horde
from
north
to
south
took
inventions
with
it
from
the
same
original
source
where
that
source
may
have
been
is
probably
indicated
by
another
pair
of
bellows
which
we
observed
below
the
victoria
falls
being
found
in
central
india
and
among
the
gipsies
of
europe
men
in
remote
times
may
have
had
more
highlydeveloped
instincts
which
enabled
them
to
avoid
or
use
poisons
but
the
late
archbishop
whately
has
proved
that
wholly
untaught
savages
never
could
invent
anything
or
even
subsist
at
all
abundant
corroboration
of
his
arguments
is
met
with
in
this
country
where
the
natives
require
but
little
in
the
way
of
clothing
and
have
remarkably
hardy
stomachs
although
possessing
a
knowledge
of
all
the
edible
roots
and
fruits
in
the
country
having
hoes
to
dig
with
and
spears
bows
and
arrows
to
kill
the
gamewe
have
seen
that
notwithstanding
all
these
appliances
and
means
to
boot
they
have
perished
of
absolute
starvation
the
art
of
making
fire
is
the
same
in
india
as
in
africa
the
smelting
furnaces
for
reducing
iron
and
copper
from
the
ores
are
also
similar
yellow
haematite
which
bears
not
the
smallest
resemblance
either
in

employed
near
kolobeng
for
the
production
of
iron
malachite
the
precious
green
stone
used
in
civilized
life
for
vases
would
never
be
suspected
by
the
uninstructed
to
be
a
rich
ore
of
copper
and
yet
it
is
extensively
smelted
for
rings
and
other
ornaments
in
the
heart
of
africa
a
copper
bar
of
native
manufacture
four
feet
long
was
offered
to
us
for
sale
at
chinsambas
these
arts
are
monuments
attesting
the
fact
that
some
instruction
from
above
must
at
some
time
or
other
have
been
supplied
to
mankind
and
as
archbishop
whately
says
the
most
probable
conclusion
is
that
man
when
first
created
or
very
shortly
afterwards
was
advanced
by
the
creator
himself
to
a
state
above
that
of
a
mere
savage
the
argument
for
an
original
revelation
to
man
though
quite
independent
of
the
bible
history
tends
to
confirm
that
history
it
is
of
the
same
nature
with
this
that
man
could
not
have
made
himself
and
therefore
must
have
had
a
divine
creator
mankind
could
not
in
the
first
instance
have
civilized
themselves
and
therefore
must
have
had
a
superhuman
instructor
in
connection
with
this
subject
it
is
remarkable
that
throughout
successive
generations
no
change
has
taken
place
in
the
form
of
the
various
inventions
hammers
tongs
hoes
axes
adzes
handles
to
them
needles
bows
and
arrows
with
the
mode
of
feathering
the
latter
spears
for
killing
game
with
spearheads
having
what
is
termed
dish
on
both
sides
to
give
them
when
thrown
the
rotatory
motion
of
rifleballs
the
arts
of
spinning
and
weaving
with
that
of
pounding
and
steeping
the
inner
bark
of
a
tree
till
it
serves
as
clothing
millstones
for
grinding
corn
into
meal
the
manufacture
of
the
same
kind
of
pots
or
chatties
as
in
india
the
art
of
cooking
of
brewing
beer
and
straining
it
as
was
done
in
ancient
egypt
fishhooks
fishing
and
hunting
nets
fishbaskets
and
weirs
the
same
as
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
traps
for
catching
animals
etc
etchave
all
been
so
very
permanent
from
age
to
age
and
some
of
them
of
identical
patterns
are
so
widely
spread
over
the
globe
as
to
render
it
probable
that
they
were
all
at
least
in
some
degree
derived
from
one
source
the
african
traditions
which
seem
possessed
of
the
same
unchangeability
as
the
arts
to
which
they
relate
like
those
of
all
other
nations
refer
their
origin
to
a
superior
being
and
it
is
much
more
reasonable
to
receive
the
hints
given
in
genesis
concerning
direct
instruction
from
god
to
our
first
parents
or
their
children
in
religious
or
moral
duty
and
probably
in
the
knowledge
of
the
arts
of
life
than
to
give
credence
to
the
theory
that
untaught
savage
man
subsisted
in
a
state
which
would
prove
fatal
to
all
his
descendants
and
that
in
such
helpless
state
he
made
many
inventions
which
most
of
his
progeny
retained
but
never
improved
upon
during
some
thirty
centuries
we
crossed
in
canoes
the
arm
of
the
lake
which
joins
chia
to
nyassa
and
spent
the
night
on
its
northern
bank
the
whole
country
adjacent
to
the
lake
from
this
point
up
to
kotakota
bay
is
densely
peopled
by
thousands
who
have
fled
from
the
forays
of
the
mazitu
in
hopes
of
protection
from
the
arabs
who
live
there
in
three
running
rivulets
we
saw
the
shuare
palm
and
an
oil
palm
which
is
much
inferior
to
that
on
the
west
coast
though
somewhat
similar
in
appearance
the
fruit
is
not
much
larger
than
hazelnuts
and
the
people
do
not
use
them
on
account
of
the
small
quantity
of
oil
which
they
afford
the
idea
of
using
oil
for
light
never
seems
to
have
entered
the
african
mind
here
a
bundle
of
split
and
dried
bamboo
tied
together
with
creeping
plants
as
thick
as
a
mans
body
and
about
twenty
feet
in
length
is
employed
in
the
canoes
as
a
torch
to
attract
the
fish
at
night
it
would
be
considered
a
piece
of
the
most
wasteful
extravagance
to
burn
the
oil
they
obtain
from
the
castoroil
bean
and
other
seeds
and
also
from
certain
fish
or
in
fact
to
do
anything
with
it
but
anoint
their
heads
and
bodies
we
arrived
at
kotakota
bay
in
the
afternoon
of
the
th
september
and
sat
down
under
a
magnificent
wild
figtree
with
leaves
ten
inches
long
by
five
broad
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
village
of
juma
ben
saidi
and
yakobe
ben
arame
whom
we
had
met
on
the
river
kaombe
a
little
north
of
this
in
our
first
exploration
of
the
lake
we
had
rested
but
a
short
time
when
juma
who
is
evidently
the
chief
person
here
followed
by
about
fifty
people
came
to
salute
us
and
to
invite
us
to
take
up
our
quarters
in
his
village
the
hut
which
by
mistake
was
offered
was
so
small
and
dirty
that
we
preferred
sleeping
in
an
open
space
a
few
hundred
yards
off
juma
afterwards
apologized
for
the
mistake
and
presented
us
with
rice
meal
sugarcane
and
a
piece
of
malachite
we
returned
his
visit
on
the
following
day
and
found
him
engaged
in
building
a
dhow
or
arab
vessel
to
replace
one
which
he
said
had
been
wrecked
this
new
one
was
fifty
feet
long
twelve
feet
broad
and
five
feet
deep
the
planks
were
of
a
wood
like
teak
here
called
timbati
and
the
timbers
of
a
closer
grained
wood
called
msoro
the
sight
of
this
dhow
gave
us
a
hint
which
had
we
previously
received
it
would
have
prevented
our
attempting
to
carry
a
vessel
of
iron
past
the
cataracts
the
trees
around
katosas
village
were
timbati
and
they
would
have
yielded
planks
fifty
feet
long
and
thirty
inches
broad
with
a
few
native
carpenters
a
good
vessel
could
be
built
on
the
lake
nearly
as
quickly
as
one
could
be
carried
past
the
cataracts
and
at
a
vastly
less
cost
juma
said
that
no
money
would
induce
him
to
part
with
this
dhow
he
was
very
busy
in
transporting
slaves
across
the
lake
by
means
of
two
boats
which
we
saw
returning
from
a
trip
in
the
afternoon
as
he
did
not
know
of
our
intention
to
visit
him
we
came
upon
several
gangs
of
stout
young
men
slaves
each
secured
by
the
neck
to
one
common
chain
waiting
for
exportation
and
several
more
in
slavesticks
these
were
all
civilly
removed
before
our
interview
was
over
because
juma
knew
that
we
did
not
relish
the
sight
when
we
met
the
same
arabs
in
they
had
but
few
attendants
according
to
their
own
account
they
had
now
in
the
village
and
adjacent
country
souls
it
is
certain
that
tens
of
thousands
had
flocked
to
them
for
protection
and
all
their
power
and
influence
must
be
attributed
to
the
possession
of
guns
and
gunpowder
this
crowding
of
refugees
to
any
point
where
there
is
a
hope
for
security
for
life
and
property
is
very
common
in
this
region
and
the
knowledge
of
it
made
our
hopes
beat
high
for
the
success
of
a
peaceful
mission
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
the
rate
however
in
which
the
people
here
will
perish
by
the
next
famine
or
be
exported
by
juma
and
others
will
we
fear
depopulate
those
parts
which
we
have
just
described
as
crowded
with
people
hunger
will
ere
long
compel
them
to
sell
each
other
an
intelligent
man
complained
to
us
of
the
arabs
often
seizing
slaves
to
whom
they
took
a
fancy
without
the
formality
of
purchase
but
the
price
is
so
lowfrom
two
to
four
yards
of
calicothat
one
can
scarcely
think
this
seizure
and
exportation
without
payment
worth
their
while
the
boats
were
in
constant
employment
and
curiously
enough
ben
habib
whom
we
met
at
linyanti
in
had
been
taken
across
the
lake
the
day
before
our
arrival
at
this
bay
on
his
way
from
sesheke
to
kilwa
and
we
became
acquainted
with
a
native
servant
of
the
arabs
called
selele
saidallah
who
could
speak
the
makololo
language
pretty
fairly
from
having
once
spent
some
months
in
the
barotse
valley
from
boyhood
upwards
we
have
been
accustomed
from
time
to
time
to
read
in
books
of
travels
about
the
great
advances
annually
made
by
mohammedanism
in
africa
the
rate
at
which
this
religion
spreads
was
said
to
be
so
rapid
that
in
after
days
in
our
own
pretty
extensive
travels
we
have
constantly
been
on
the
look
out
for
the
advancing
wave
from
north
to
south
which
it
was
prophesied
would
soon
reduce
the
entire
continent
to
the
faith
of
the
false
prophet
the
only
foundation
that
we
can
discover
for
the
assertions
referred
to
and
for
others
of
more
recent
date
is
the
fact
that
in
a
remote
corner
of
northwestern
africa
the
fulahs
and
mandingoes
and
some
others
in
northern
africa
as
mentioned
by
dr
barth
have
made
conquests
of
territory
but
even
they
care
so
very
little
for
the
extension
of
their
faith
that
after
the
conquest
no
pains
whatever
are
taken
to
indoctrinate
the
adults
of
the
tribe
this
is
in
exact
accordance
with
the
impression
we
have
received
from
our
intercourse
with
mohammedans
and
christians
the
followers
of
christ
alone
are
anxious
to
propagate
their
faith
a
quasi
philanthropist
would
certainly
never
need
to
recommend
the
followers
of
islam
whom
we
have
met
to
restrain
their
benevolence
by
preaching
that
charity
should
begin
at
home
though
selele
and
his
companions
were
bound
to
their
masters
by
domestic
ties
the
only
new
idea
they
had
imbibed
from
mohammedanism
was
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
eat
meat
killed
by
other
people
they
thought
it
would
be
unlucky
just
as
the
inhabitants
of
kolobeng
before
being
taught
the
requirements
of
christianity
refrained
from
hoeing
their
gardens
on
sundays
lest
they
should
reap
an
unlucky
crop
so
far
as
we
could
learn
no
efforts
had
been
made
to
convert
the
natives
though
these
two
arabs
and
about
a
dozen
halfcastes
had
been
in
the
country
for
many
years
and
judging
from
our
experience
with
a
dozen
mohammedans
in
our
employ
at
high
wages
for
sixteen
months
the
africans
would
be
the
better
men
in
proportion
as
they
retained
their
native
faith
this
may
appear
only
a
harsh
judgment
from
a
mind
imbued
with
christian
prejudices
but
without
any
pretention
to
that
impartiality
which
leaves
it
doubtful
to
which
side
the
affections
lean
the
truth
may
be
fairly
stated
by
one
who
viewed
all
mohammedans
and
africans
with
the
sincerest
good
will
our
twelve
mohammedans
from
johanna
were
the
least
open
of
any
of
our
party
to
impression
from
kindness
a
marked
difference
in
general
conduct
was
apparent
the
makololo
and
other
natives
of
the
country
whom
we
had
with
us
invariably
shared
with
each
other
the
food
they
had
cooked
but
the
johanna
men
partook
of
their
meals
at
a
distance
this
at
first
we
attributed
to
their
moslem
prejudices
but
when
they
saw
the
cooking
process
of
the
others
nearly
complete
they
came
sat
beside
them
and
ate
the
portion
offered
without
ever
remembering
to
return
the
compliment
when
their
own
turn
came
to
be
generous
the
makololo
and
the
others
grumbled
at
their
greediness
yet
always
followed
the
common
custom
of
africans
of
sharing
their
food
with
all
who
sit
around
them
what
vexed
us
most
in
the
johanna
men
was
their
indifference
to
the
welfare
of
each
other
once
when
they
were
all
coming
to
the
ship
after
sleeping
ashore
one
of
them
walked
into
the
water
with
the
intention
of
swimming
off
to
the
boat
and
while
yet
hardly
up
to
his
knees
was
seized
by
a
horrid
crocodile
and
dragged
under
the
poor
fellow
gave
a
shriek
and
held
up
his
hand
for
aid
but
none
of
his
countrymen
stirred
to
his
assistance
and
he
was
never
seen
again
on
asking
his
brotherinlaw
why
he
did
not
help
him
he
replied
well
no
one
told
him
to
go
into
the
water
it
was
his
own
fault
that
he
was
killed
the
makololo
on
the
other
hand
rescued
a
woman
at
senna
by
entering
the
water
and
taking
her
out
of
the
crocodiles
mouth
it
is
not
assumed
that
their
religion
had
much
to
do
in
the
matter
many
mohammedans
might
contrast
favourably
with
indifferent
christians
but
so
far
as
our
experience
in
east
africa
goes
the
moral
tone
of
the
follower
of
mahomed
is
pitched
at
a
lower
key
than
that
of
the
untutored
african
the
ancient
zeal
for
propagating
the
tenets
of
the
koran
has
evaporated
and
been
replaced
by
the
most
intense
selfishness
and
grossest
sensuality
the
only
known
efforts
made
by
mohammedans
namely
those
in
the
northwest
and
north
of
the
continent
are
so
linked
with
the
acquisition
of
power
and
plunder
as
not
to
deserve
the
name
of
religious
propagandism
and
the
only
religion
that
now
makes
proselytes
is
that
of
jesus
christ
to
those
who
are
capable
of
taking
a
comprehensive
view
of
this
subject
nothing
can
be
adduced
of
more
telling
significance
than
the
wellattested
fact
that
while
the
mohammedans
fulahs
and
others
towards
central
africa
make
a
few
proselytes
by
a
process
which
gratifies
their
own
covetousness
three
small
sections
of
the
christian
converts
the
africans
in
the
south
in
the
west
indies
and
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
actually
contribute
for
the
support
and
spread
of
their
religion
upwards
of
pounds
annually
that
religion
which
so
far
overcomes
the
selfishness
of
the
human
heart
must
be
divine
leaving
kotakota
bay
we
turned
away
due
west
on
the
great
slave
route
to
katangas
and
cazembes
country
in
londa
juma
lent
us
his
servant
selele
to
lead
us
the
first
days
march
he
said
that
the
traders
from
kilwa
and
iboe
cross
the
lake
either
at
this
bay
or
at
tsenga
or
at
the
southern
end
of
the
lake
and
that
wherever
they
may
cross
they
all
go
by
this
path
to
the
interior
they
have
slaves
with
them
to
carry
their
goods
and
when
they
reach
a
spot
where
they
can
easily
buy
others
they
settle
down
and
begin
the
traffic
and
at
once
cultivate
grain
so
much
of
the
land
lies
waste
that
no
objection
is
ever
made
to
any
one
taking
possession
of
as
much
as
he
needs
they
can
purchase
a
field
of
cassava
for
their
present
wants
for
very
little
and
they
continue
trading
in
the
country
for
two
or
three
years
and
giving
what
weight
their
muskets
possess
to
the
chief
who
is
most
liberal
to
them
the
first
days
march
led
us
over
a
rich
wellcultivated
plain
this
was
succeeded
by
highlands
undulating
stony
and
covered
with
scraggy
trees
many
banks
of
well
rounded
shingle
appear
the
disintegration
of
the
rocks
now
going
on
does
not
round
off
the
angles
they
are
split
up
by
the
heat
and
cold
into
angular
fragments
on
these
high
downs
we
crossed
the
river
kaombe
beyond
it
we
came
among
the
upland
vegetationrhododendrons
proteas
the
masuko
and
molompi
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
kasukosuko
we
found
the
river
bua
running
north
to
join
the
kaombe
we
had
to
go
a
mile
out
of
our
way
for
a
ford
the
stream
is
deep
enough
in
parts
for
hippopotami
the
various
streams
not
previously
noticed
crossed
in
this
journey
had
before
this
led
us
to
the
conclusion
independently
of
the
testimony
of
the
natives
that
no
large
river
ran
into
the
north
end
of
the
lake
no
such
affluent
was
needed
to
account
for
the
shires
perennial
flow
on
september
th
we
reached
the
top
of
the
ascent
which
from
its
many
ups
and
downs
had
often
made
us
puff
and
blow
as
if
brokenwinded
the
water
of
the
streams
we
crossed
was
deliciously
cold
and
now
that
we
had
gained
the
summit
at
ndonda

the
boilingpoint
of

showed
an
altitude
of
feet
above
the
sea
the
air
was
delightful
looking
back
we
had
a
magnificent
view
of
the
lake
but
the
haze
prevented
our
seeing
beyond
the
sea
horizon
the
scene
was
beautiful
but
it
was
impossible
to
dissociate
the
lovely
landscape
whose
hills
and
dales
had
so
sorely
tried
our
legs
and
lungs
from
the
sad
fact
that
this
was
part
of
the
great
slave
route
now
actually
in
use
by
this
road
many
ten
thousands
have
here
seen
the
sea
the
sea
but
with
sinking
hearts
for
the
universal
idea
among
the
captive
gangs
is
that
they
are
going
to
be
fattened
and
eaten
by
the
whites
they
cannot
of
course
be
so
much
shocked
as
we
should
betheir
sensibilities
are
far
from
fine
their
feelings
are
more
obtuse
than
oursin
fact
the
live
eels
are
used
to
being
skinned
perhaps
they
rather
like
it
we
who
are
not
philosophic
blessed
the
providence
which
at
thermopylae
in
ancient
days
rolled
back
the
tide
of
eastern
conquest
from
the
west
and
so
guided
the
course
of
events
that
light
and
liberty
and
gospel
truth
spread
to
our
distant
isle
and
emancipating
our
race
freed
them
from
the
fear
of
ever
again
having
to
climb
fatiguing
heights
and
descend
wearisome
hollows
in
a
slavegang
as
we
suppose
they
did
when
the
fair
english
youths
were
exposed
for
sale
at
rome
looking
westwards
we
perceived
that
what
from
below
had
the
appearance
of
mountains
was
only
the
edge
of
a
tableland
which
though
at
first
undulating
soon
became
smooth
and
sloped
towards
the
centre
of
the
country
to
the
south
a
prominent
mountain
called
chipata
and
to
the
southwest
another
named
ngalla
by
which
the
bua
is
said
to
rise
gave
character
to
the
landscape
in
the
north
masses
of
hills
prevented
our
seeing
more
than
eight
or
ten
miles
the
air
which
was
so
exhilarating
to
europeans
had
an
opposite
effect
on
five
men
who
had
been
born
and
reared
in
the
malaria
of
the
delta
of
the
zambesi
no
sooner
did
they
reach
the
edge
of
the
plateau
at
ndonda
than
they
lay
down
prostrate
and
complained
of
pains
all
over
them
the
temperature
was
not
much
lower
than
that
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
below
degrees
being
the
mean
temperature
of
the
day
degrees
the
lowest
and
degrees
the
highest
during
the
twentyfour
hours
at
the
lake
it
was
about
l
degrees
higher
of
the
symptoms
they
complained
ofpains
everywherenothing
could
be
made
and
yet
it
was
evident
that
they
had
good
reason
for
saying
that
they
were
ill
they
scarified
almost
every
part
of
their
bodies
as
a
remedial
measure
medicines
administered
on
the
supposition
that
their
malady
was
the
effect
of
a
sudden
chill
had
no
effect
and
in
two
days
one
of
them
actually
died
in
consequence
of
as
far
as
we
could
judge
a
change
from
a
malarious
to
a
purer
and
more
rarefied
atmosphere
as
we
were
on
the
slave
route
we
found
the
people
more
churlish
than
usual
on
being
expostulated
with
about
it
they
replied
we
have
been
made
wary
by
those
who
come
to
buy
slaves
the
calamity
of
death
having
befallen
our
party
seemed
however
to
awaken
their
sympathies
they
pointed
out
their
usual
buryingplace
lent
us
hoes
and
helped
to
make
the
grave
when
we
offered
to
pay
all
expenses
they
showed
that
they
had
not
done
these
friendly
offices
without
fully
appreciating
their
value
for
they
enumerated
the
use
of
the
hut
the
mat
on
which
the
deceased
had
lain
the
hoes
the
labour
and
the
medicine
which
they
had
scattered
over
the
place
to
make
him
rest
in
peace
the
primitive
african
faith
seems
to
be
that
there
is
one
almighty
maker
of
heaven
and
earth
that
he
has
given
the
various
plants
of
earth
to
man
to
be
employed
as
mediators
between
him
and
the
spirit
world
where
all
who
have
ever
been
born
and
died
continue
to
live
that
sin
consists
in
offences
against
their
fellowmen
either
here
or
among
the
departed
and
that
death
is
often
a
punishment
of
guilt
such
as
witchcraft
their
idea
of
moral
evil
differs
in
no
respect
from
ours
but
they
consider
themselves
amenable
only
to
inferior
beings

to

as
theft

or

before
they
knew
aught
of
europeans
or
their
teaching
the
only
new
addition
to
their
moral
code
is
that
it
is
wrong
to
have
more
wives

until
the
arrival
of

never
entered
into
their
minds
even
as
a
doubt
everything
not
to
be
accounted

by
common
causes
whether
of
good
or
evil
is
ascribed
to
the

are

with
the
spirits
of
the
departed
and
when
one
dies
he
is
believed
to
have

the
hosts
of

all
the
africans
we
have
met
with
are
as
firmly
persuaded
of
their
future
existence
as
of
their
present
life
and
we
have
found
none
in
whom
the
belief
in
the
supreme
being
was
not
rooted
he
is
so
invariably
referred
to
as
the
author
of
everything
supernatural
that
unless
one
is
ignorant
of
their
language
he
cannot
fail
to
notice
this
prominent
feature
of
their
faith
when
they
pass
into
the
unseen
world
they
do
not
seem
to
be
possessed
with
the
fear
of
punishment
the
utensils
placed
upon
the
grave
are
all
broken

if
to
indicate
that
they
will
never

in
a
sitting
posture
and
the
hands
are
folded
in
front
in
some
parts
of
the
country
there
are
tales
which
we
could
translate
into
faint
glimmerings
of
a
resurrection
but
whether
these
fables
handed
down
from
age
to
age
convey
that
meaning
to
the
natives
themselves
we
cannot
tell

country
with
a

which
from
the
heavy

appeared
to
be

fertile
many

running

a

found
in

then
still
further
in

some
watercourses
were

to

into

loangwa
which
flows
to

and
enters

and
is
here
called
the

the

were
in

scraggy
and
covered

they

in
the

of
the

with
lichens
resembling
orchilla

the

had
been
planted
on
ridges
to
allow
the
superfluous
moisture
to
run
off
everything
indicated
a
very
humid
climate
and
the
people
warned
us
that
as
the
rains
were
near
we
were
likely
to
be
prevented
from
returning
by
the
country
becoming
flooded
and
impassable
villages
as
usual
encircled
by
euphorbia
hedges
were
numerous
and
a
great
deal
of
grain
had
been
cultivated
around
them
domestic
fowls
in
plenty
and
pigeons
with
dovecots
like
those
in
egypt
were
seen
the
people
call
themselves
matumboka
but
the
only
difference
between
them
and
the
rest
of
the
manganja
is
in
the
mode
of
tattooing
the
face
their
language
is
the
same
their
distinctive
mark
consists
of
four
tattooed
lines
diverging
from
the
point
between
the
eyebrows
which
in
frowning
the
muscles
form
into
a
furrow
the
other
lines
of
tattooing
as
in
all
manganja
run
in
long
seams
which
crossing
each
other
at
certain
angles
form
a
great
number
of
triangular
spaces
on
the
breast
back
arms
and
thighs
the
cuticle
is
divided
by
a
knife
and
the
edges
of
the
incision
are
drawn
apart
till
the
true
skin
appears
by
a
repetition
of
this
process
lines
of
raised
cicatrices
are
formed
which
are
thought
to
give
beauty
no
matter
how
much
pain
the
fashion
gives
it
would
not
be
worth
while
to
advert
for
a
moment
to
the
routine
of
travelling
or
the
little
difficulties
that
beset
every
one
who
attempts
to
penetrate
into
a
new
country
were
it
not
to
show
the
great
source
of
the
power
here
possessed
by
slavetraders
we
needed
help
in
carrying
our
goods
while
our
men
were
ill
though
still
able
to
march
when
we
had
settled
with
others
for
hire
we
were
often
told
that
the
dealers
in
men
had
taken
possession
of
some
and
had
taken
them
away
altogether
other
things
led
us
to
believe
that
the
slavetraders
carry
matters
with
a
high
hand
and
no
wonder
for
the
possession
of
gunpowder
gives
them
almost
absolute
power
the
mode
by
which
tribes
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
carry
on
warfare
or
defend
themselves
is
by
ambuscade
they
never
come
out
in
open
fight
but
wait
for
the
enemy
ensconced
behind
trees
or
in
the
long
grass
of
the
country
and
shoot
at
him
unawares
consequently
if
men
come
against
them
with
firearms
when
as
is
usually
the
case
the
long
grass
is
all
burned
off
the
tribe
attacked
are
as
helpless
as
a
wooden
ship
possessing
only
signal
guns
would
be
before
an
ironclad
steamer
the
time
of
year
selected
for
this
kind
of
warfare
is
nearly
always
that
in
which
the
grass
is
actually
burnt
off
or
is
so
dry
as
readily
to
take
fire
the
dry
grass
in
africa
looks
more
like
ripe
english
wheat
late
in
the
autumn
than
anything
else
we
can
compare
it
to
let
us
imagine
an
english
village
standing
in
a
field
of
this
sort
bounded
only
by
the
horizon
and
enemies
setting
fire
to
a
line
of
a
mile
or
two
by
running
along
with
bunches
of
burning
straw
in
their
hands

and
there

would
not
the
stoutest
english
villager
armed
only
with
the
bow
and
arrow
against
the
enemys
musket
quail
at
the
idea
of
breaking
through
that
wall
of
fire
when
at
a
distance
we
once
saw
a
scene
like
this
and
had
the
charred
grass
literally
as
thick
as
flakes
of
black
snow
falling
around
us
there
was
no
difficulty
in
understanding
the
secret
of
the
slavetraders
power
on
the
st
of
september
we
arrived
at
the
village
of
the
chief
muasi
or
muazi
it
is
surrounded
by
a
stockade
and
embowered
in
very
tall
euphorbiatrees
their
height
thirty
or
forty
feet
shows
that
it
has
been
inhabited
for
at
least
one
generation
a
visitation
of
disease
or
death
causes
the
headmen
to
change
the
site
of
their
villages
and
plant
new
hedges
but
though
muazi
has
suffered
from
the
attacks
of
the
mazitu
he
has
evidently
clung
to
his
birthplace
the
village
is
situated
about
two
miles
southwest
of
a
high
hill
called
kasungu
which
gives
the
name
to
a
district
extending
to
the
loangwa
of
the
maravi
several
other
detached
granite
hills
have
been
shot
up
on
the
plain
and
many
stockaded
villages
all
owing
allegiance
to
muazi
are
scattered
over
it
on
our
arrival
the
chief
was
sitting
in
the
smooth
shady
place
called
boalo
where
all
public
business
is
transacted
with
about
two
hundred
men
and
boys
around
him
we
paid
our
guides
with
due
ostentation
masiko
the
tallest
of
our
party
measured
off
the
fathom
of
cloth
agreed
upon
and
made
it
appear
as
long
as
possible
by
facing
round
to
the
crowd
and
cutting
a
few
inches
beyond
what
his
outstretched
arms
could
reach
to
show
that
there
was
no
deception
this
was
by
way
of
advertisement
the
people
are
mightily
gratified
at
having
a
tall
fellow
to
measure
the
cloth
for
them
it
pleases
them
even
better
than
cutting
it
by
a
tapelinethough
very
few
men
of
six
feet
high
can
measure
off
their
own
length
with
their
outstretched
arms
here
where
arab
traders
have
been
the
cubit
called
mokono
or
elbow
begins
to
take
the
place
of
the
fathom
in
use
further
south
the
measure
is
taken
from
the
point
of
the
bent
elbow
to
the
end
of
the
middle
finger
we
found
on
visiting
muazi
on
the
following
day
that
he
was
as
frank
and
straightforward
as
could
reasonably
be
expected
he
did
not
wish
us
to
go
to
the
nnw
because
he
carries
on
a
considerable
trade
in
ivory
there
we
were
anxious
to
get
off
the
slave
route
to
people
not
visited
before
by
traders
but
muazi
naturally
feared
that
if
we
went
to
what
is
said
to
be
a
wellwatered
country
abounding
in
elephants
we
might
relieve
him
of
the
ivory
which
he
now
obtains
at
a
cheap
rate
and
sells
to
the
slavetraders
as
they
pass
kasungu
to
the
east
but
at
last
he
consented
warning
us
that
great
difficulty
would
be
experienced
in
obtaining
fooda
district
had
been
depopulated
by
slave
warsand
a
night
or
two
must
be
spent
in
it
but
he
would
give
us
good
guides
who
would
go
three
days
with
us
before
turning
and
then
further
progress
must
depend
on
ourselves
some
of
our
men
having
been
ill
ever
since
we
mounted
this
highland
plain
we
remained
two
days
with
muazi
a
herd
of
fine
cattle
showed
that
no
tsetse
existed
in
the
district
they
had
the
indian
hump
and
were
very
fat
and
very
tame
the
boys
rode
on
both
cows
and
bulls
without
fear
and
the
animals
were
so
fat
and
lazy
that
the
old
ones
only
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
kick
their
young
tormentors
muazi
never
milks
the
cows
he
complained
that
but
for
the
mazitu
having
formerly
captured
some
he
should
now
have
had
very
many
they
wander
over
the
country
at
large
and
certainly
thrive
after
leaving
muazis
we
passed
over
a
flat
country
sparsely
covered
with
the
scraggy
upland
trees
but
brightened
with
many
fine
flowers
the
grass
was
short
reaching
no
higher
than
the
knee
and
growing
in
tufts
with
bare
spaces
between
though
the
trees
were
draped
with
many
various
lichens
and
showed
a
moist
climate
a
high
and
very
sharp
wind
blew
over
the
flats
its
piercing
keenness
was
not
caused
by
low
temperature
for
the
thermometer
stood
at
degrees
we
were
now
on
the
sources
of
the
loangwa
of
the
maravi
which
enters
the
zambesi
at
zumbo
and
were
struck
by
the
great
resemblance
which
the
boggy
and
sedgy
streams
here
presented
to
the
sources
of
the
leeba
an
affluent
of
the
zambesi
formerly
observed
in
londa
and
of
the
kasai
which
some
believe
to
be
the
principal
branch
of
the
congo
or
zaire
we
had
taken
pains
to
ascertain
from
the
travelled
babisa
and
arabs
as
much
as
possible
about
the
country
in
front
which
from
the
lessening
time
we
had
at
our
disposal
we
feared
we
could
scarcely
reach
and
had
heard
a
good
deal
of
a
small
lake
called
bemba
as
we
proceeded
west
we
passed
over
the
sources
not
only
of
the
loangwa
but
of
another
stream
called
moitawa
or
moitala
which
was
represented
to
be
the
main
feeder
of
lake
bemba
this
would
be
of
little
importance
but
for
the
fact
that
the
considerable
river
luapula
or
loapula
is
said
to
flow
out
of
bemba
to
the
westward
and
then
to
spread
out
into
another
and
much
larger
lake
named
moero
or
moelo
flowing
still
further
in
the
same
direction
the
loapula
forms
lake
mofue
or
mofu
and
after
this
it
is
said
to
pass
the
town
of
cazembe
bend
to
the
north
and
enter
lake
tanganyika
whither
the
water
went
after
it
entered
the
last
lake
no
one
would
venture
an
assertion
but
that
the
course
indicated
is
the
true
watershed
of
that
part
of
the
country
we
believe
from
the
unvarying
opinion
of
native
travellers
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
our
informants
had
been
in
the
country
beyond
cazembes
for
they
knew
and
described
chiefs
whom
we
afterwards
met
about
thirtyfive
or
forty
miles
west
of
his
town
the
lualaba
is
said
to
flow
into
the
loapulaand
when
for
the
sake
of
testing
the
accuracy
of
the
travelled
it
was
asserted
that
all
the
water
of
the
region
round
the
town
of
cazembe
flowed
into
the
luambadzi
or
luambezi
zambesi
they
remarked
with
a
smile
he
says
that
the
loapula
flows
into
the
zambesidid
you
ever
hear
such
nonsense
or
words
to
that
effect
we
were
forced
to
admit
that
according
to
native
accounts
our
previous
impression
of
the
zambesis
draining
the
country
about
cazembes
had
been
a
mistake
their
geographical
opinions
are
now
only
stated
without
any
further
comment
than
that
the
itinerary
given
by
the
arabs
and
others
shows
that
the
loapula
is
twice
crossed
on
the
way
to
cazembes
and
we
may
add
that
we
have
never
found
any
difficulty
from
the
alleged
incapacity
of
the
negro
to
tell
which
way
a
river
flows
the
boilingpoint
of
water
showed
a
descent
from
the
edge
of
the
plateau
to
our
furthest
point
west
of
feet
but
this
can
only
be
considered
as
an
approximation
and
no
dependence
could
have
been
placed
on
it
had
we
not
had
the
courses
of
the
streams
to
confirm
this
rather
rough
mode
of
ascertaining
altitudes
the
slope
as
shown
by
the
watershed
was
to
the
loangwa
of
the
maravi
and
towards
the
moitala
or
southwest
west
and
northwest
after
we
leave
the
feeders
of
lake
nyassa
the
water
drains
towards
the
centre
of
the
continent
the
course
of
the
kasai
a
river
seen
during
dr
livingstones
journey
to
the
west
coast
and
its
feeders
was
to
the
northeast
or
somewhat
in
the
same
direction
whether
the
water
thus
drained
off
finds
its
way
out
by
the
congo
or
by
the
nile
has
not
yet
been
ascertained
some
parts
of
the
continent
have
been
said
to
resemble
an
inverted
dinnerplate
this
portion
seems
more
of
the
shape
if
shape
it
has
of
a
wideawake
hat
with
the
crown
a
little
depressed
the
altitude
of
the
brim
in
some
parts
is
considerable
in
others
as
at
tette
and
the
bottom
of
murchisons
cataracts
it
is
so
small
that
it
could
be
ascertained
only
by
eliminating
the
daily
variations
of
the
barometer
by
simultaneous
observations
on
the
coast
and
at
points
some
two
or
three
hundred
miles
inland
so
long
as
african
rivers
remain
in
what
we
may
call
the
brim
they
present
no
obstructions
but
no
sooner
do
they
emerge
from
the
higher
lands
than
their
utility
is
impaired
by
cataracts
the
low
lying
belt
is
very
irregular
at
times
sloping
up
in
the
manner
of
the
rim
of
an
inverted
dinnerplatewhile
in
other
cases
a
high
ridge
rises
near
the
sea
to
be
succeeded
by
a
lower
district
inland
before
we
reach
the
central
plateau
the
breadth
of
the
low
lands
is
sometimes
as
much
as
three
hundred
miles
and
that
breadth
determines
the
limits
of
navigation
from
the
seaward
we
made
three
long
marches
beyond
muazis
in
a
northwesterly
direction
the
people
were
civil
enough
but
refused
to
sell
us
any
food
we
were
travelling
too
fast
they
said
in
fact
they
were
startled
and
before
they
recovered
their
surprise
we
were
obliged
to
depart
we
suspected
that
muazi
had
sent
them
orders
to
refuse
us
food
that
we
might
thus
be
prevented
from
going
into
the
depopulated
district
but
this
may
have
been
mere
suspicion
the
result
of
our
own
uncharitable
feelings
we
spent
one
night
at
machambwes
village
and
another
at
chimbuzis
it
is
seldom
that
we
can
find
the
headman
on
first
entering
a
village
he
gets
out
of
the
way
till
he
has
heard
all
about
the
strangers
or
he
is
actually
out
in
the
fields
looking
after
his
farms
we
once
thought
that
when
the
headman
came
in
from
a
visit
of
inspection
with
his
spear
bow
and
arrows
they
had
been
all
taken
up
for
the
occasion
and
that
he
had
all
the
while
been
hidden
in
some
hut
slily
watching
till
he
heard
that
the
strangers
might
be
trusted
but
on
listening
to
the
details
given
by
these
men
of
the
appearances
of
the
crops
at
different
parts
and
the
astonishing
minuteness
of
the
speakers
topography
we
were
persuaded
that
in
some
cases
we
were
wrong
and
felt
rather
humiliated
every
knoll
hill
mountain
and
every
peak
on
a
range
has
a
name
and
so
has
every
watercourse
dell
and
plain
in
fact
every
feature
and
portion
of
the
country
is
so
minutely
distinguished
by
appropriate
names
that
it
would
take
a
lifetime
to
decipher
their
meaning
it
is
not
the
want
but
the
superabundance
of
names
that
misleads
travellers
and
the
terms
used
are
so
multifarious
that
good
scholars
will
at
times
scarcely
know
more
than
the
subject
of
conversation
though
it
is
a
little
apart
from
the
topic
of
the
attention
which
the
headmen
pay
to
agriculture
yet
it
may
be
here
mentioned
while
speaking
of
the
fulness
of
the
language
that
we
have
heard
about
a
score
of
words
to
indicate
different
varieties
of
gaitone
walks
leaning
forward
or
backward
swaying
from
side
to
side
loungingly
or
smartly
swaggeringly
swinging
the
arms
or
only
one
arm
head
down
or
up
or
otherwise
each
of
these
modes
of
walking
was
expressed
by
a
particular
verb
and
more
words
were
used
to
designate
the
different
varieties
of
fools
than
we
ever
tried
to
count
mr
moffat
has
translated
the
whole
bible
into
the
language
of
the
bechuana
and
has
diligently
studied
this
tongue
for
the
last
fortyfour
years
and
though
knowing
far
more
of
the
language
than
any
of
the
natives
who
have
been
reared
on
the
missionstation
of
kuruman
he
does
not
pretend
to
have
mastered
it
fully
even
yet
however
copious
it
may
be
in
terms
of
which
we
do
not
feel
the
necessity
it
is
poor
in
others
as
in
abstract
terms
and
words
used
to
describe
mental
operations
our
third
days
march
ended
in
the
afternoon
of
the
th
september
at
the
village
of
chinanga
on
the
banks
of
a
branch
of
the
loangwa
a
large
rounded
mass
of
granite
a
thousand
feet
high
called
nombe
rume
stand
on
the
plain
a
few
miles
off
it
is
quite
remarkable
because
it
has
so
little
vegetation
on
it
several
other
granitic
hills
stand
near
it
ornamented
with
trees
like
most
heights
of
this
country
and
a
heap
of
blue
mountains
appears
away
in
the
north
the
effect
of
the
piercing
winds
upon
the
men
had
never
been
got
rid
of
several
had
been
unable
to
carry
a
load
ever
since
we
ascended
to
the
highlands
we
had
lost
one
and
another
poor
lad
was
so
ill
as
to
cause
us
great
anxiety
by
waiting
in
this
village
which
was
so
old
that
it
was
full
of
vermin
all
became
worse
our
european
food
was
entirely
expended
and
native
meal
though
finely
ground
has
so
many
sharp
angular
particles
in
it
that
it
brought
back
dysentery
from
which
we
had
suffered
so
much
in
may
we
could
scarcely
obtain
food
for
the
men
the
headman
of
this
village
of
chinanga
was
off
in
a
foray
against
some
people
further
north
to
supply
slaves
to
the
traders
expected
along
the
slave
route
we
had
just
left
and
was
said
after
having
expelled
the
inhabitants
to
be
living
in
their
stockade
and
devouring
their
corn
the
conquered
tribe
had
purchased
what
was
called
a
peace
by
presenting
the
conqueror
with
three
women
this
state
of
matters
afforded
us
but
a
poor
prospect
of
finding
more
provisions
in
that
direction
than
we
could
with
great
difficulty
and
at
enormous
prices
obtain
here
but
neither
want
of
food
dysentery
nor
slave
wars
would
have
prevented
our
working
our
way
round
the
lake
in
some
other
direction
had
we
had
time
but
we
had
received
orders
from
the
foreign
office
to
take
the
pioneer
down
to
the
sea
in
the
previous
april
the
salaries
of
all
the
men
in
her
were
positively
in
any
case
to
cease
by
the
st
of
december
we
were
said
to
be
only
ten
days
distant
from
lake
bemba
we
might
speculate
on
a
late
rise
of
the
river
a
month
or
six
weeks
would
secure
a
geographical
feat
but
the
rains
were
near
we
had
been
warned
by
different
people
that
the
rains
were
close
at
hand
and
that
we
should
then
be
bogged
and
unable
to
travel
the
flood
in
the
river
might
be
an
early
one
or
so
small
in
volume
as
to
give
but
one
chance
of
the
pioneer
descending
to
the
ocean
the
makololo
too
were
becoming
dispirited
by
sickness
and
want
of
food
and
were
naturally
anxious
to
be
back
to
their
fields
in
time
for
sowing
but
in
addition
to
all
this
and
more
it
was
felt
that
it
would
not
be
dealing
honestly
with
the
government
were
we
for
the
sake
of
a
little
eclat
to
risk
the
detention
of
the
pioneer
up
the
river
during
another
year
so
we
decided
to
return
and
though
we
had
afterwards
the
mortification
to
find
that
we
were
detained
two
full
months
at
the
ship
waiting
for
the
flood
which
we
expected
immediately
after
our
arrival
there
the
chagrin
was
lessened
by
a
consciousness
of
having
acted
in
a
fair
honest
aboveboard
manner
throughout
on
the
night
of
the
th
of
september
a
thief
came
to
the
sleepingplace
of
our
men
and
stole
a
leg
of
a
goat
on
complaining
to
the
deputy
headman
he
said
that
the
thief
had
fled
but
would
be
caught
he
suggested
a
fine
and
offered
a
fowl
and
her
eggs
but
wishing
that
the
thief
alone
should
be
punished
it
was
advised
that
he
should
be
found
and
fined
the
makololo
thought
it
best
to
take
the
fowl
as
a
means
of
making
the
punishment
certain
after
settling
this
matter
on
the
last
day
of
september
we
commenced
our
return
journey
we
had
just
the
same
time
to
go
back
to
the
ship
that
we
had
spent
in
coming
to
this
point
and
there
is
not
much
to
interest
one
in
marching
over
the
same
ground
a
second
time
while
on
our
journey
northwest
a
cheery
old
woman
who
had
once
been
beautiful
but
whose
white
hair
now
contrasted
strongly
with
her
dark
complexion
was
working
briskly
in
her
garden
as
we
passed
she
seemed
to
enjoy
a
hale
hearty
old
age
she
saluted
us
with
what
elsewhere
would
be
called
a
good
address
and
evidently
conscious
that
she
deserved
the
epithet
dark
but
comely
answered
each
of
us
with
a
frank
yes
my
child
another
motherlylooking
woman
sitting
by
a
well
began
the
conversation
by
you
are
going
to
visit
muazi
and
you
have
come
from
afar
have
you
not
but
in
general
women
never
speak
to
strangers
unless
spoken
to
so
anything
said
by
them
attracts
attention
muazi
once
presented
us
with
a
basket
of
corn
on
hinting
that
we
had
no
wife
to
grind
our
corn
his
buxom
spouse
struck
in
with
roguish
glee
and
said
i
will
grind
it
for
you
and
leave
muazi
to
accompany
and
cook
for
you
in
the
land
of
the
setting
sun
as
a
rule
the
women
are
modest
and
retiring
in
their
demeanour
and
without
being
oppressed
with
toil
show
a
great
deal
of
industry
the
crops
need
about
eight
months
attention
then
when
the
harvest
is
home
much
labour
is
required
to
convert
it
into
food
as
porridge
or
beer
the
corn
is
pounded
in
a
large
wooden
mortar
like
the
ancient
egyptian
one
with
a
pestle
six
feet
long
and
about
four
inches
thick
the
pounding
is
performed
by
two
or
even
three
women
at
one
mortar
each
before
delivering
a
blow
with
her
pestle
gives
an
upward
jerk
of
the
body
so
as
to
put
strength
into
the
stroke
and
they
keep
exact
time
so
that
two
pestles
are
never
in
the
mortar
at
the
same
moment
the
measured
thud
thud
thud
and
the
women
standing
at
their
vigorous
work
are
associations
inseparable
from
a
prosperous
african
village
by
the
operation
of
pounding
with
the
aid
of
a
little
water
the
hard
outside
scale
or
husk
of
the
grain
is
removed
and
the
corn
is
made
fit
for
the
millstone
the
meal
irritates
the
stomach
unless
cleared
from
the
husk
without
considerable
energy
in
the
operator
the
husk
sticks
fast
to
the
corn
solomon
thought
that
still
more
vigour
than
is
required
to
separate
the
hard
husk
or
bran
from
wheat
would
fail
to
separate
a
fool
from
his
folly
though
thou
shouldst
bray
a
fool
in
a
mortar
among
wheat
with
a
pestle
yet
will
not
his
foolishness
depart
from
him
the
rainbow
in
some
parts
is
called
the
pestle
of
the
barimo
or
gods
boys
and
girls
by
constant
practice
with
the
pestle
are
able
to
plant
stakes
in
the
ground
by
a
somewhat
similar
action
in
erecting
a
hut
so
deftly
that
they
never
miss
the
first
hole
made
let
any
one
try
by
repeatedly
jobbing
a
pole
with
all
his
force
to
make
a
deep
hole
in
the
ground
and
he
will
understand
how
difficult
it
is
always
to
strike
it
into
the
same
spot
as
we
were
sleeping
one
night
outside
a
hut
but
near
enough
to
hear
what
was
going
on
within
an
anxious
mother
began
to
grind
her
corn
about
two
oclock
in
the
morning
ma
inquired
a
little
girl
why
grind
in
the
dark
mamma
advised
sleep
and
administered
material
for
a
sweet
dream
to
her
darling
by
saying
i
grind
meal
to
buy
a
cloth
from
the
strangers
which
will
make
you
look
a
little
lady
an
observer
of
these
primitive
races
is
struck
continually
with
such
little
trivial
touches
of
genuine
human
nature
the
mill
consists
of
a
block
of
granite
syenite
or
even
mica
schist
fifteen
or
eighteen
inches
square
and
five
or
six
thick
with
a
piece
of
quartz
or
other
hard
rock
about
the
size
of
a
half
brick
one
side
of
which
has
a
convex
surface
and
fits
into
a
concave
hollow
in
the
larger
and
stationary
stone
the
workwoman
kneeling
grasps
this
upper
millstone
with
both
hands
and
works
it
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
hollow
of
the
lower
millstone
in
the
same
way
that
a
baker
works
his
dough
when
pressing
it
and
pushing
from
him
the
weight
of
the
person
is
brought
to
bear
on
the
movable
stone
and
while
it
is
pressed
and
pushed
forwards
and
backwards
one
hand
supplies
every
now
and
then
a
little
grain
to
be
thus
at
first
bruised
and
then
ground
on
the
lower
stone
which
is
placed
on
the
slope
so
that
the
meal
when
ground
falls
on
to
a
skin
or
mat
spread
for
the
purpose
this
is
perhaps
the
most
primitive
form
of
mill
and
anterior
to
that
in
oriental
countries
where
two
women
grind
at
one
mill
and
may
have
been
that
used
by
sarah
of
old
when
she
entertained
the
angels
on
nd
october
we
applied
to
muazi
for
guides
to
take
us
straight
down
to
chinsambas
at
mosapo
and
thus
cut
off
an
angle
which
we
should
otherwise
make
by
going
back
to
kotakota
bay
he
replied
that
his
people
knew
the
short
way
to
chinsambas
that
we
desired
to
go
but
that
they
all
were
afraid
to
venture
there
on
account
of
the
zulus
or
mazitu
we
therefore
started
back
on
our
old
route
and
after
three
hours
march
found
some
babisa
in
a
village
who
promised
to
lead
us
to
chinsamba
we
meet
with
these
keen
traders
everywhere
they
are
easily
known
by
a
line
of
horizontal
cicatrices
each
half
an
inch
long
down
the
middle
of
the
forehead
and
chin
they
often
wear
the
hair
collected
in
a
mass
on
the
upper
and
back
part
of
the
head
while
it
is
all
shaven
off
the
forehead
and
temples
the
babisa
and
waiau
or
ajawa
heads
have
more
of
the
round
bulletshape
than
those
of
the
manganja
indicating
a
marked
difference
in
character
the
former
people
being
great
traders
and
travellers
the
latter
being
attached
to
home
and
agriculture
the
manganja
usually
intrust
their
ivory
to
the
babisa
to
be
sold
at
the
coast
and
complain
that
the
returns
made
never
come
up
to
the
high
prices
which
they
hear
so
much
about
before
it
is
sent
in
fact
by
the
time
the
babisa
return
the
expenses
of
the
journey
in
which
they
often
spend
a
month
or
two
at
a
place
where
food
abounds
usually
eat
up
all
the
profits
our
new
companions
were
trading
in
tobacco
and
had
collected
quantities
of
the
round
balls
about
the
size
of
nine
pounder
shot
into
which
it
is
formed
one
of
them
owned
a
woman
whose
child
had
been
sold
that
morning
for
tobacco
the
mother
followed
him
weeping
silently
for
hours
along
the
way
we
went
she
seemed
to
be
well
known
for
at
several
hamlets
the
women
spoke
to
her
with
evident
sympathy
we
could
do
nothing
to
alleviate
her
sorrowthe
child
would
be
kept
until
some
slave
trader
passed
and
then
sold
for
calico
the
different
cases
of
slave
trading
observed
by
us
are
mentioned
in
order
to
give
a
fair
idea
of
its
details
we
spent
the
first
night
after
leaving
the
slave
route
at
the
village
of
nkoma
among
a
section
of
manganja
called
machewa
or
macheba
whose
district
extends
to
the
bua
the
next
village
at
which
we
slept
was
also
that
of
a
manganja
smith
it
was
a
beautiful
spot
shaded
with
tall
euphorbiatrees
the
people
at
first
fled
but
after
a
short
time
returned
and
ordered
us
off
to
a
stockade
of
babisa
about
a
mile
distant
we
preferred
to
remain
in
the
smooth
shady
spot
outside
the
hamlet
to
being
pent
up
in
a
treeless
stockade
twenty
or
thirty
men
came
dropping
in
all
fully
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
some
of
them
were
at
least
six
feet
four
in
height
yet
these
giants
were
not
ashamed
to
say
we
thought
that
you
were
mazitu
and
being
afraid
ran
away
their
orders
to
us
were
evidently
inspired
by
terror
and
so
must
the
refusal
of
the
headman
to
receive
a
cloth
or
lend
us
a
hut
have
been
but
as
we
never
had
the
opportunity
of
realizing
what
feelings
a
successful
invasion
would
produce
we
did
not
know
whether
to
blame
them
or
not
the
headman
a
tall
old
smith
with
an
enormous
wellmade
knife
of
his
own
workmanship
came
quietly
round
and
inspecting
the
shelter
which
from
there
being
abundance
of
long
grass
and
bushes
near
our
men
put
up
for
us
in
half
an
hour
gradually
changed
his
tactics
and
in
the
evening
presented
us
with
a
huge
pot
of
porridge
and
a
deliciously
wellcooked
fowl
and
made
an
apology
for
having
been
so
rude
to
strangers
and
a
lamentation
that
he
had
been
so
foolish
as
to
refuse
the
fine
cloth
we
had
offered
another
cloth
was
of
course
presented
and
we
had
the
pleasure
of
parting
good
friends
next
day
our
guide
who
belonged
to
the
stockade
near
to
which
we
had
slept
declined
to
risk
himself
further
than
his
home
while
waiting
to
hire
another
masiko
attempted
to
purchase
a
goat
and
had
nearly
concluded
the
bargain
when
the
wife
of
the
wouldbe
seller
came
forward
and
said
to
her
husband
you
appear
as
if
you
were
unmarried
selling
a
goat
without
consulting
your
wife
what
an
insult
to
a
woman
what
sort
of
man
are
you
masiko
urged
the
man
saying
let
us
conclude
the
bargain
and
never
mind
her
but
he
being
better
instructed
replied
no
i
have
raised
a
host
against
myself
already
and
refused
we
now
pushed
on
to
the
east
so
as
to
get
down
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
into
the
parts
where
we
were
known
the
country
was
beautiful
well
wooded
and
undulating
but
the
villages
were
all
deserted
and
the
flight
of
the
people
seemed
to
have
been
quite
recent
for
the
grain
was
standing
in
the
cornsafes
untouched
the
tobacco
though
ripe
remained
uncut
in
the
gardens
and
the
whole
country
was
painfully
quiet
the
oppressive
stillness
quite
unbroken
by
the
singing
of
birds
or
the
shrill
calls
of
women
watching
their
corn
on
passing
a
beautiful
village
called
bangwe
surrounded
by
shady
trees
and
placed
in
a
valley
among
mountains
we
were
admiring
the
beauty
of
the
situation
when
some
of
the
much
dreaded
mazitu
with
their
shields
ran
out
of
the
hamlet
from
which
we
were
a
mile
distant
they
began
to
scream
to
their
companions
to
give
us
chase
without
quickening
our
pace
we
walked
on
and
soon
were
in
a
wood
through
which
the
footpath
we
were
following
led
the
first
intimation
we
had
of
the
approaching
mazitu
was
given
by
the
johanna
man
zachariah
who
always
lagged
behind
running
up
screaming
as
if
for
his
life
the
bundles
were
all
put
in
one
place
to
be
defended
and
masiko
and
dr
livingstone
walked
a
few
paces
back
to
meet
the
coming
foe
masiko
knelt
down
anxious
to
fire
but
was
ordered
not
to
do
so
for
a
second
or
two
dusky
forms
appeared
among
the
trees
and
the
mazitu
were
asked
in
their
own
tongue
what
do
you
want
masiko
adding
what
do
you
say
no
answer
was
given
but
the
dark
shade
in
the
forest
vanished
they
had
evidently
taken
us
for
natives
and
the
sight
of
a
white
man
was
sufficient
to
put
them
to
flight
had
we
been
nearer
the
coast
where
the
people
are
accustomed
to
the
slave
trade
we
should
have
found
this
affair
a
more
difficult
one
to
deal
with
but
as
a
rule
the
people
of
the
interior
are
much
more
mild
in
character
than
those
on
the
confines
of
civilization
the
above
very
small
adventure
was
all
the
danger
we
were
aware
of
in
this
journey
but
a
report
was
spread
from
the
portuguese
villages
on
the
zambesi
similar
to
several
rumours
that
had
been
raised
before
that
dr
livingstone
had
been
murdered
by
the
makololo
and
very
unfortunately
the
report
reached
england
before
it
could
be
contradicted
one
benefit
arose
from
the
mazitu
adventure
zachariah
and
others
who
had
too
often
to
be
reproved
for
lagging
behind
now
took
their
places
in
the
front
rank
and
we
had
no
difficulty
in
making
very
long
marches
for
several
days
for
all
believed
that
the
mazitu
would
follow
our
footsteps
and
attack
us
while
we
slept
a
party
of
babisa
tobaccotraders
came
from
the
nw
to
molamba
while
we
were
there
and
one
of
them
asserted
several
times
that
the
loapula
after
emerging
from
moelo
received
the
lulua
and
then
flowed
into
lake
mofu
and
thence
into
tanganyika
and
from
the
lastnamed
lake
into
the
sea
this
is
the
native
idea
of
the
geography
of
the
interior
and
to
test
the
general
knowledge
of
our
informant
we
asked
him
about
our
acquaintances
in
londa
as
moene
katema
shinde
or
shinte
who
live
southwest
of
the
rivers
mentioned
and
found
that
our
friends
there
were
perfectly
wellknown
to
him
and
to
others
of
these
travelled
natives
in
the
evening
two
of
the
babisa
came
in
and
reported
that
the
mazitu
had
followed
us
to
the
village
called
chigaragara
at
which
we
slept
at
the
bottom
of
the
descent
the
whole
party
of
traders
set
off
at
once
though
the
sun
had
set
we
ourselves
had
given
rise
to
the
report
for
the
women
of
chigaragara
supposing
us
in
the
distance
to
be
mazitu
fled
with
all
their
household
utensils
on
their
heads
and
had
no
opportunity
afterwards
of
finding
out
their
mistake
we
spent
the
night
where
we
were
and
next
morning
declining
nkomos
entreaty
to
go
and
kill
elephants
took
our
course
along
the
shores
of
the
lake
southwards
we
have
only
been
at
the
lake
at
one
season
of
the
year
then
the
wind
blows
strongly
from
the
east
and
indeed
this
is
its
prevailing
direction
hence
to
the
orange
river
a
north
or
a
south
wind
is
rare
and
seldom
lasts
more
than
three
days
as
the
breeze
now
blew
over
a
large
body
of
water
towards
us
it
was
delightful
but
when
facing
it
on
the
table
land
it
was
so
strong
as
materially
to
impede
our
progress
and
added
considerably
to
the
labour
of
travelling
here
it
brought
large
quantities
of
the
plant
vallisneriae
from
which
the
natives
extract
salt
by
burning
and
which
if
chewed
at
once
shows
its
saline
properties
by
the
taste
clouds
of
the
kungo
or
edible
midges
floated
on
the
lake
and
many
rested
on
the
bushes
on
land
the
reeds
along
the
shores
of
the
lake
were
still
crowded
with
fugitives
and
a
great
loss
of
life
must
since
have
taken
place
for
after
the
corn
they
had
brought
with
them
was
expended
famine
would
ensue
even
now
we
passed
many
women
and
children
digging
up
the
roots
about
the
size
of
peas
of
an
aromatic
grass
and
their
wasted
forms
showed
that
this
poor
hard
fare
was
to
allay
if
possible
the
pangs
of
hunger
the
babies
at
the
breast
crowed
to
us
as
we
passed
their
mothers
kneeling
and
grubbing
for
the
roots
the
poor
little
things
still
drawing
nourishment
from
the
natural
fountain
were
unconscious
of
that
sinking
of
heart
which
their
parents
must
have
felt
in
knowing
that
the
supply
for
the
little
ones
must
soon
fail
no
one
would
sell
a
bit
of
food
to
us
fishermen
even
would
not
part
with
the
produce
of
their
nets
except
in
exchange
for
some
other
kind
of
food
numbers
of
newlymade
graves
showed
that
many
had
already
perished
and
hundreds
were
so
emaciated
that
they
had
the
appearance
of
human
skeletons
swathed
in
brown
and
wrinkled
leather
in
passing
mile
after
mile
marked
with
these
sad
proofs
that
mans
inhumanity
to
man
makes
countless
thousands
mourn
one
experiences
an
overpowering
sense
of
helplessness
to
alleviate
human
woe
and
breathes
a
silent
prayer
to
the
almighty
to
hasten
the
good
time
coming
when
man
and
man
the
world
oer
shall
brothers
be
for
all
that
one
small
redeeming
consideration
in
all
this
misery
could
not
but
be
felt
these
ills
were
inflicted
by
heathen
mazitu
and
not
by
or
for
those
who
say
to
him
who
is
higher
than
the
highest
we
believe
that
thou
shalt
come
to
be
our
judge
we
crossed
the
mokole
rested
at
chitanda
and
then
left
the
lake
and
struck
away
nw
to
chinsambas
our
companions
who
were
so
much
oppressed
by
the
rarefied
air
of
the
plateau
still
showed
signs
of
exhaustion
though
now
only
feet
above
the
sea
and
did
not
recover
flesh
and
spirits
till
we
again
entered
the
lower
shire
valley
which
is
of
so
small
an
altitude
that
without
simultaneous
observations
with
the
barometer
there
and
on
the
seacoast
the
difference
would
not
be
appreciable
on
a
large
plain
on
which
we
spent
one
night
we
had
the
company
of
eighty
tobacco
traders
on
their
way
from
kasungu
to
chinsambas
the
mazitu
had
attacked
and
killed
two
of
them
near
the
spot
where
the
zulus
fled
from
us
without
answering
our
questions
the
traders
were
now
so
frightened
that
instead
of
making
a
straight
course
with
us
they
set
off
by
night
to
follow
the
shores
of
the
lake
to
tsenga
and
then
turn
west
it
is
the
sight
of
shields
or
guns
that
inspires
terror
the
bowmen
feel
perfectly
helpless
when
the
enemy
comes
with
even
the
small
protection
the
skin
shield
affords
or
attacks
them
in
the
open
field
with
guns
they
may
shoot
a
few
arrows
but
they
are
such
poor
shots
that
ten
to
one
if
they
hit
the
only
thing
that
makes
the
arrow
formidable
is
the
poison
for
if
the
poisoned
barb
goes
in
nothing
can
save
the
wounded
a
bow
is
in
use
in
the
lower
end
of
lake
nyassa
but
is
more
common
in
the
maravi
country
from
six
to
eight
inches
broad
which
is
intended
to
be
used
as
a
shield
as
well
as
a
bow
but
we
never
saw
one
with
the
mark
on
it
of
an
enemys
arrow
it
certainly
is
no
match
for
the
zulu
shield
which
is
between
four
and
five
feet
long
of
an
oval
shape
and
about
two
feet
broad
so
great
is
the
terror
this
shield
inspires
that
we
sometimes
doubted
whether
the
mazitu
here
were
zulus
at
all
and
suspected
that
the
people
of
the
country
took
advantage
of
that
fear
and
assuming
shields
pretended
to
belong
to
that
nation
on
the
th
october
we
arrived
at
the
stockade
of
chinsamba
in
mosapo
and
had
reason
to
be
very
well
satisfied
with
his
kindness
a
paraffin
candle
was
in
his
eyes
the
height
of
luxury
and
the
ability
to
make
a
light
instantaneously
by
a
lucifer
match
a
marvel
that
struck
him
with
wonder
he
brought
all
his
relatives
in
different
groups
to
see
the
strange
sightsinstantaneous
firemaking
and
a
light
without
the
annoyance
of
having
fire
and
smoke
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
when
they
wish
to
look
for
anything
in
the
dark
a
wisp
of
dried
grass
is
lighted
chinsamba
gave
us
a
great
deal
of
his
company
during
our
visits
as
we
have
often
remarked
in
other
cases
a
chief
has
a
great
deal
to
attend
to
in
guiding
the
affairs
of
his
people
he
is
consulted
on
all
occasions
and
gives
his
advice
in
a
stream
of
words
which
show
a
very
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
topography
of
his
district
he
knows
every
rood
cultivated
every
weir
put
in
the
river
every
huntingnet
loom
gorge
and
every
child
of
his
tribe
any
addition
made
to
the
number
of
these
latter
is
notified
to
him
and
he
sends
thanks
and
compliments
to
the
parents
the
presents
which
following
the
custom
of
the
country
we
gave
to
every
headman
where
we
either
spent
a
night
or
a
longer
period
varied
from
four
to
eight
yards
of
calico
we
had
some
manchester
cloths
made
in
imitation
of
the
native
manufactured
robes
of
the
west
coast
each
worth
five
or
six
shillings
to
the
more
important
of
the
chiefs
for
calico
we
substituted
one
of
these
strong
gaudy
dresses
iron
spoons
a
knife
needles
a
tin
dish
or
pannikin
and
found
these
presents
to
be
valued
more
than
three
times
their
value
in
cloth
would
have
been
eight
or
ten
shillings
worth
gave
abundant
satisfaction
to
the
greediest
but
this
is
to
be
understood
as
the
prime
cost
of
the
articles
and
a
trader
would
sometimes
have
estimated
similar
generosity
as
equal
to
from
to
pounds
in
some
cases
the
presents
we
gave
exceeded
the
value
of
what
was
received
in
return
in
others
the
excess
of
generosity
was
on
the
native
side
we
never
asked
for
leave
to
pass
through
the
country
we
simply
told
where
we
were
going
and
asked
for
guides
if
they
were
refused
or
if
they
demanded
payment
beforehand
we
requested
to
be
put
into
the
beginning
of
the
path
and
said
that
we
were
sorry
we
could
not
agree
about
the
guides
and
usually
they
and
we
started
together
greater
care
would
be
required
on
entering
the
mazitu
or
zulu
country
for
there
the
government
extends
over
very
large
districts
while
among
the
manganja
each
little
district
is
independent
of
every
other
the
people
here
have
not
adopted
the
exacting
system
of
the
banyai
or
of
the
people
whose
country
was
traversed
by
speke
and
grant
in
our
way
back
from
chinsambas
to
chembis
and
from
his
village
to
nkwindas
and
thence
to
katosas
we
only
saw
the
people
working
in
their
gardens
near
to
the
stockades
these
strongholds
were
strengthened
with
branches
of
acacias
covered
with
strong
hooked
thorns
and
were
all
crowded
with
people
the
air
was
now
clearer
than
when
we
went
north
and
we
could
see
the
hills
of
kirks
range
five
or
six
miles
to
the
west
of
our
path
the
sun
struck
very
hot
and
the
men
felt
it
most
in
their
feet
every
one
who
could
get
a
bit
of
goatskin
made
it
into
a
pair
of
sandals
while
sitting
at
nkwindas
a
man
behind
the
court
hedgewall
said
with
great
apparent
glee
that
an
arab
slaving
party
on
the
other
side
of
the
confluence
of
the
shire
and
lake
were
giving
readily
two
fathoms
of
calico
for
a
boy
and
two
and
a
half
for
a
girl
never
saw
trade
so
brisk
no
haggling
at
all
this
party
was
purchasing
for
the
supply
of
the
ocean
slavetrade
one
of
the
evils
of
this
traffic
is
that
it
profits
by
every
calamity
that
happens
in
a
country
the
slavetrader
naturally
reaps
advantage
from
every
disorder
and
though
in
the
present
case
some
lives
may
have
been
saved
that
otherwise
would
have
perished
as
a
rule
he
intensifies
hatreds
and
aggravates
wars
between
the
tribes
because
the
more
they
fight
and
vanquish
each
other
the
richer
his
harvest
becomes
where
slaving
and
cattle
are
unknown
the
people
live
in
peace
as
we
sat
leaning
against
that
hedge
and
listened
to
the
harangue
of
the
slavetraders
agent
it
glanced
across
our
mind
that
this
was
a
terrible
world
the
best
in
it
unable
from
conscious
imperfections
to
say
to
the
worst
stand
by
for
i
am
holier
than
thou
the
slavetrader
imbued
no
doubt
with
certain
kindly
feelings
yet
pursuing
a
calling
which
makes
him
a
fair
specimen
of
a
human
fiend
stands
grouped
with
those
by
whom
the
slavetraders
are
employed
and
with
all
the
workers
of
sin
and
misery
in
more
highlyfavoured
lands
an
awful
picture
to
the
allseing
eye
we
arrived
at
katosas
village
on
the
th
october
and
found
about
thirty
young
men
and
boys
in
slavesticks
they
had
been
bought
by
other
agents
of
the
arab
slavers
still
on
the
east
side
of
the
shire
they
were
resting
in
the
village
and
their
owners
soon
removed
them
the
weight
of
the
goree
seemed
very
annoying
when
they
tried
to
sleep
this
taming
instrument
is
kept
on
until
the
party
has
crossed
several
rivers
and
all
hope
of
escape
has
vanished
from
the
captives
mind
on
explaining
to
katosa
the
injury
he
was
doing
in
selling
his
people
as
slaves
he
assured
us
that
those
whom
we
had
seen
belonged
to
the
arabs
and
added
that
he
had
far
too
few
people
already
he
said
he
had
been
living
in
peace
at
the
lakelet
pamalombe
that
the
ajawa
or
machinga
under
kainka
and
karamba
and
a
body
of
babisa
under
maonga
had
induced
him
to
ferry
them
over
the
shire
that
they
had
lived
for
a
considerable
time
at
his
expense
and
at
last
stole
his
sheep
which
induced
him
to
make
his
escape
to
the
place
where
he
now
dwelt
and
in
this
flight
he
had
lost
many
of
his
people
his
account
of
the
usual
conduct
of
the
ajawa
quite
agrees
with
what
these
people
have
narrated
themselves
and
gives
but
a
low
idea
of
their
moral
tone
they
have
repeatedly
broken
all
the
laws
of
hospitality
by
living
for
months
on
the
bounty
of
the
manganja
and
then
by
a
sudden
uprising
overcoming
their
hosts
and
killing
or
chasing
them
out
of
their
inheritances
the
secret
of
their
success
is
the
possession
of
firearms
there
were
several
of
these
ajawa
here
again
and
on
our
arrival
they
proposed
to
katosa
that
they
should
leave
but
he
replied
that
they
need
not
be
afraid
of
us
they
had
red
beads
strung
so
thickly
on
their
hair
that
at
a
little
distance
they
appeared
to
have
on
red
caps
it
is
curious
that
the
taste
for
red
hair
should
be
so
general
among
the
africans
here
and
further
north
in
the
south
black
mica
called
sebilo
and
even
soot
are
used
to
deepen
the
colour
of
the
hair
here
many
smear
the
head
with
redochre
others
plait
the
inner
bark
of
a
tree
stained
red
into
it
and
a
red
powder
called
mukuru
is
employed
which
some
say
is
obtained
from
the
ground
and
others
from
the
roots
of
a
tree
it
having
been
doubted
whether
sugarcane
is
indigenous
to
this
country
or
not
we
employed
katosa
to
procure
the
two
varieties
commonly
cultivated
with
the
intention
of
conveying
them
to
johanna
one
is
yellow
and
the
other
like
what
we
observed
in
the
barotse
valley
is
variegated
with
dark
red
and
yellow
patches
or
all
red
we
have
seen
it
arrow
or
blossom
bamboos
also
run
to
seed
and
the
people
are
said
to
use
the
seed
as
food
the
sugarcane
has
native
names
which
would
lead
us
to
believe
it
to
be
indigenous
here
it
is
called
zimbi
further
south
mesari
and
in
the
centre
of
the
country
meshuati
anything
introduced
in
recent
times
as
maize

cotton
or
cassava
has
a
name
implying
its
foreign
origin
katosas
village
was
embowered
among
gigantic
trees
of
fine
timber
several
caffiaceous
bushes
with
berries
closely
resembling
those
of
the
common
coffee
grew
near
but
no
use
had
ever
been
made
of
them
there
are
several
cinchonaceous
trees
also
in
the
country
and
some
of
the
wild
fruits
are
so
good
as
to
cause
a
feeling
of
regret
that
they
have
not
been
improved
by
cultivation
or
whatever
else
brought
ours
to
their
present
perfection
katosa
lamented
that
this
locality
was
so
inferior
to
his
former
place
at
pamalombe
there
he
had
maize
at
the
different
stages
of
growth
throughout
the
year
to
us
however
he
seemed
by
digging
holes
and
taking
advantage
of
the
moisture
beneath
to
have
succeeded
pretty
well
in
raising
crops
at
this
the
driest
time
the
makololo
remarked
that
here
the
maize
had
no
seasonmeaning
that
the
whole
year
was
proper
for
its
growth
and
ripening
by
irrigation
a
succession
of
crops
of
grain
might
be
raised
anywhere
within
the
south
intertropical
region
of
africa
when
we
were
with
motunda
on
the
th
october
he
told
us
frankly
that
all
the
native
provisions
were
hidden
in
kirks
range
and
his
village
being
the
last
place
where
a
supply
of
grain
could
be
purchased
before
we
reached
the
ship
we
waited
till
he
had
sent
to
his
hidden
stores
the
upland
country
beyond
the
mountains
now
on
our
right
is
called
deza
and
is
inhabited
by
maravi
who
are
only
another
tribe
of
manganja
the
paramount
chief
is
called
kabambe
and
he
having
never
been
visited
by
war
lives
in
peace
and
plenty
goats
and
sheep
thrive
and
nyango
the
chieftainess
further
to
the
south
has
herds
of
horned
cattle
the
country
being
elevated
is
said
to
be
cold
and
there
are
large
grassy
plains
on
it
which
are
destitute
of
trees
the
maravi
are
reported
to
be
brave
and
good
marksmen
with
the
bow
but
throughout
all
the
country
we
have
traversed
guns
are
enabling
the
trading
tribes
to
overcome
the
agricultural
and
manufacturing
classes
on
the
ascent
at
the
end
of
the
valley
just
opposite
mount
mvai
we
looked
back
for
a
moment
to
impress
the
beauties
of
the
grand
vale
on
our
memory
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
now
excessive
and
masiko
thinking
that
it
was
overpowering
proposed
to
send
forward
to
the
ship
and
get
a
hammock
in
which
to
carry
any
one
who
might
knock
up
he
was
truly
kind
and
considerate
dr
livingstone
having
fallen
asleep
after
a
fatiguing
march
a
hole
in
the
roof
of
the
hut
he
was
in
allowed
the
sun
to
beat
on
his
head
and
caused
a
splitting
headache
and
deafness
while
he
was
nearly
insensible
he
felt
masiko
repeatedly
lift
him
back
to
the
bed
off
which
he
had
rolled
and
cover
him
up
on
the
th
we
were
again
in
banda
at
the
village
of
chasundu
and
could
now
see
clearly
the
hot
valley
in
which
the
shire
flows
and
the
mountains
of
the
manganja
beyond
to
our
southeast
instead
of
following
the
road
by
which
we
had
come
we
resolved
to
go
south
along
the
lesungwe
which
rises
at
zunje
a
peak
on
the
same
ridge
as
mvai
and
a
part
of
kirks
range
which
bounds
the
country
of
the
maravi
on
our
west
this
is
about
the
limit
of
the
beat
of
the
portuguese
native
traders
and
it
is
but
recently
that
following
our
footsteps
they
have
come
so
far
it
is
not
likely
that
their
enterprise
will
lead
them
further
north
for
chasundu
informed
us
that
the
babisa
undersell
the
agents
from
tette
he
had
tried
to
deal
with
the
latter
when
they
first
came
but
they
offered
only
ten
fathoms
of
calico
for
a
tusk
for
which
the
babisa
gave
him
twenty
fathoms
and
a
little
powder
ivory
was
brought
to
us
for
sale
again
and
again
and
as
far
as
we
could
judge
the
price
expected
would
be
about
one
yard
of
calico
per
pound
or
possibly
more
for
there
is
no
scale
of
prices
known
the
rule
seems
to
be
that
buyer
and
seller
shall
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
in
trying
to
cheat
each
other
before
coming
to
any
conclusion
over
a
bargain
we
found
the
lesungwe
a
fine
stream
near
its
source
and
about
forty
feet
wide
and
kneedeep
when
joined
by
the
lekudzi
which
comes
down
from
the
maravi
country
guineafowl
abounded
but
no
grain
could
be
purchased
for
the
people
had
cultivated
only
the
holmes
along
the
banks
with
maize
and
pumpkins
time
enough
had
not
elapsed
since
the
slavetraders
invasion
and
destruction
of
their
stores
for
them
to
raise
crops
of
grain
on
the
adjacent
lands
to
deal
with
them
for
a
few
heads
of
maize
was
the
hungry
bargaining
with
the
famished
so
we
hastened
on
southwards
as
fast
as
the
excessive
heat
would
allow
us
it
was
impossible
to
march
in
the
middle
of
the
day
the
heat
was
so
intolerable
and
we
could
not
go
on
at
night
because
if
we
had
chanced
to
meet
any
of
the
inhabitants
we
should
have
been
taken
for
marauders
we
had
now
thunder
every
afternoon
but
while
occasional
showers
seemed
to
fall
at
different
parts
none
fell
on
us
the
air
was
deliciously
clear
and
revealed
all
the
landscape
covered
everywhere
with
forest
and
bounded
by
beautiful
mountains
on
the
st
october
we
reached
the
mukurumadse
after
having
travelled
geographical
miles
or
english
miles
in
a
straight
line
this
was
accomplished
in
fiftyfive
travelling
days
twelve
miles
per
diem
on
an
average
if
the
numerous
bendings
and
windings
and
ups
and
downs
of
the
paths
could
have
been
measured
too
the
distance
would
have
been
found
at
least
fifteen
miles
a
day
the
night
we
slept
at
the
mukurumadse
it
thundered
heavily
but
as
this
had
been
the
case
every
afternoon
and
no
rain
had
followed
we
erected
no
shelter
but
during
this
night
a
pouring
rain
came
on
when
very
tired
a
man
feels
determined
to
sleep
in
spite
of
everything
and
the
sound
of
dropping
water
is
said
to
be
conducive
to
slumber
but
that
does
not
refer
to
an
african
storm
if
when
half
asleep
in
spite
of
a
heavy
shower
on
the
back
of
the
head
he
unconsciously
turns
on
his
side
the
drops
from
the
branches
make
such
capital
shots
into
his
ear
that
the
brain
rings
again
we
were
off
next
morning
the
st
of
november
as
soon
as
the
day
dawned
in
walking
about
seven
miles
to
the
ship
our
clothes
were
thoroughly
dried
by
the
hot
sun
and
an
attack
of
fever
followed
we
relate
this
little
incident
to
point
out
the
almost
certain
consequence
of
getting
wet
in
this
climate
and
allowing
the
clothes
to
dry
on
the
person
even
if
we
walk
in
the
mornings
when
the
dew
is
on
the
grass
and
only
get
our
feet
and
legs
wet
a
very
uneasy
feeling
and
partial
fever
with
pains
in
the
limbs
ensue
and
continue
till
the
march
onwards
bathes
them
in
perspiration
had
bishop
mackenzie
been
aware
of
this
which
before
experience
alone
had
taught
us
entailed
many
a
severe
lesson
we
know
no
earthly
reason
why
his
valuable
life
might
not
have
been
spared
the
difference
between
getting
the
clothes
soaked
in
england
and
in
africa
is
this
in
the
cold
climate
the
patient
is
compelled
or
at
any
rate
warned
by
discomfort
to
resort
at
once
to
a
change
of
raiment
while
in
africa
it
is
cooling
and
rather
pleasant
to
allow
the
clothes
to
dry
on
the
person
a
missionary
in
proportion
as
he
possesses
an
athletic
frame
hardened
by
manly
exercises
in
addition
to
his
other
qualifications
will
excel
him
who
is
not
favoured
with
such
bodily
endowments
but
in
a
hot
climate
efficiency
mainly
depends
on
husbanding
the
resources
he
must
never
forget
that
in
the
tropics
he
is
an
exotic
plant

that
from

my
companion
thomas
ward
the
steward
after
having
performed
his
part
in
the
march
right
bravely
rejoined
his
comrades
stronger
than
he
had
ever
been
before
an
ajawa
chief
named
kapeni
had
so
much
confidence
in
the
english
name
that
he
with
most
of
his
people
visited
the
ship
and
asserted
that
nothing
would
give
his
countrymen
greater
pleasure
than
to
receive
the
associates
of
bishop
mackenzie
as
their
teachers
this
declaration
coupled
with
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
ajawa
was
very
gratifying
inasmuch
as
it
was
clear
that
no
umbrage
had
been
taken
at
the
check
which
the
bishop
had
given
to
their
slaving
their
consciences
had
told
them
that
the
course
he
had
pursued
was
right
when
we
returned
the
contrast
between
the
vegetation
about
muazis
and
that
near
the
ship
was
very
striking
we
had
come
so
quickly
down
that
while
on
the
plateau
in
latitude
degrees
s
the
young
leaves
had
in
many
cases
passed
from
the
pink
or
other
colour

have
on

coming
out
to
the
light
fresh
green
which
succeeds
it
here
on
the
borders
of
degrees
s
or
from
to
miles
distant
the
trees
were
still
bare
the
grey
colour
of
the
bark
predominating
over
every
other
hue
the
trees
in
the
tropics
here
have
a
very
wellmarked
annual
rest
on
the
rovuma
even
which
is
only
about
ten
degrees
from
the
equator
in
september
the
slopes
up
from
the
river
some
sixty
miles
inland
were
of
a
light
ashygrey
colour
and
on
ascending
them
we
found
that
the
majority
of
the
trees
were
without
leaves
those
of
the
bamboo
even
lay
crisp
and
crumpled
on
the
ground
as
the
sun
is
usually
hot
by
day
even
in
the
winter
this
withering
process
may
be
owing
to
the
cool
nights
africa
differing
so
much
from
central
india
in
the
fact
that
in

be
the
air
generally
cools
down
sufficiently
by
the
early
morning
watches
to
render
a
covering
or
even
a
blanket
agreeable
the
first
fortnight
after
our
return
to
the
ship
was
employed
in
the
delightful
process
of
resting
to
appreciate
which
a
man
must
have
gone
through
great
exertions
in
our
case
the
muscles
of
the
limbs
were
as
hard
as
boards
and
not
an
ounce
of
fat
existed
on
any
part
of
the
body
we
now
had
frequent
showers
but
these
being
only
the
earlier
rains
the
result
on
the
rise
of
the
river
was
but
a
few
inches
the
effect
of
these
rains
on
the
surrounding
scenery
was
beautiful
in
the
extreme
all
trace
of
the
dry
season
was
soon
obliterated
and
hills
and
mountains
from
base
to
summit
were
covered
with
a
mantle
of
living
green
the
sun
passed
us
on
his
way
south
without
causing
a
flood
so
all
our
hopes
of
a
release
were
centred
on
his
return
towards
the
equator
when
as
a
rule
the
waters
of
inundation
are
made
to
flow
up
to
this
time
the
rains
descended
simply
to
water
the
earth
fill
the
pools
and
make
ready
for
the
grand
overflow
for
which
we
had
still
to
wait
six
weeks
it
is
of
no
use
to
conceal
that
we
waited
with
much
chagrin
for
had
we
not
been
forced
to
return
from
the
highlands
west
of
nyassa
we
might
have
visited
lake
bemba
but
unavailing
regrets
are
poor
employment
for
the
mind
so
we
banished
them
to
the
best
of
our
power
about
the
middle
of
december
we
were
informed
that
bishop
mackenzies
successor
after
spending
a
few
months
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
about
as
high
as
ben
nevis
in
scotland
at
the
mouth
of
the
shire
where
there
were
few
or
no
people
to
be
taught
had
determined
to
leave
the
country
this
unfortunate
decision
was
communicated
to
us
at
the
same
time
that
six
of
the
boys
reared
by
bishop
mackenzie
were
sent
back
into
heathenism
the
boys
were
taken
to
a
place
about
seven
miles
from
the
ship
but
immediately
found
their
way
up
to
us
we
told
them
that
if
they
wished
to
remain
in
the
country
they
had
better
so
arrange
at
once
for
we
were
soon
to
leave
the
sequel
will
show
their
choice
as
soon
as
the
death
of
bishop
mackenzie
was
known
at
the
cape
dr
gray
the
excellent
bishop
there
proceeded
at
once
to
england
with
a
view
of
securing
an
early
appointment
of
another
head
to
the
mission
which
in
its
origin
owed
so
much
to
his
zeal
for
the
spread
of
the
gospel
among
the
heathen
and
whose
interests
he
had
continually
at
heart
about
the
middle
of
we
heard
that
dr
grays
efforts
had
been
successful
and
that
another
clergyman
would
soon
take
the
place
of
our
departed
friend
this
pleasing
intelligence
was
exceedingly
cheering
to
the
missionaries
and
gratifying
also
to
the
members
of
the
expedition
about
the
beginning
of
the
new
bishop
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
in
a
manofwar
and
after
some
delay
proceeded
inland
the
bishop
of
the
cape
had
taken
a
voyage
home
at
considerable
inconvenience
to
himself
for
the
sole
object
of
promoting
this
mission
to
the
heathen
and
it
was
somehow
expected
that
the
man
he
would
secure
would
be
an
image
of
himself
and
we
must
say
that
whatever
others
from
the
representations
that
have
gone
abroad
may
think
of
his
character
we
invariably
found
dr
gray
to
be
a
true
warmhearted
promoter
of
the
welfare
of
his
fellow
men
a
man
whose
courage
and
zeal
have
provoked
very
many
to
good
works
it
was
hoped
that
the
presence
of
a
new
head
to
the
mission
would
infuse
new
energy
and
life
into
the
small
band
of
missionaries
whose
ranks
had
been
thinned
by
death
and
who
though
discouraged
by
the
disasters
which
the
slave
war
and
famine
had
induced
and
also
dispirited
by
the
depressing
influences
of
a
low
and
unhealthy
position
in
the
swampy
shire
valley
were
yet
bravely
holding
out
till
the
muchneeded
moral
and
material
aid
should
arrive
we
believe
that
we
are
uttering
the
sentiments
of
many
devout
members
of
different
sections
of
christians
when
we
say
it
was
a
pity
that
the
mission
of
the
universities
was
abandoned
the
ground
had
been
consecrated
in
the
truest
sense
by
the
lives
of
those
brave
men
who
first
occupied
it
in
bare
justice
to
bishop
mackenzie
who
was
the
first
to
fall
it
must
be
said
that
the
repudiation
of
all
he
had
done
and
the
sudden
abandonment
of
all
that
had
cost
so
much
life
and
money
to
secure
was
a
serious
line
of
conduct
for
one
so
unversed
in
missionary
operations
as
his
successor
to
inaugurate
it
would
have
been
no
more
than
fair
that
bishop
tozer
before
winding
up
the
affairs
of
the
mission
should
actually
have
examined
the
highlands
of
the
upper
shire
he
would
thus
have
gratified
the
associates
of
his
predecessor
who
believed
that
the
highlands
had
never
had
a
fair
trial
and
he
would
have
gained
from
personal
observation
a
more
accurate
knowledge
of
the
country
and
the
people
than
he
could
possibly
have
become
possessed
of
by
information
gathered
chiefly
on
the
coast
with
this
examination
rather
than
with
a
stay
of
a
few
months
on
the
humid
dripping
top
of
misty
morambala
we
should
have
felt
much
more
satisfied
in
january
the
natives
all
confidently
asserted
that
at
next
full
moon
the
river
would
have
its
great
and
permanent
flood
it
had
several
times
risen
as
much
as
a
foot
but
fell
again
as
suddenly
it
was
curious
that
their
observation
coincided
exactly
with
ours
that
the
flood
of
inundation
happens
when
the
sun
comes
overhead
on
his
way
back
to
the
equator
we
mention
this
more
minutely
because
from
the
observation
of
several
years
we
believe
that
in
this
way
the
inundation
of
the
nile
is
to
be
explained
on
the
th
the
shire
suddenly
rose
several
feet
and
we
started
at
once
and
stopping
only
for
a
short
time
at
chibisas
to
bid
adieu
to
the
ajawa
and
makololo
who
had
been
extremely
useful
to
us
of
late
in
supplying
maize
and
fresh
provisions
we
hastened
on
our
way
to
the
ocean
in
order
to
keep
a
steerage
way
on
the
pioneer
we
had
to
go
quicker
than
the
stream
and
unfortunately
carried
away
her
rudder
in
passing
suddenly
round
a
bank
the
delay
required
for
the
repairs
prevented
our
reaching
morambala
till
the
nd
of
february
the
floodwater
ran
into
a
marsh
some
miles
above
the
mountain
and
became
as
black
as
ink
and
when
it
returned
again
to
the
river
emitted
so
strong
an
effluvium
of
sulphuretted
hydrogen
that
one
could
not
forget
for
an
instant
that
the
air
was
most
offensive
the
natives
said
this
stench
did
not
produce
disease
we
spent
one
night
in
it
and
suffered
no
ill
effects
though
we
fully
expected
an
attack
of
fever
next
morning
every
particle
of
white
paint
on
both
ships
was
so
deeply
blackened
that
it
could
not
be
cleaned
by
scrubbing
with
soap
and
water
the
brass
was
all
turned
to
a
bronze
colour
and
even
the
iron
and
ropes
had
taken
a
new
tint
this
is
an
additional
proof
that
malaria
and
offensive
effluvia
are
not
always
companions
we
did
not
suffer
more
from
fever
in
the
mangrove
swamps
where
we
inhaled
so
much
of
the
heavy
mousey
smell
that
it
was
distinguishable
in
the
odour
of
our
shirts
and
flannels
than
we
did
elsewhere
we
tarried
in
the
foul
and
blackening
emanations
from
the
marsh
because
we
had
agreed
to
receive
on
board
about
thirty
poor
orphan
boys
and
girls
and
a
few
helpless
widows
whom
bishop
mackenzie
had
attached
to
his
mission
all
who
were
able
to
support
themselves
had
been
encouraged
by
the
missionaries
to
do
so
by
cultivating
the
ground
and
they
now
formed
a
little
free
community
but
the
boys
and
girls
who
were
only
from
seven
to
twelve
years
of
age
and
orphans
without
any
one
to
help
them
could
not
be
abandoned
without
bringing
odium
on
the
english
name
the
effect
of
an
outcry
by
some
persons
in
england
who
knew
nothing
of
the
circumstances
in
which
bishop
mackenzie
was
placed
and
who
certainly
had
not
given
up
their
own
right
of
appeal
to
the
sword
of
the
magistrate
was
that
the
new
head
of
the
mission
had
gone
to
extremes
in
the
opposite
direction
from
his
predecessor
not
even
protesting
against
the
one
monstrous
evil
of
the
country
the
slavetrade
we
believed
that
we
ought
to
leave
the
english
name
in
the
same
good
repute
among
the
natives
that
we
had
found
it
and
in
removing
the
poor
creatures
who
had
lived
with
mackenzie
as
children
with
a
father
to
a
land
where
the
education
he
began
would
be
completed
we
had
the
aid
and
sympathy
of
the
best
of
the
portuguese
and
of
the
whole
population
the
difference
between
shipping
slaves
and
receiving
these
free
orphans
struck
us
as
they
came
on
board
as
soon
as
permission
to
embark
was
given
the
rush
into
the
boat
nearly
swamped
hertheir
eagerness
to
be
safe
on
the
pioneers
deck
had
to
be
repressed
bishop
tozer
had
already
left
for
quillimane
when
we
took
these
people
and
the
last
of
the
universities
missionaries
on
board
and
proceeded
to
the
zambesi
it
was
in
high
flood
we
have
always
spoken
of
this
river
as
if
at
its
lowest
for
fear
lest
we
should
convey
an
exaggerated
impression
of
its
capabilities
for
navigation
instead
of
from
five
to
fifteen
feet
it
was
now
from
fifteen
to
thirty
feet
or
more
deep
all
the
sandbanks
and
many
of
the
islands
had
disappeared
and
before
us
rolled
a
river
capable
as
one
of
our
naval
friends
thought
of
carrying
a
gunboat
some
of
the
sandy
islands
are
annually
swept
away
and
the
quantities
of
sand
carried
down
are
prodigious
the
process
by
which
a
delta
extending
eighty
or
one
hundred
miles
from
the
sea
has
been
formed
may
be
seen
going
on
at
the
present
daythe
coarser
particles
of
sand
are
driven
out
into
the
ocean
just
in
the
same
way
as
we
see
they
are
over
banks
in
the
beds
of
torrents
the
finer
portions
are
caught
by
the
returning
tide
and
accumulating
by
successive
ebbs
and
flows
become
with
the
decaying
vegetation
arrested
by
the
mangrove
roots
the
influence
of
the
tide
in
bringing
back
the
finer
particles
gives
the
sea
near
the
mouth
of
the
zambesi
a
clean
and
sandy
bottom
this
process
has
been
going
on
for
ages
and
as
the
delta
has
enlarged
eastwards
the
river
has
always
kept
a
channel
for
itself
behind
wherever
we
see
an
island
all
sand
or
with
only
one
layer
of
mud
in
it
we
know
it
is
one
of
recent
formation
and
that
it
may
be
swept
away
at
any
time
by
a
flood
while
those
islands
which
are
all
of
mud
are
the
more
ancient
having
in
fact
existed
ever
since
the
time
when
the
ebbing
and
flowing
tides
originally
formed
them
as
parts
of
the
delta
this
mud
resists
the
action
of
the
river
wonderfully
it
is
a
kind
of
clay
on
which
the
eroding
power
of
water
has
little
effect
were
maps
made
showing
which
banks
and
which
islands
are
liable
to
erosion
it
would
go
far
to
settle
where
the
annual
change
of
the
channel
would
take
place
and
were
a
few
stakes
driven
in
year
by
year
to
guide
the
water
in
its
course
the
river
might
be
made
of
considerable
commercial
value
in
the
hands
of
any
energetic
european
nation
no
canal
or
railway
would
ever
be
thought
of
for
this
part
of
africa
a
few
improvements
would
make
the
zambesi
a
ready
means
of
transit
for
all
the
trade
that
with
a
population
thinned
by
portuguese
slaving
will
ever
be
developed
in
our
day
here
there
is
no
instance
on
record
of
the
natives
flocking
in
thousands
to
the
colony
as
they
did
at
natal
and
even
to
the
arabs
on
lake
nyassa
this
keeping
aloof
renders
it
unlikely
that
in
portuguese
hands
the
zambesi
will
ever
be
of
any
more
value
to
the
world
than
it
has
been
after
a
hurried
visit
to
senna
in
order
to
settle
with
major
sicard
and
senhor
ferrao
for
supplies
we
had
drawn
thence
after
the
depopulation
of
the
shire
we
proceeded
down
to
the
zambesis
mouth
and
were
fortunate
in
meeting
on
the
th
february
with
hms
orestes
she
was
joined
next
day
by
hms
ariel
the
orestes
took
the
pioneer
and
the
ariel
the
lady
nyassa
in
tow
for
mosambique
on
the
th
a
circular
storm
proved
the
seagoing
qualities
of
the
lady
of
the
lake
for
on
this
day
a
hurricane
struck
the
ariel
and
drove
her
nearly
backwards
at
a
rate
of
six
knots
the
towing
hawser
wound
round
her
screw
and
stopped
her
engines
no
sooner
had
she
recovered
from
this
shock
than
she
was
again
taken
aback
on
the
other
tack
and
driven
stem
on
towards
the
lady
nyassas
broadside
we
who
were
on
board
the
little
vessel
saw
no
chance
of
escape
unless
the
crew
of
the
ariel
should
think
of
heaving
ropes
when
the
big
ship
went
over
us
but
she
glided
past
our
bow
and
we
breathed
freely
again
we
had
now
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
manofwar
seamanship
captain
chapman
though
his
engines
were
disabled
did
not
think
of
abandoning
us
in
the
heavy
gale
but
crossed
the
bows
of
the
lady
nyassa
again
and
again
dropping
a
cask
with
a
line
by
which
to
give
us
another
hawser
we
might
never
have
picked
it
up
had
not
a
krooman
jumped
overboard
and
fastened
a
second
line
to
the
cask
and
then
we
drew
the
hawser
on
board
and
were
again
in
tow
during
the
whole
time
of
the
hurricane
the
little
vessel
behaved
admirably
and
never
shipped
a
single
green
sea
when
the
ariel
pitched
forwards
we
could
see
a
large
part
of
her
bottom
and
when
her
stern
went
down
we
could
see
all
her
deck
a
boat
hung
at
her
stern
davits
was
stove
in
by
the
waves
the
officers
on
board
the
ariel
thought
that
it
was
all
over
with
us
we
imagined
that
they
were
suffering
more
than
we
were
nautical
men
may
suppose
that
this
was
a
serious
storm
only
to
landsmen
but
the
orestes
which
was
once
in
sight
and
at
another
time
forty
miles
off
during
the
same
gale
split
eighteen
sails
and
the
pioneer
had
to
be
lightened
of
parts
of
a
sugar
mill
she
was
carrying
her
roundhouse
was
washed
away
and
the
cabin
was
frequently
kneedeep
in
water
when
the
orestes
came
into
mosambique
harbour
nine
days
after
our
arrival
there
our
vessel
not
being
anchored
close
to
the
ariel
for
we
had
run
in
under
the
lee
of
the
fort
led
to
the
surmise
on
board
the
orestes
that
we
had
gone
to
the
bottom
captain
chapman
and
his
officers
pronounced
the
lady
nyassa
to
be
the
finest
little
seaboat
they
had
ever
seen
she
certainly
was
a
contrast
to
the
marobert
and
did
great
credit
to
her
builders
ted
and
macgregor
of
glasgow
we
can
but
regret
that
she
was
not
employed
on
the
lake
after
which
she
was
named
and
for
which
she
was
intended
and
was
so
well
adapted
what
struck
us
most
during
the
trip
from
the
zambesi
to
mosambique
was
the
admirable
way
in
which
captain
chapman
handled
the
ariel
in
the
heavy
sea
of
the
hurricane
the
promptitude
and
skill
with
which
when
we
had
broken
three
hawsers
others
were
passed
to
us
by
the
rapid
evolutions
of
a
big
ship
round
a
little
one
and
the
ready
appliance
of
means
shown
in
cutting
the
hawser
off
the
screw
nine
feet
under
water
with
long
chisels
made
for
the
occasion
a
task
which
it
took
three
days
to
accomplish
captain
chapman
very
kindly
invited
us
on
board
the
ariel
and
we
accepted
his
hospitality
after
the
weather
had
moderated
the
little
vessel
was
hauled
through
and
against
the
huge
seas
with
such
force
that
two
hawsers
measuring
eleven
inches
each
in
circumference
parted
many
of
the
blows
we
received
from
the
billows
made
every
plate
quiver
from
stem
to
stern
and
the
motion
was
so
quick
that
we
had
to
hold
on
continually
to
avoid
being
tossed
from
one
side
to
the
other
or
into
the
sea
ten
of
the
late
bishops
flock
whom
we
had
on
board
became
so
sick
and
helpless
that
do
what
we
could
to
aid
them
they
were
so
very
much
in
the
way
that
the
idea
broke
in
upon
us
that
the
close
packing
resorted
to
by
slavers
is
one
of
the
necessities
of
the
traffic
if
this
is
so
it
would
account
for
the
fact
that
even
when
the
trade
was
legal
the
same
injurious
custom
was
common
if
not
universal
if
instead
of
ten
such
passengers
we
had
been
carrying
two
hundred
with
the
wind
driving
the
rain
and
spray
as
by
night
it
did
nearly
as
hard
as
hail
against
our
faces
and
nothing
whatever
to
be
seen
to
windward
but
the
occasional
gleam
of
the
crest
of
a
wave
and
no
sound
heard
save
the
whistling
of
the
storm
through
the
rigging
it
would
have
been
absolutely
necessary
for
the
working
of
the
ship
and
safety
of
the
whole
that
the
live
cargo
should
all
have
been
stowed
down
below
whatever
might
have
been
the
consequences
having
delivered
the
pioneer
over
to
the
navy
she
was
towed
down
to
the
cape
by
captain
forsyth
of
the
valorous
and
after
examination
it
was
declared
that
with
repairs
to
the
amount
of
pounds
she
would
be
as
serviceable
as
ever
those
of
the
bishops
flock
whom
we
had
on
board
were
kindly
allowed
a
passage
to
the
cape
the
boys
went
in
the
orestes
and
we
are
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
record
our
heartfelt
thanks
to
captains
forsyth
gardner
and
chapman
for
rendering
us
at
various
times
every
aid
in
their
power
mr
waller
went
in
the
pioneer
and
continued
his
generous
services
to
all
connected
with
the
mission
whether
white
or
black
till
they
were
no
longer
needed
and
we
must
say
that
his
conduct
to
them
throughout
was
truly
noble
and
worthy
of
the
highest
praise
after
beaching
the
lady
nyassa
at
caboceira
opposite
the
house
of
a
portuguese
gentleman
well
known
to
all
englishmen
joao
da
costa
soares
we
put
in
brine
cocks
and
cleaned
and
painted
her
bottom
mr
soares
appeared
to
us
to
have
been
very
much
vilified
in
a
publication
in
england
a
few
years
ago
our
experience
proved
him
to
be
extremely
kind
and
obliging
all
the
members
of
the
expedition
who
passed
mosambique
were
unanimous
in
extolling
his
generosity
and
from
the
general
testimony
of
english
visitors
in
his
favour
we
very
much
regret
that
his
character
was
so
grievously
misrepresented
to
the
authorities
at
mosambique
our
thanks
are
also
due
for
obliging
accommodation
and
though
we
differ
entirely
from
the
portuguese
officials
as
to
the
light
in
which
we
regard
the
slavetrade
we
trust
our
exposure
of
the
system
in
which
unfortunately
they
are
engaged
will
not
be
understood
as
indicating
any
want
of
kindly
feeling
and
good
will
to
them
personally
senhor
canto
e
castro
who
arrived
at
mosambique
two
days
after
our
departure
to
take
the
office
of
governorgeneral
was
well
known
to
us
in
angola
we
lived
two
months
in
his
house
when
he
was
commandant
of
golungo
alto
and
knowing
him
thoroughly
believe
that
no
better
man
could
have
been
selected
for
the
office
we
trust
that
his
good
principles
may
enable
him
to
withstand
the
temptations
of
his
position
but
we
should
be
sorry
to
have
ours
tried
in
a
den
of
slavetraders
with
the
miserable
pittance
he
receives
for
his
support
while
at
mosambique
a
species
of
pedalia
called
by
mr
soares
dadeleira
and
by
the
nativesfrom
its
resemblance
to
gerzilin
or
sesamumwild
sesamum
was
shown
to
us
and
is
said
to
be
well
known
among
native
nurses
as
a
very
gentle
and
tasteless
aperient
for
children
a
few
leaves
of
it
are
stirred
in
a
cup
of
cold
water
for
eight
or
nine
seconds
and
a
couple
of
teaspoonfuls
of
the
liquid
given
as
a
dose
the
leaves
form
a
sort
of
mucilage
in
the
water
by
longer
stirring
which
is
said
to
have
diuretic
properties
besides
on
the
th
april
we
steamed
out
from
mosambique
and
the
currents
being
in
our
favour
in
a
week
reached
zanzibar
here
we
experienced
much
hospitality
from
our
countrymen
and
especially
from
dr
seward
then
acting
consul
and
political
agent
for
colonel
playfair
dr
seward
was
very
doubtful
if
we
could
reach
bombay
before
what
is
called
the
break
of
the
monsoon
took
place
this
break
occurs
usually
between
the
end
of
may
and
the
th
of
june
the
wind
still
blows
from
africa
to
india
but
with
so
much
violence
and
with
such
a
murky
atmosphere
that
few
or
no
observations
for
position
can
be
taken
we
were
however
at
the
time
very
anxious
to
dispose
of
the
lady
nyassa
and
the
only
market
we
could
reach
being
bombay
we
resolved
to
run
the
risk
of
getting
there
before
the
stormy
period
commenced
and
after
taking
fourteen
tons
of
coal
on
board
we
started
on
the
th
april
from
zanzibar
our
complement
consisted
of
seven
native
zambesians
two
boys
and
four
europeans
namely
one
stoker
one
sailor
one
carpenter
whose
names
have
been
already
mentioned
and
dr
livingstone
as
navigator
the
lady
nyassa
had
shown
herself
to
be
a
good
seaboat
the
natives
had
proved
themselves
capital
sailors
though
before
volunteering
not
one
of
them
had
ever
seen
the
sea
they
were
not
picked
men
but
on
paying
a
dozen
whom
we
had
in
our
employment
for
fifteen
months
they
were
taken
at
random
from
several
hundreds
who
offered
to
accompany
us
their
wages
were
ten
shillings
per
mensem
and
it
was
curious
to
observe
that
so
eager
were
they
to
do
their
duty
that
only
one
of
them
lay
down
from
sea
sickness
during
the
whole
voyage
they
took
in
and
set
sail
very
cleverly
in
a
short
time
and
would
climb
out
along
a
boom
reeve
a
rope
through
the
block
and
come
back
with
the
rope
in
their
teeth
though
at
each
lurch
the
performer
was
dipped
in
the
sea
the
sailor
and
carpenter
though
anxious
to
do
their
utmost
had
a
weeks
severe
illness
each
and
were
unfit
for
duty
it
is
pleasant
enough
to
take
the
wheel
for
an
hour
or
two
or
even
for
a
watch
but
when
it
comes
to
be
for
every
alternate
four
hours
it
is
utterly
wearisome
we
set
our
black
men
to
steer
showing
them
which
arm
of
the
compass
needle
was
to
be
kept
towards
the
vessels
head
and
soon
three
of
them
could
manage
very
well
and
they
only
needed
watching
in
going
up
the
east
coast
to
take
advantage
of
the
current
of
one
hundred
miles
a
day
we
would
fain
have
gone
into
the
juba
or
webbe
river
the
mouth
of
which
is
only
minutes
south
of
the
line
but
we
were
too
shorthanded
we
passed
up
to
about
ten
degrees
north
of
the
equator
and
then
steamed
out
from
the
coast
here
maurys
wind
chart
showed
that
the
calmbelt
had
long
been
passed
but
we
were
in
it
still
and
instead
of
a
current
carrying
us
north
we
had
a
contrary
current
which
bore
us
every
day
four
miles
to
the
south
we
steamed
as
long
as
we
dared
knowing
as
we
did
that
we
must
use
the
engines
on
the
coast
of
india
after
losing
many
days
tossing
on
the
silent
sea
with
innumerable
dolphins
flyingfish
and
sharks
around
us
we
had
six
days
of
strong
breezes
then
calms
again
tried
our
patience
and
the
near
approach
of
that
period
the
break
of
the
monsoon
in
which
it
was
believed
no
boat
could
live
made
us
sometimes
think
our
epitaph
would
be
left
zanzibar
on
th
april
and
never
more
heard
of
at
last
in
the
beginning
of
june
the
chronometers
showed
that
we
were
near
the
indian
coast
the
black
men
believed
it
was
true
because
we
told
them
it
was
so
but
only
began
to
dance
with
joy
when
they
saw
seaweed
and
serpents
floating
past
these
serpents
are
peculiar
to
these
parts
and
are
mentioned
as
poisonous
in
the
sailing
directions
we
ventured
to
predict
that
we
should
see
land
next
morning
and
at
midday
the
high
coast
hove
in
sight
wonderfully
like
africa
before
the
rains
begin
then
a
haze
covered
all
the
land
and
a
heavy
swell
beat
towards
it
a
rock
was
seen
and
a
latitude
showed
it
to
be
the
choule
rock
making
that
a
fresh
starting
point
we
soon
found
the
lightship
and
then
the
forest
of
masts
loomed
through
the
haze
in
bombay
harbour
we
had
sailed
over
miles
footnotes
a
remedy
composed
of
from
six
to
eight
grains
of
resin
of
jalap

same
of
rhubarb
and
three

of
calomel
and
quinine
made
up
into
four
pills
with
tincture
of
cardamoms
usually
relieved
all
the
symptoms
in
five
or
six
hours
four
pills
are
a
full
dose
for
a
manone
will
suffice
for
a
woman

received
from
our
men
the
name
of
rousers
from
their
efficacy
in
rousing
up
even
those
most
prostrated
when
their
operation
is
delayed
a
dessertspoonful
of
epsom
salts
should
be
given

after
or
during
the
operation
of
the
pills
in
large
doses
every
two
or
three
hours
until
deafness
or
cinchonism
ensued
completed
the
cure
the
only
cases
in
which
we
found
ourselves
completely
helpless
were
those
in
which
obstinate
vomiting
ensued
the
late
mr
robson
in
four
years
after
these
forebodings
were
penned
we
received
intelligence
that
they
had
all
come
to

of

has
suffered
the
usual
fate
of

that
fate
we
deeply
deplore
for
whatever
other
faults
the
makololo
might
justly
be
charged
with
they

not

to
the
class
who
buy
and

and
the
tribes
who
have
succeeded

it
was
with
sorrow
that
we
learned
by
a
letter
from
mr
moffat
in
that
poor
sekeletu
was
dead
as
will
be
mentioned
further
on
men
were
sent
with
us
to
bring
up
more
medicine
they
preferred
to
remain
on
the
shire
and
as
they
were
free
men
we
could
do
no
more
than
try
and
persuade
them
to
hasten
back
to
their
chief
with
iodine
and
other
remedies
they
took
the
parcel
but
there
being
only
two
real
makololo
among
them
these
could
neither
return
themselves
alone

force
their
