when
the
morning
was
come
all
the
chief
priests
and
elders
of
the
people
took
counsel
against
jesus
to
put
him
to
death
and
when
they
had
bound
him
they
led
him
away
and
delivered
him
to
pontius
pilate
the
governor
then
judas
which
had
betrayeth
him
when
he
saw
that
he
was
condemned
repented
himself
and
brought
again
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
to
the
chief
priests
and
elders
saying
i
have
sinned
in
that
i
have
betrayed
the
innocent
blood
and
they
said
what
is
that
to
us
see
thou
to
that
and
he
cast
down
the
pieces
of
silver
in
the
temple
and
departed
and
went
and
hanged
himself
and
the
chief
priests
took
the
silver
pieces
and
said
it
is
not
lawful
for
to
put
them
into
the
treasury
because
it
is
the
price
of
blood
and
they
took
counsel
and
bought
with
them
the
potters
field
to
bury
strangers
in
wherefore
that
field
was
called
the
field
of
blood
unto
this
day
then
was
fulfilled
that
which
was
spoken
by
jeremy
the
prophet
saying
and
they
took
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
the
price
of
him
that
was
valued
whom
they
of
the
children
of
israel
did
value
and
gave
them
for
the
potters
field
as
the
lord
appointed
me
and
jesus
stood
before
the
governor
and
the
governor
asked
him
saying
art
thou
the
king
of
the
jews
and
jesus
said
unto
him
thou
sayest
and
when
he
was
accused
of
the
chief
priests
and
elders
he
answered
nothing
then
said
pilate
unto
him
hearest
thou
not
how
many
things
they
witness
against
thee
and
he
answered
him
to
never
a
word
insomuch
that
the
governor
marvelled
greatly
now
at
that
feast
the
governor
was
wont
to
release
unto
the
people
a
prisoner
whom
they
would
and
they
had
then
a
notable
prisoner
called
barabbas
therefore
when
they
were
gathered
together
pilate
said
unto
them
whom
will
ye
that
i
release
unto
you
barabbas
or
jesus
which
is
called
christ
for
he
knew
that
for
envy
they
had
delivered
him
when
he
was
set
down
on
the
judgment
seat
his
wife
sent
unto
him
saying
have
thou
nothing
to
do
with
that
just
man
for
i
have
suffered
many
things
this
day
in
a
dream
because
of
him
but
the
chief
priests
and
elders
persuaded
the
multitude
that
they
should
ask
barabbas
and
destroy
jesus
the
governor
answered
and
said
unto
them
whether
of
the
twain
will
ye
that
i
release
unto
you
they
said
barabbas
pilate
saith
unto
them
what
shall
i
do
then
with
jesus
which
is
called
christ
they
all
say
unto
him
let
him
be
crucified
and
the
governor
said
why
what
evil
hath
he
done
but
they
cried
out
the
more
saying
let
him
be
crucified
when
pilate
saw
that
he
could
prevail
nothing
but
that
rather
a
tumult
was
made
he
took
water
and
washed
his
hands
before
the
multitude
saying
i
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
person
see
ye
to
it
then
answered
all
the
people
and
said
his
blood
be
on
us
and
on
our
children
then
released
he
barabbas
unto
them
and
when
he
had
scourged
jesus
he
delivered
him
to
be
crucified
then
the
soldiers
of
the
governor
took
jesus
into
the
common
hall
and
gathered
unto
him
the
whole
band
of
soldiers
and
they
stripped
him
and
put
on
him
a
scarlet
robe
and
when
they
had
platted
a
crown
of
thorns
they
put
it
upon
his
head
and
a
reed
in
his
right
hand
and
they
bowed
the
knee
before
him
and
mocked
him
saying
hail
king
of
the
jews
and
they
spit
upon
him
and
took
the
reed
and
smote
him
on
the
head
and
after
that
they
had
mocked
him
they
took
the
robe
off
from
him
and
put
his
own
raiment
on
him
and
led
him
away
to
crucify
him
and
as
they
came
out
they
found
a
man
of
cyrene
simon
by
name
him
they
compelled
to
bear
his
cross
and
when
they
were
come
unto
a
place
called
golgotha
that
is
to
say
a
place
of
a
skull
they
gave
him
vinegar
to
drink
mingled
with
gall
and
when
he
had
tasted
thereof
he
would
not
drink
and
they
crucified
him
and
parted
his
garments
casting
lots
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
they
parted
my
garments
among
them
and
upon
my
vesture
did
they
cast
lots
and
sitting
down
they
watched
him
there
and
set
up
over
his
head
his
accusation
written
this
is
jesus
the
king
of
the
jews
then
were
there
two
thieves
crucified
with
him
one
on
the
right
hand
and
another
on
the
left
and
they
that
passed
by
reviled
him
wagging
their
heads
and
saying
thou
that
destroyest
the
temple
and
buildest
it
in
three
days
save
thyself
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
come
down
from
the
cross
likewise
also
the
chief
priests
mocking
him
with
the
scribes
and
elders
said
he
saved
others
himself
he
cannot
save
if
he
be
the
king
of
israel
let
him
now
come
down
from
the
cross
and
we
will
believe
him
he
trusted
in
god
let
him
deliver
him
now
if
he
will
have
him
for
he
said
i
am
the
son
of
god
the
thieves
also
which
were
crucified
with
him
cast
the
same
in
his
teeth
now
from
the
sixth
hour
there
was
darkness
over
all
the
land
unto
the
ninth
hour
and
about
the
ninth
hour
jesus
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
eli
eli
lama
sabachthani
that
is
to
say
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
some
of
them
that
stood
there
when
they
heard
that
said
this
man
calleth
for
elias
and
straightway
one
of
them
ran
and
took
a
spunge
and
filled
it
with
vinegar
and
put
it
on
a
reed
and
gave
him
to
drink
the
rest
said
let
be
let
us
see
whether
elias
will
come
to
save
him
jesus
when
he
had
cried
again
with
a
loud
voice
yielded
up
the
ghost
and
behold
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
twain
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
and
the
earth
did
quake
and
the
rocks
rent
and
the
graves
were
opened
and
many
bodies
of
the
saints
which
slept
arose
and
came
out
of
the
graves
after
his
resurrection
and
went
into
the
holy
city
and
appeared
unto
many
now
when
the
centurion
and
they
that
were
with
him
watching
jesus
saw
the
earthquake
and
those
things
that
were
done
they
feared
greatly
saying
truly
this
was
the
son
of
god
and
many
women
were
there
beholding
afar
off
which
followed
jesus
from
galilee
ministering
unto
him
among
which
was
mary
magdalene
and
mary
the
mother
of
james
and
joses
and
the
mother
of
zebedees
children
when
the
even
was
come
there
came
a
rich
man
of
arimathaea
named
joseph
who
also
himself
was
jesus
disciple
he
went
to
pilate
and
begged
the
body
of
jesus
then
pilate
commanded
the
body
to
be
delivered
and
when
joseph
had
taken
the
body
he
wrapped
it
in
a
clean
linen
cloth
and
laid
it
in
his
own
new
tomb
which
he
had
hewn
out
in
the
rock
and
he
rolled
a
great
stone
to
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
and
departed
and
there
was
mary
magdalene
and
the
other
mary
sitting
over
against
the
sepulchre
now
the
next
day
that
followed
the
day
of
the
preparation
the
chief
priests
and
pharisees
came
together
unto
pilate
saying
sir
we
remember
that
that
deceiver
said
while
he
was
yet
alive
after
three
days
i
will
rise
again
command
therefore
that
the
sepulchre
be
made
sure
until
the
third
day
lest
his
disciples
come
by
night
and
steal
him
away
and
say
unto
the
people
he
is
risen
from
the
dead
so
the
last
error
shall
be
worse
than
the
first
pilate
said
unto
them
ye
have
a
watch
go
your
way
make
it
as
sure
as
ye
can
so
they
went
and
made
the
sepulchre
sure
sealing
the
stone
and
setting
a
watch
