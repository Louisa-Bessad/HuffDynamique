then
was
jesus
led
up
of
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
to
be
tempted
of
the
devil
and
when
he
had
fasted
forty
days
and
forty
nights
he
was
afterward
an
hungred
and
when
the
tempter
came
to
him
he
said
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
command
that
these
stones
be
made
bread
but
he
answered
and
said
it
is
written
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
then
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
the
holy
city
and
setteth
him
on
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
saith
unto
him
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
cast
thyself
down
for
it
is
written
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
concerning
thee
and
in
their
hands
they
shall
bear
thee
up
lest
at
any
time
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone
jesus
said
unto
him
it
is
written
again
thou
shalt
not
tempt
the
lord
thy
god
again
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain
and
sheweth
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
the
glory
of
them
and
saith
unto
him
all
these
things
will
i
give
thee
if
thou
wilt
fall
down
and
worship
me
then
saith
jesus
unto
him
get
thee
hence
satan
for
it
is
written
thou
shalt
worship
the
lord
thy
god
and
him
only
shalt
thou
serve
then
the
devil
leaveth
him
and
behold
angels
