for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
man
that
is
an
householder
which
went
out
early
in
the
morning
to
hire
labourers
into
his
vineyard
and
when
he
had
agreed
with
the
labourers
for
a
penny
a
day
he
sent
them
into
his
vineyard
and
he
went
out
about
the
third
hour
and
saw
others
standing
idle
in
the
marketplace
and
said
unto
them
go
ye
also
into
the
vineyard
and
whatsoever
is
right
i
will
give
you
and
they
went
their
way
again
he
went
out
about
the
sixth
and
ninth
hour
and
did
likewise
and
about
the
eleventh
hour
he
went
out
and
found
others
standing
idle
and
saith
unto
them
why
stand
ye
here
all
the
day
idle
they
say
unto
him
because
no
man
hath
hired
us
he
saith
unto
them
go
ye
also
into
the
vineyard
and
whatsoever
is
right
that
shall
ye
receive
so
when
even
was
come
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
saith
unto
his
steward
call
the
labourers
and
give
them
their
hire
beginning
from
the
last
unto
the
first
and
when
they
came
that
were
hired
about
the
eleventh
hour
they
received
every
man
a
penny
but
when
the
first
came
they
supposed
that
they
should
have
received
more
and
they
likewise
received
every
man
a
penny
and
when
they
had
received
it
they
murmured
against
the
goodman
of
the
house
saying
these
last
have
wrought
but
one
hour
and
thou
hast
made
them
equal
unto
us
which
have
borne
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
but
he
answered
one
of
them
and
said
friend
i
do
thee
no
wrong
didst
not
thou
agree
with
me
for
a
penny
take
that
thine
is
and
go
thy
way
i
will
give
unto
this
last
even
as
unto
thee
is
it
not
lawful
for
me
to
do
what
i
will
with
mine
own
is
thine
eye
evil
because
i
am
good
so
the
last
shall
be
first
and
the
first
last
for
many
be
called
but
few
chosen
and
jesus
going
up
to
jerusalem
took
the
twelve
disciples
apart
in
the
way
and
said
unto
them
behold
we
go
up
to
jerusalem
and
the
son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
unto
the
chief
priests
and
unto
the
scribes
and
they
shall
condemn
him
to
death
and
shall
deliver
him
to
the
gentiles
to
mock
and
to
scourge
and
to
crucify
him
and
the
third
day
he
shall
rise
again
then
came
to
him
the
mother
of
zebedees
children
with
her
sons
worshipping
him
and
desiring
a
certain
thing
of
him
and
he
said
unto
her
what
wilt
thou
she
saith
unto
him
grant
that
these
my
two
sons
may
sit
the
one
on
thy
right
hand
and
the
other
on
the
left
in
thy
kingdom
but
jesus
answered
and
said
ye
know
not
what
ye
ask
are
ye
able
to
drink
of
the
cup
that
i
shall
drink
of
and
to
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
i
am
baptized
with
they
say
unto
him
we
are
able
and
he
saith
unto
them
ye
shall
drink
indeed
of
my
cup
and
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
i
am
baptized
with
but
to
sit
on
my
right
hand
and
on
my
left
is
not
mine
to
give
but
it
shall
be
given
to
them
for
whom
it
is
prepared
of
my
father
and
when
the
ten
heard
it
they
were
moved
with
indignation
against
the
two
brethren
but
jesus
called
them
unto
him
and
said
ye
know
that
the
princes
of
the
gentiles
exercise
dominion
over
them
and
they
that
are
great
exercise
authority
upon
them
but
it
shall
not
be
so
among
you
but
whosoever
will
be
great
among
you
let
him
be
your
minister
and
whosoever
will
be
chief
among
you
let
him
be
your
servant
even
as
the
son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
and
to
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
many
and
as
they
departed
from
jericho
a
great
multitude
followed
him
and
behold
two
blind
men
sitting
by
the
way
side
when
they
heard
that
jesus
passed
by
cried
out
saying
have
mercy
on
us
o
lord
thou
son
of
david
and
the
multitude
rebuked
them
because
they
should
hold
their
peace
but
they
cried
the
more
saying
have
mercy
on
us
o
lord
thou
son
of
david
and
jesus
stood
still
and
called
them
and
said
what
will
ye
that
i
shall
do
unto
you
they
say
unto
him
lord
that
our
eyes
may
be
opened
so
jesus
had
compassion
on
them
and
touched
their
eyes
and
immediately
their
eyes
received
sight
and
they
followed
him
