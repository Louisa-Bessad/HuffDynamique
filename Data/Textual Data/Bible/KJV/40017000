and
after
six
days
jesus
taketh
peter
james
and
john
his
brother
and
bringeth
them
up
into
an
high
mountain
apart
and
was
transfigured
before
them
and
his
face
did
shine
as
the
sun
and
his
raiment
was
white
as
the
light
and
behold
there
appeared
unto
them
moses
and
elias
talking
with
him
then
answered
peter
and
said
unto
jesus
lord
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here
if
thou
wilt
let
us
make
here
three
tabernacles
one
for
thee
and
one
for
moses
and
one
for
elias
while
he
yet
spake
behold
a
bright
cloud
overshadowed
them
and
behold
a
voice
out
of
the
cloud
which
said
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
hear
ye
him
and
when
the
disciples
heard
it
they
fell
on
their
face
and
were
sore
afraid
and
jesus
came
and
touched
them
and
said
arise
and
be
not
afraid
and
when
they
had
lifted
up
their
eyes
they
saw
no
man
save
jesus
only
and
as
they
came
down
from
the
mountain
jesus
charged
them
saying
tell
the
vision
to
no
man
until
the
son
of
man
be
risen
again
from
the
dead
and
his
disciples
asked
him
saying
why
then
say
the
scribes
that
elias
must
first
come
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
elias
truly
shall
first
come
and
restore
all
things
but
i
say
unto
you
that
elias
is
come
already
and
they
knew
him
not
but
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
listed
likewise
shall
also
the
son
of
man
suffer
of
them
then
the
disciples
understood
that
he
spake
unto
them
of
john
the
baptist
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
multitude
there
came
to
him
a
certain
man
kneeling
down
to
him
and
saying
lord
have
mercy
on
my
son
for
he
is
lunatick
and
sore
vexed
for
ofttimes
he
falleth
into
the
fire
and
oft
into
the
water
and
i
brought
him
to
thy
disciples
and
they
could
not
cure
him
then
jesus
answered
and
said
o
faithless
and
perverse
generation
how
long
shall
i
be
with
you
how
long
shall
i
suffer
you
bring
him
hither
to
me
and
jesus
rebuked
the
devil
and
he
departed
out
of
him
and
the
child
was
cured
from
that
very
hour
then
came
the
disciples
to
jesus
apart
and
said
why
could
not
we
cast
him
out
and
jesus
said
unto
them
because
of
your
unbelief
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
ye
have
faith
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
ye
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
remove
hence
to
yonder
place
and
it
shall
remove
and
nothing
shall
be
impossible
unto
you
howbeit
this
kind
goeth
not
out
but
by
prayer
and
fasting
and
while
they
abode
in
galilee
jesus
said
unto
them
the
son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
men
and
they
shall
kill
him
and
the
third
day
he
shall
be
raised
again
and
they
were
exceeding
sorry
and
when
they
were
come
to
capernaum
they
that
received
tribute
money
came
to
peter
and
said
doth
not
your
master
pay
tribute
he
saith
yes
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
house
jesus
prevented
him
saying
what
thinkest
thou
simon
of
whom
do
the
kings
of
the
earth
take
custom
or
tribute
of
their
own
children
or
of
strangers
peter
saith
unto
him
of
strangers
jesus
saith
unto
him
then
are
the
children
free
notwithstanding
lest
we
should
offend
them
go
thou
to
the
sea
and
cast
an
hook
and
take
up
the
fish
that
first
cometh
up
and
when
thou
hast
opened
his
mouth
thou
shalt
find
a
piece
of
money
that
take
and
give
unto
them
for
me
and
thee
