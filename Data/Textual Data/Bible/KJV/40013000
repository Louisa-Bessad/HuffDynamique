the
same
day
went
jesus
out
of
the
house
and
sat
by
the
sea
side
and
great
multitudes
were
gathered
together
unto
him
so
that
he
went
into
a
ship
and
sat
and
the
whole
multitude
stood
on
the
shore
and
he
spake
many
things
unto
them
in
parables
saying
behold
a
sower
went
forth
to
sow
and
when
he
sowed
some
seeds
fell
by
the
way
side
and
the
fowls
came
and
devoured
them
up
some
fell
upon
stony
places
where
they
had
not
much
earth
and
forthwith
they
sprung
up
because
they
had
no
deepness
of
earth
and
when
the
sun
was
up
they
were
scorched
and
because
they
had
no
root
they
withered
away
and
some
fell
among
thorns
and
the
thorns
sprung
up
and
choked
them
but
other
fell
into
good
ground
and
brought
forth
fruit
some
an
hundredfold
some
sixtyfold
some
thirtyfold
who
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
and
the
disciples
came
and
said
unto
him
why
speakest
thou
unto
them
in
parables
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
because
it
is
given
unto
you
to
know
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
to
them
it
is
not
given
for
whosoever
hath
to
him
shall
be
given
and
he
shall
have
more
abundance
but
whosoever
hath
not
from
him
shall
be
taken
away
even
that
he
hath
therefore
speak
i
to
them
in
parables
because
they
seeing
see
not
and
hearing
they
hear
not
neither
do
they
understand
and
in
them
is
fulfilled
the
prophecy
of
esaias
which
saith
by
hearing
ye
shall
hear
and
shall
not
understand
and
seeing
ye
shall
see
and
shall
not
perceive
for
this
peoples
heart
is
waxed
gross
and
their
ears
are
dull
of
hearing
and
their
eyes
they
have
closed
lest
at
any
time
they
should
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
should
understand
with
their
heart
and
should
be
converted
and
i
should
heal
them
but
blessed
are
your
eyes
for
they
see
and
your
ears
for
they
hear
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
many
prophets
and
righteous
men
have
desired
to
see
those
things
which
ye
see
and
have
not
seen
them
and
to
hear
those
things
which
ye
hear
and
have
not
heard
them
hear
ye
therefore
the
parable
of
the
sower
when
any
one
heareth
the
word
of
the
kingdom
and
understandeth
it
not
then
cometh
the
wicked
one
and
catcheth
away
that
which
was
sown
in
his
heart
this
is
he
which
received
seed
by
the
way
side
but
he
that
received
the
seed
into
stony
places
the
same
is
he
that
heareth
the
word
and
anon
with
joy
receiveth
it
yet
hath
he
not
root
in
himself
but
dureth
for
a
while
for
when
tribulation
or
persecution
ariseth
because
of
the
word
by
and
by
he
is
offended
he
also
that
received
seed
among
the
thorns
is
he
that
heareth
the
word
and
the
care
of
this
world
and
the
deceitfulness
of
riches
choke
the
word
and
he
becometh
unfruitful
but
he
that
received
seed
into
the
good
ground
is
he
that
heareth
the
word
and
understandeth
it
which
also
beareth
fruit
and
bringeth
forth
some
an
hundredfold
some
sixty
some
thirty
another
parable
put
he
forth
unto
them
saying
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
likened
unto
a
man
which
sowed
good
seed
in
his
field
but
while
men
slept
his
enemy
came
and
sowed
tares
among
the
wheat
and
went
his
way
but
when
the
blade
was
sprung
up
and
brought
forth
fruit
then
appeared
the
tares
also
so
the
servants
of
the
householder
came
and
said
unto
him
sir
didst
not
thou
sow
good
seed
in
thy
field
from
whence
then
hath
it
tares
he
said
unto
them
an
enemy
hath
done
this
the
servants
said
unto
him
wilt
thou
then
that
we
go
and
gather
them
up
but
he
said
nay
lest
while
ye
gather
up
the
tares
ye
root
up
also
the
wheat
with
them
let
both
grow
together
until
the
harvest
and
in
the
time
of
harvest
i
will
say
to
the
reapers
gather
ye
together
first
the
tares
and
bind
them
in
bundles
to
burn
them
but
gather
the
wheat
into
my
barn
another
parable
put
he
forth
unto
them
saying
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
to
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
which
a
man
took
and
sowed
in
his
field
which
indeed
is
the
least
of
all
seeds
but
when
it
is
grown
it
is
the
greatest
among
herbs
and
becometh
a
tree
so
that
the
birds
of
the
air
come
and
lodge
in
the
branches
thereof
another
parable
spake
he
unto
them
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
leaven
which
a
woman
took
and
hid
in
three
measures
of
meal
till
the
whole
was
leavened
all
these
things
spake
jesus
unto
the
multitude
in
parables
and
without
a
parable
spake
he
not
unto
them
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
saying
i
will
open
my
mouth
in
parables
i
will
utter
things
which
have
been
kept
secret
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
then
jesus
sent
the
multitude
away
and
went
into
the
house
and
his
disciples
came
unto
him
saying
declare
unto
us
the
parable
of
the
tares
of
the
field
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
he
that
soweth
the
good
seed
is
the
son
of
man
the
field
is
the
world
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
but
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
the
enemy
that
sowed
them
is
the
devil
the
harvest
is
the
end
of
the
world
and
the
reapers
are
the
angels
as
therefore
the
tares
are
gathered
and
burned
in
the
fire
so
shall
it
be
in
the
end
of
this
world
the
son
of
man
shall
send
forth
his
angels
and
they
shall
gather
out
of
his
kingdom
all
things
that
offend
and
them
which
do
iniquity
and
shall
cast
them
into
a
furnace
of
fire
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
then
shall
the
righteous
shine
forth
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of
their
father
who
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
again
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
treasure
hid
in
a
field
the
which
when
a
man
hath
found
he
hideth
and
for
joy
thereof
goeth
and
selleth
all
that
he
hath
and
buyeth
that
field
again
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
merchant
man
seeking
goodly
pearls
who
when
he
had
found
one
pearl
of
great
price
went
and
sold
all
that
he
had
and
bought
it
again
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
net
that
was
cast
into
the
sea
and
gathered
of
every
kind
which
when
it
was
full
they
drew
to
shore
and
sat
down
and
gathered
the
good
into
vessels
but
cast
the
bad
away
so
shall
it
be
at
the
end
of
the
world
the
angels
shall
come
forth
and
sever
the
wicked
from
among
the
just
and
shall
cast
them
into
the
furnace
of
fire
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
jesus
saith
unto
them
have
ye
understood
all
these
things
they
say
unto
him
yea
lord
then
said
he
unto
them
therefore
every
scribe
which
is
instructed
unto
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
man
that
is
an
householder
which
bringeth
forth
out
of
his
treasure
things
new
and
old
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
finished
these
parables
he
departed
thence
and
when
he
was
come
into
his
own
country
he
taught
them
in
their
synagogue
insomuch
that
they
were
astonished
and
said
whence
hath
this
man
this
wisdom
and
these
mighty
works
is
not
this
the
carpenters
son
is
not
his
mother
called
mary
and
his
brethren
james
and
joses
and
simon
and
judas
and
his
sisters
are
they
not
all
with
us
whence
then
hath
this
man
all
these
things
and
they
were
offended
in
him
but
jesus
said
unto
them
a
prophet
is
not
without
honour
save
in
his
own
country
and
in
his
own
house
and
he
did
not
many
mighty
works
there
because
of
their
unbelief
