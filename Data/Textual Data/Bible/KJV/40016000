the
pharisees
also
with
the
sadducees
came
and
tempting
desired
him
that
he
would
shew
them
a
sign
from
heaven
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
when
it
is
evening
ye
say
it
will
be
fair
weather
for
the
sky
is
red
and
in
the
morning
it
will
be
foul
weather
to
day
for
the
sky
is
red
and
lowring
o
ye
hypocrites
ye
can
discern
the
face
of
the
sky
but
can
ye
not
discern
the
signs
of
the
times
a
wicked
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
a
sign
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
unto
it
but
the
sign
of
the
prophet
jonas
and
he
left
them
and
departed
and
when
his
disciples
were
come
to
the
other
side
they
had
forgotten
to
take
bread
then
jesus
said
unto
them
take
heed
and
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
sadducees
and
they
reasoned
among
themselves
saying
it
is
because
we
have
taken
no
bread
which
when
jesus
perceived
he
said
unto
them
o
ye
of
little
faith
why
reason
ye
among
yourselves
because
ye
have
brought
no
bread
do
ye
not
yet
understand
neither
remember
the
five
loaves
of
the
five
thousand
and
how
many
baskets
ye
took
up
neither
the
seven
loaves
of
the
four
thousand
and
how
many
baskets
ye
took
up
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
understand
that
i
spake
it
not
to
you
concerning
bread
that
ye
should
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
sadducees
then
understood
they
how
that
he
bade
them
not
beware
of
the
leaven
of
bread
but
of
the
doctrine
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
sadducees
when
jesus
came
into
the
coasts
of
caesarea
philippi
he
asked
his
disciples
saying
whom
do
men
say
that
i
the
son
of
man
am
and
they
said
some
say
that
thou
art
john
the
baptist
some
elias
and
others
jeremias
or
one
of
the
prophets
he
saith
unto
them
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
and
simon
peter
answered
and
said
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
blessed
art
thou
simon
barjona
for
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
it
unto
thee
but
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
and
i
say
also
unto
thee
that
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
and
i
will
give
unto
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven
then
charged
he
his
disciples
that
they
should
tell
no
man
that
he
was
jesus
the
christ
from
that
time
forth
began
jesus
to
shew
unto
his
disciples
how
that
he
must
go
unto
jerusalem
and
suffer
many
things
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
be
killed
and
be
raised
again
the
third
day
then
peter
took
him
and
began
to
rebuke
him
saying
be
it
far
from
thee
lord
this
shall
not
be
unto
thee
but
he
turned
and
said
unto
peter
get
thee
behind
me
satan
thou
art
an
offence
unto
me
for
thou
savourest
not
the
things
that
be
of
god
but
those
that
be
of
men
then
said
jesus
unto
his
disciples
if
any
man
will
come
after
me
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
up
his
cross
and
follow
me
for
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
it
and
whosoever
will
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
it
for
what
is
a
man
profited
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
soul
for
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
the
glory
of
his
father
with
his
angels
and
then
he
shall
reward
every
man
according
to
his
works
verily
i
say
unto
you
there
be
some
standing
here
which
shall
not
taste
of
death
till
they
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
his
kingdom
