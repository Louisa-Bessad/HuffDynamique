now
when
jesus
was
born
in
bethlehem
of
judaea
in
the
days
of
herod
the
king
behold
there
came
wise
men
from
the
east
to
jerusalem
saying
where
is
he
that
is
born
king
of
the
jews
for
we
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east
and
are
come
to
worship
him
when
herod
the
king
had
heard
these
things
he
was
troubled
and
all
jerusalem
with
him
and
when
he
had
gathered
all
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
of
the
people
together
he
demanded
of
them
where
christ
should
be
born
and
they
said
unto
him
in
bethlehem
of
judaea
for
thus
it
is
written
by
the
prophet
and
thou
bethlehem
in
the
land
of
juda
art
not
the
least
among
the
princes
of
juda
for
out
of
thee
shall
come
a
governor
that
shall
rule
my
people
israel
then
herod
when
he
had
privily
called
the
wise
men
enquired
of
them
diligently
what
time
the
star
appeared
and
he
sent
them
to
bethlehem
and
said
go
and
search
diligently
for
the
young
child
and
when
ye
have
found
him
bring
me
word
again
that
i
may
come
and
worship
him
also
when
they
had
heard
the
king
they
departed
and
lo
the
star
which
they
saw
in
the
east
went
before
them
till
it
came
and
stood
over
where
the
young
child
was
when
they
saw
the
star
they
rejoiced
with
exceeding
great
joy
and
when
they
were
come
into
the
house
they
saw
the
young
child
with
mary
his
mother
and
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
and
when
they
had
opened
their
treasures
they
presented
unto
him
gifts
gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
and
being
warned
of
god
in
a
dream
that
they
should
not
return
to
herod
they
departed
into
their
own
country
another
way
and
when
they
were
departed
behold
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeareth
to
joseph
in
a
dream
saying
arise
and
take
the
young
child
and
his
mother
and
flee
into
egypt
and
be
thou
there
until
i
bring
thee
word
for
herod
will
seek
the
young
child
to
destroy
him
when
he
arose
he
took
the
young
child
and
his
mother
by
night
and
departed
into
egypt
and
was
there
until
the
death
of
herod
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
of
the
lord
by
the
prophet
saying
out
of
egypt
have
i
called
my
son
then
herod
when
he
saw
that
he
was
mocked
of
the
wise
men
was
exceeding
wroth
and
sent
forth
and
slew
all
the
children
that
were
in
bethlehem
and
in
all
the
coasts
thereof
from
two
years
old
and
under
according
to
the
time
which
he
had
diligently
enquired
of
the
wise
men
then
was
fulfilled
that
which
was
spoken
by
jeremy
the
prophet
saying
in
rama
was
there
a
voice
heard
lamentation
and
weeping
and
great
mourning
rachel
weeping
for
her
children
and
would
not
be
comforted
because
they
are
not
but
when
herod
was
dead
behold
an
angel
of
the
lord
appeareth
in
a
dream
to
joseph
in
egypt
saying
arise
and
take
the
young
child
and
his
mother
and
go
into
the
land
of
israel
for
they
are
dead
which
sought
the
young
childs
life
and
he
arose
and
took
the
young
child
and
his
mother
and
came
into
the
land
of
israel
but
when
he
heard
that
archelaus
did
reign
in
judaea
in
the
room
of
his
father
herod
he
was
afraid
to
go
thither
notwithstanding
being
warned
of
god
in
a
dream
he
turned
aside
into
the
parts
of
galilee
and
he
came
and
dwelt
in
a
city
called
nazareth
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophets
he
shall
be
called
a
nazarene
