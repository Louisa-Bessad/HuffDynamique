at
that
time
herod
the
tetrarch
heard
of
the
fame
of
jesus
and
said
unto
his
servants
this
is
john
the
baptist
he
is
risen
from
the
dead
and
therefore
mighty
works
do
shew
forth
themselves
in
him
for
herod
had
laid
hold
on
john
and
bound
him
and
put
him
in
prison
for
herodias
sake
his
brother
philips
wife
for
john
said
unto
him
it
is
not
lawful
for
thee
to
have
her
and
when
he
would
have
put
him
to
death
he
feared
the
multitude
because
they
counted
him
as
a
prophet
but
when
herods
birthday
was
kept
the
daughter
of
herodias
danced
before
them
and
pleased
herod
whereupon
he
promised
with
an
oath
to
give
her
whatsoever
she
would
ask
and
she
being
before
instructed
of
her
mother
said
give
me
here
john
baptists
head
in
a
charger
and
the
king
was
sorry
nevertheless
for
the
oaths
sake
and
them
which
sat
with
him
at
meat
he
commanded
it
to
be
given
her
and
he
sent
and
beheaded
john
in
the
prison
and
his
head
was
brought
in
a
charger
and
given
to
the
damsel
and
she
brought
it
to
her
mother
and
his
disciples
came
and
took
up
the
body
and
buried
it
and
went
and
told
jesus
when
jesus
heard
of
it
he
departed
thence
by
ship
into
a
desert
place
apart
and
when
the
people
had
heard
thereof
they
followed
him
on
foot
out
of
the
cities
and
jesus
went
forth
and
saw
a
great
multitude
and
was
moved
with
compassion
toward
them
and
he
healed
their
sick
and
when
it
was
evening
his
disciples
came
to
him
saying
this
is
a
desert
place
and
the
time
is
now
past
send
the
multitude
away
that
they
may
go
into
the
villages
and
buy
themselves
victuals
but
jesus
said
unto
them
they
need
not
depart
give
ye
them
to
eat
and
they
say
unto
him
we
have
here
but
five
loaves
and
two
fishes
he
said
bring
them
hither
to
me
and
he
commanded
the
multitude
to
sit
down
on
the
grass
and
took
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fishes
and
looking
up
to
heaven
he
blessed
and
brake
and
gave
the
loaves
to
his
disciples
and
the
disciples
to
the
multitude
and
they
did
all
eat
and
were
filled
and
they
took
up
of
the
fragments
that
remained
twelve
baskets
full
and
they
that
had
eaten
were
about
five
thousand
men
beside
women
and
children
and
straightway
jesus
constrained
his
disciples
to
get
into
a
ship
and
to
go
before
him
unto
the
other
side
while
he
sent
the
multitudes
away
and
when
he
had
sent
the
multitudes
away
he
went
up
into
a
mountain
apart
to
pray
and
when
the
evening
was
come
he
was
there
alone
but
the
ship
was
now
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
tossed
with
waves
for
the
wind
was
contrary
and
in
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
jesus
went
unto
them
walking
on
the
sea
and
when
the
disciples
saw
him
walking
on
the
sea
they
were
troubled
saying
it
is
a
spirit
and
they
cried
out
for
fear
but
straightway
jesus
spake
unto
them
saying
be
of
good
cheer
it
is
i
be
not
afraid
and
peter
answered
him
and
said
lord
if
it
be
thou
bid
me
come
unto
thee
on
the
water
and
he
said
come
and
when
peter
was
come
down
out
of
the
ship
he
walked
on
the
water
to
go
to
jesus
but
when
he
saw
the
wind
boisterous
he
was
afraid
and
beginning
to
sink
he
cried
saying
lord
save
me
and
immediately
jesus
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
caught
him
and
said
unto
him
o
thou
of
little
faith
wherefore
didst
thou
doubt
and
when
they
were
come
into
the
ship
the
wind
ceased
then
they
that
were
in
the
ship
came
and
worshipped
him
saying
of
a
truth
thou
art
the
son
of
god
and
when
they
were
gone
over
they
came
into
the
land
of
gennesaret
and
when
the
men
of
that
place
had
knowledge
of
him
they
sent
out
into
all
that
country
round
about
and
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
diseased
and
besought
him
that
they
might
only
touch
the
hem
of
his
garment
and
as
many
as
touched
were
made
perfectly
whole
