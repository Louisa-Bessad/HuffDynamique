and
jesus
answered
and
spake
unto
them
again
by
parables
and
said
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
certain
king
which
made
a
marriage
for
his
son
and
sent
forth
his
servants
to
call
them
that
were
bidden
to
the
wedding
and
they
would
not
come
again
he
sent
forth
other
servants
saying
tell
them
which
are
bidden
behold
i
have
prepared
my
dinner
my
oxen
and
my
fatlings
are
killed
and
all
things
are
ready
come
unto
the
marriage
but
they
made
light
of
it
and
went
their
ways
one
to
his
farm
another
to
his
merchandise
and
the
remnant
took
his
servants
and
entreated
them
spitefully
and
slew
them
but
when
the
king
heard
thereof
he
was
wroth
and
he
sent
forth
his
armies
and
destroyed
those
murderers
and
burned
up
their
city
then
saith
he
to
his
servants
the
wedding
is
ready
but
they
which
were
bidden
were
not
worthy
go
ye
therefore
into
the
highways
and
as
many
as
ye
shall
find
bid
to
the
marriage
so
those
servants
went
out
into
the
highways
and
gathered
together
all
as
many
as
they
found
both
bad
and
good
and
the
wedding
was
furnished
with
guests
and
when
the
king
came
in
to
see
the
guests
he
saw
there
a
man
which
had
not
on
a
wedding
garment
and
he
saith
unto
him
friend
how
camest
thou
in
hither
not
having
a
wedding
garment
and
he
was
speechless
then
said
the
king
to
the
servants
bind
him
hand
and
foot
and
take
him
away
and
cast
him
into
outer
darkness
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
for
many
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
then
went
the
pharisees
and
took
counsel
how
they
might
entangle
him
in
his
talk
and
they
sent
out
unto
him
their
disciples
with
the
herodians
saying
master
we
know
that
thou
art
true
and
teachest
the
way
of
god
in
truth
neither
carest
thou
for
any
man
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
of
men
tell
us
therefore
what
thinkest
thou
is
it
lawful
to
give
tribute
unto
caesar
or
not
but
jesus
perceived
their
wickedness
and
said
why
tempt
ye
me
ye
hypocrites
shew
me
the
tribute
money
and
they
brought
unto
him
a
penny
and
he
saith
unto
them
whose
is
this
image
and
superscription
they
say
unto
him
caesars
then
saith
he
unto
them
render
therefore
unto
caesar
the
things
which
are
caesars
and
unto
god
the
things
that
are
gods
when
they
had
heard
these
words
they
marvelled
and
left
him
and
went
their
way
the
same
day
came
to
him
the
sadducees
which
say
that
there
is
no
resurrection
and
asked
him
saying
master
moses
said
if
a
man
die
having
no
children
his
brother
shall
marry
his
wife
and
raise
up
seed
unto
his
brother
now
there
were
with
us
seven
brethren
and
the
first
when
he
had
married
a
wife
deceased
and
having
no
issue
left
his
wife
unto
his
brother
likewise
the
second
also
and
the
third
unto
the
seventh
and
last
of
all
the
woman
died
also
therefore
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
shall
she
be
of
the
seven
for
they
all
had
her
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
ye
do
err
not
knowing
the
scriptures
nor
the
power
of
god
for
in
the
resurrection
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
as
the
angels
of
god
in
heaven
but
as
touching
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
have
ye
not
read
that
which
was
spoken
unto
you
by
god
saying
i
am
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
god
is
not
the
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
and
when
the
multitude
heard
this
they
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine
but
when
the
pharisees
had
heard
that
he
had
put
the
sadducees
to
silence
they
were
gathered
together
then
one
of
them
which
was
a
lawyer
asked
him
a
question
tempting
him
and
saying
master
which
is
the
great
commandment
in
the
law
jesus
said
unto
him
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
mind
this
is
the
first
and
great
commandment
and
the
second
is
like
unto
it
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
on
these
two
commandments
hang
all
the
law
and
the
prophets
while
the
pharisees
were
gathered
together
jesus
asked
them
saying
what
think
ye
of
christ
whose
son
is
he
they
say
unto
him
the
son
of
david
he
saith
unto
them
how
then
doth
david
in
spirit
call
him
lord
saying
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
till
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
if
david
then
call
him
lord
how
is
he
his
son
and
no
man
was
able
to
answer
him
a
word
neither
durst
any
man
from
that
day
forth
ask
him
any
more
questions
