and
when
he
had
called
unto
him
his
twelve
disciples
he
gave
them
power
against
unclean
spirits
to
cast
them
out
and
to
heal
all
manner
of
sickness
and
all
manner
of
disease
now
the
names
of
the
twelve
apostles
are
these
the
first

is
called
peter
and
andrew

judas
iscariot
who
also
betrayed
him
these
twelve
jesus
sent
forth
and
commanded
them
saying
go
not
into
the
way
of
the
gentiles
and
into
any
city
of
the
samaritans
enter
ye
not
but
go
rather
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
and
as
ye
go
preach
saying
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
heal
the
sick
cleanse
the
lepers
raise
the
dead
cast
out
devils
freely
ye
have
received
freely
give
provide
neither
gold
nor
silver
nor
brass
in
your
purses
nor
scrip
for
your
journey
neither
two
coats
neither
shoes
nor
yet
staves
for
the
workman
is
worthy
of
his
meat
and
into
whatsoever
city
or
town
ye
shall
enter
enquire
who
in
it
is
worthy
and
there
abide
till
ye
go
thence
and
when
ye
come
into
an
house
salute
it
and
if
the
house
be
worthy
let
your
peace
come
upon
it
but
if
it
be
not
worthy
let
your
peace
return
to
you
and
whosoever
shall
not
receive
you
nor
hear
your
words
when
ye
depart
out
of
that
house
or
city
shake
off
the
dust
of
your
feet
verily
i
say
unto
you
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
sodom
and
gomorrha
in
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
that
city
behold
i
send
you
forth
as
sheep
in
the
midst
of
wolves
be
ye
therefore
wise
as
serpents
and
harmless
as
doves
but
beware
of
men
for
they
will
deliver
you
up
to
the
councils
and
they
will
scourge
you
in
their
synagogues
and
ye
shall
be
brought
before
governors
and
kings
for
my
sake
for
a
testimony
against
them
and
the
gentiles
but
when
they
deliver
you
up
take
no
thought
how
or
what
ye
shall
speak
for
it
shall
be
given
you
in
that
same
hour
what
ye
shall
speak
for
it
is
not
ye
that
speak
but
the
spirit
of
your
father
which
speaketh
in
you
and
the
brother
shall
deliver
up
the
brother
to
death
and
the
father
the
child
and
the
children
shall
rise
up
against
their
parents
and
cause
them
to
be
put
to
death
and
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
names
sake
but
he
that
endureth
to
the
end
shall
be
saved
but
when
they
persecute
you
in
this
city
flee
ye
into
another
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
ye
shall
not
have
gone
over
the
cities
of
israel
till
the
son
of
man
be
come
the
disciple
is
not
above
his
master
nor
the
servant
above
his
lord
it
is
enough
for
the
disciple
that
he
be
as
his
master
and
the
servant
as
his
lord
if
they
have
called
the
master
of
the
house
beelzebub
how
much
more
shall
they
call
them
of
his
household
fear
them
not
therefore
for
there
is
nothing
covered
that
shall
not
be
revealed
and
hid
that
shall
not
be
known
what
i
tell
you
in
darkness
that
speak
ye
in
light
and
what
ye
hear
in
the
ear
that
preach
ye
upon
the
housetops
and
fear
not
them
which
kill
the
body
but
are
not
able
to
kill
the
soul
but
rather
fear
him
which
is
able
to
destroy
both
soul
and
body
in
hell
are
not
two
sparrows
sold
for
a
farthing
and
one
of
them
shall
not
fall
on
the
ground
without
your
father
but
the
very
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
numbered
fear
ye
not
therefore
ye
are
of
more
value
than
many
sparrows
whosoever
therefore
shall
confess
me
before
men
him
will
i
confess
also
before
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
but
whosoever
shall
deny
me
before
men
him
will
i
also
deny
before
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
think
not
that
i
am
come
to
send
peace
on
earth
i
came
not
to
send
peace
but
a
sword
for
i
am
come
to
set
a
man
at
variance
against
his
father
and
the
daughter
against
her
mother
and
the
daughter
in
law
against
her
mother
in
law
and
a
mans
foes
shall
be
they
of
his
own
household
he
that
loveth
father
or
mother
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
and
he
that
loveth
son
or
daughter
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
and
he
that
taketh
not
his
cross
and
followeth
after
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
he
that
findeth
his
life
shall
lose
it
and
he
that
loseth
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
it
he
that
receiveth
you
receiveth
me
and
he
that
receiveth
me
receiveth
him
that
sent
me
he
that
receiveth
a
prophet
in
the
name
of
a
prophet
shall
receive
a
prophets
reward
and
he
that
receiveth
a
righteous
man
in
the
name
of
a
righteous
man
shall
receive
a
righteous
mans
reward
and
whosoever
shall
give
to
drink
unto
one
of
these
little
ones
a
cup
of
cold
water
only
in
the
name
of
a
disciple
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
shall
in
no
wise
lose
his
reward
