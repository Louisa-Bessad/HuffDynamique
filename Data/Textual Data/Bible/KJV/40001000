joseph
the
husband
of
mary
of
whom
was
born
jesus
who
is
called
christ
so
all
the
generations
from
abraham
to
david
are
fourteen
generations
and
from
david
until
the
carrying
away
into
babylon
are
fourteen
generations
and
from
the
carrying
away
into
babylon
unto
christ
are
fourteen
generations
now
the
birth
of
jesus
christ
was
on
this
wise
when
as
his
mother
mary
was
espoused
to
joseph
before
they
came
together
she
was
found
with
child
of
the
holy
ghost
then
joseph
her
husband
being
a
just
man
and
not
willing
to
make
her
a
publick
example
was
minded
to
put
her
away
privily
but
while
he
thought
on
these
things
behold
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
in
a
dream
saying
joseph
thou
son
of
david
fear
not
to
take
unto
thee
mary
thy
wife
for
that
which
is
conceived
in
her
is
of
the
holy
ghost
and
she
shall
bring
forth
a
son
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
jesus
for
he
shall
save
his
people
from
their
sins
now
all
this
was
done
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
of
the
lord
by
the
prophet
saying
behold
a
virgin
shall
be
with
child
and
shall
bring
forth
a
son
and
they
shall
call
his
name
emmanuel
which
being
interpreted
is
god
with
us
then
joseph
being
raised
from
sleep
did
as
the
angel
of
the
lord
had
bidden
him
and
took
unto
him
his
wife
and
knew
her
not
till
she
had
brought
forth
her
firstborn
son
and
he
called
his
name
jesus
