and
it
came
to
pass
when
jesus
had
made
an
end
of
commanding
his
twelve
disciples
he
departed
thence
to
teach
and
to
preach
in
their
cities
now
when
john
had
heard
in
the
prison
the
works
of
christ
he
sent
two
of
his
disciples
and
said
unto
him
art
thou
he
that
should
come
or
do
we
look
for
another
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
go
and
shew
john
again
those
things
which
ye
do
hear
and
see
the
blind
receive
their
sight
and
the
lame
walk
the
lepers
are
cleansed
and
the
deaf
hear
the
dead
are
raised
up
and
the
poor
have
the
gospel
preached
to
them
and
blessed
is
he
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
me
and
as
they
departed
jesus
began
to
say
unto
the
multitudes
concerning
john
what
went
ye
out
into
the
wilderness
to
see
a
reed
shaken
with
the
wind
but
what
went
ye
out
for
to
see
a
man
clothed
in
soft
raiment
behold
they
that
wear
soft
clothing
are
in
kings
houses
but
what
went
ye
out
for
to
see
a
prophet
yea
i
say
unto
you
and
more
than
a
prophet
for
this
is
he
of
whom
it
is
written
behold
i
send
my
messenger
before
thy
face
which
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
thee
verily
i
say
unto
you
among
them
that
are
born
of
women
there
hath
not
risen
a
greater
than
john
the
baptist
notwithstanding
he
that
is
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
greater
than
he
and
from
the
days
of
john
the
baptist
until
now
the
kingdom
of
heaven
suffereth
violence
and
the
violent
take
it
by
force
for
all
the
prophets
and
the
law
prophesied
until
john
and
if
ye
will
receive
it
this
is
elias
which
was
for
to
come
he
that
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
but
whereunto
shall
i
liken
this
generation
it
is
like
unto
children
sitting
in
the
markets
and
calling
unto
their
fellows
and
saying
we
have
piped
unto
you
and
ye
have
not
danced
we
have
mourned
unto
you
and
ye
have
not
lamented
for
john
came
neither
eating
nor
drinking
and
they
say
he
hath
a
devil
the
son
of
man
came
eating
and
drinking
and
they
say
behold
a
man
gluttonous
and
a
winebibber
a
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
but
wisdom
is
justified
of
her
children
then
began
he
to
upbraid
the
cities
wherein
most
of
his
mighty
works
were
done
because
they
repented
not
woe
unto
thee
chorazin
woe
unto
thee
bethsaida
for
if
the
mighty
works
which
were
done
in
you
had
been
done
in
tyre
and
sidon
they
would
have
repented
long
ago
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
but
i
say
unto
you
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
tyre
and
sidon
at
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
you
and
thou
capernaum
which
art
exalted
unto
heaven
shalt
be
brought
down
to
hell
for
if
the
mighty
works
which
have
been
done
in
thee
had
been
done
in
sodom
it
would
have
remained
until
this
day
but
i
say
unto
you
that
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
sodom
in
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
thee
at
that
time
jesus
answered
and
said
i
thank
thee
o
father
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
because
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
babes
even
so
father
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
sight
all
things
are
delivered
unto
me
of
my
father
and
no
man
knoweth
the
son
but
the
father
neither
knoweth
any
man
the
father
save
the
son
and
he
to
whomsoever
the
son
will
reveal
him
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
take
my
yoke
upon
you
and
learn
of
me
for
i
am
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
and
ye
shall
find
rest
unto
your
souls
for
my
yoke
is
easy
and
my
burden
is
light
