and
it
came
to
pass
when
jesus
had
finished
all
these
sayings
he
said
unto
his
disciples
ye
know
that
after
two
days
is
the
feast
of
the
passover
and
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
to
be
crucified
then
assembled
together
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
of
the
people
unto
the
palace
of
the
high
priest
who
was
called
caiaphas
and
consulted
that
they
might
take
jesus
by
subtilty
and
kill
him
but
they
said
not
on
the
feast
day
lest
there
be
an
uproar
among
the
people
now
when
jesus
was
in
bethany
in
the
house
of
simon
the
leper
there
came
unto
him
a
woman
having
an
alabaster
box
of
very
precious
ointment
and
poured
it
on
his
head
as
he
sat
at
meat
but
when
his
disciples
saw
it
they
had
indignation
saying
to
what
purpose
is
this
waste
for
this
ointment
might
have
been
sold
for
much
and
given
to
the
poor
when
jesus
understood
it
he
said
unto
them
why
trouble
ye
the
woman
for
she
hath
wrought
a
good
work
upon
me
for
ye
have
the
poor
always
with
you
but
me
ye
have
not
always
for
in
that
she
hath
poured
this
ointment
on
my
body
she
did
it
for
my
burial
verily
i
say
unto
you
wheresoever
this
gospel
shall
be
preached
in
the
whole
world
there
shall
also
this
that
this
woman
hath
done
be
told
for
a
memorial
of
her
then
one
of
the
twelve
called
judas
iscariot
went
unto
the
chief
priests
and
said
unto
them
what
will
ye
give
me
and
i
will
deliver
him
unto
you
and
they
covenanted
with
him
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
and
from
that
time
he
sought
opportunity
to
betray
him
now
the
first
day
of
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
the
disciples
came
to
jesus
saying
unto
him
where
wilt
thou
that
we
prepare
for
thee
to
eat
the
passover
and
he
said
go
into
the
city
to
such
a
man
and
say
unto
him
the
master
saith
my
time
is
at
hand
i
will
keep
the
passover
at
thy
house
with
my
disciples
and
the
disciples
did
as
jesus
had
appointed
them
and
they
made
ready
the
passover
now
when
the
even
was
come
he
sat
down
with
the
twelve
and
as
they
did
eat
he
said
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
one
of
you
shall
betray
me
and
they
were
exceeding
sorrowful
and
began
every
one
of
them
to
say
unto
him
lord
is
it
i
and
he
answered
and
said
he
that
dippeth
his
hand
with
me
in
the
dish
the
same
shall
betray
me
the
son
of
man
goeth
as
it
is
written
of
him
but
woe
unto
that
man
by
whom
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
it
had
been
good
for
that
man
if
he
had
not
been
born
then
judas
which
betrayed
him
answered
and
said
master
is
it
i
he
said
unto
him
thou
hast
said
and
as
they
were
eating
jesus
took
bread
and
blessed
it
and
brake
it
and
gave
it
to
the
disciples
and
said
take
eat
this
is
my
body
and
he
took
the
cup
and
gave
thanks
and
gave
it
to
them
saying
drink
ye
all
of
it
for
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
testament
which
is
shed
for
many
for
the
remission
of
sins
but
i
say
unto
you
i
will
not
drink
henceforth
of
this
fruit
of
the
vine
until
that
day
when
i
drink
it
new
with
you
in
my
fathers
kingdom
and
when
they
had
sung
an
hymn
they
went
out
into
the
mount
of
olives
then
saith
jesus
unto
them
all
ye
shall
be
offended
because
of
me
this
night
for
it
is
written
i
will
smite
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
of
the
flock
shall
be
scattered
abroad
but
after
i
am
risen
again
i
will
go
before
you
into
galilee
peter
answered
and
said
unto
him
though
all
men
shall
be
offended
because
of
thee
yet
will
i
never
be
offended
jesus
said
unto
him
verily
i
say
unto
thee
that
this
night
before
the
cock
crow
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice
peter
said
unto
him
though
i
should
die
with
thee
yet
will
i
not
deny
thee
likewise
also
said
all
the
disciples
then
cometh
jesus
with
them
unto
a
place
called
gethsemane
and
saith
unto
the
disciples
sit
ye
here
while
i
go
and
pray
yonder
and
he
took
with
him
peter
and
the
two
sons
of
zebedee
and
began
to
be
sorrowful
and
very
heavy
then
saith
he
unto
them
my
soul
is
exceeding
sorrowful
even
unto
death
tarry
ye
here
and
watch
with
me
and
he
went
a
little
farther
and
fell
on
his
face
and
prayed
saying
o
my
father
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
nevertheless
not
as
i
will
but
as
thou
wilt
and
he
cometh
unto
the
disciples
and
findeth
them
asleep
and
saith
unto
peter
what
could
ye
not
watch
with
me
one
hour
watch
and
pray
that
ye
enter
not
into
temptation
the
spirit
indeed
is
willing
but
the
flesh
is
weak
he
went
away
again
the
second
time
and
prayed
saying
o
my
father
if
this
cup
may
not
pass
away
from
me
except
i
drink
it
thy
will
be
done
and
he
came
and
found
them
asleep
again
for
their
eyes
were
heavy
and
he
left
them
and
went
away
again
and
prayed
the
third
time
saying
the
same
words
then
cometh
he
to
his
disciples
and
saith
unto
them
sleep
on
now
and
take
your
rest
behold
the
hour
is
at
hand
and
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
sinners
rise
let
us
be
going
behold
he
is
at
hand
that
doth
betray
me
and
while
he
yet
spake
lo
judas
one
of
the
twelve
came
and
with
him
a
great
multitude
with
swords
and
staves
from
the
chief
priests
and
elders
of
the
people
now
he
that
betrayed
him
gave
them
a
sign
saying
whomsoever
i
shall
kiss
that
same
is
he
hold
him
fast
and
forthwith
he
came
to
jesus
and
said
hail
master
and
kissed
him
and
jesus
said
unto
him
friend
wherefore
art
thou
come
then
came
they
and
laid
hands
on
jesus
and
took
him
and
behold
one
of
them
which
were
with
jesus
stretched
out
his
hand
and
drew
his
sword
and
struck
a
servant
of
the
high
priests
and
smote
off
his
ear
then
said
jesus
unto
him
put
up
again
thy
sword
into
his
place
for
all
they
that
take
the
sword
shall
perish
with
the
sword
thinkest
thou
that
i
cannot
now
pray
to
my
father
and
he
shall
presently
give
me
more
than
twelve
legions
of
angels
but
how
then
shall
the
scriptures
be
fulfilled
that
thus
it
must
be
in
that
same
hour
said
jesus
to
the
multitudes
are
ye
come
out
as
against
a
thief
with
swords
and
staves
for
to
take
me
i
sat
daily
with
you
teaching
in
the
temple
and
ye
laid
no
hold
on
me
but
all
this
was
done
that
the
scriptures
of
the
prophets
might
be
fulfilled
then
all
the
disciples
forsook
him
and
fled
and
they
that
had
laid
hold
on
jesus
led
him
away
to
caiaphas
the
high
priest
where
the
scribes
and
the
elders
were
assembled
but
peter
followed
him
afar
off
unto
the
high
priests
palace
and
went
in
and
sat
with
the
servants
to
see
the
end
now
the
chief
priests
and
elders
and
all
the
council
sought
false
witness
against
jesus
to
put
him
to
death
but
found
none
yea
though
many
false
witnesses
came
yet
found
they
none
at
the
last
came
two
false
witnesses
and
said
this
fellow
said
i
am
able
to
destroy
the
temple
of
god
and
to
build
it
in
three
days
and
the
high
priest
arose
and
said
unto
him
answerest
thou
nothing
what
is
it
which
these
witness
against
thee
but
jesus
held
his
peace
and
the
high
priest
answered
and
said
unto
him
i
adjure
thee
by
the
living
god
that
thou
tell
us
whether
thou
be
the
christ
the
son
of
god
jesus
saith
unto
him
thou
hast
said
nevertheless
i
say
unto
you
hereafter
shall
ye
see
the
son
of
man
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
power
and
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
then
the
high
priest
rent
his
clothes
saying
he
hath
spoken
blasphemy
what
further
need
have
we
of
witnesses
behold
now
ye
have
heard
his
blasphemy
what
think
ye
they
answered
and
said
he
is
guilty
of
death
then
did
they
spit
in
his
face
and
buffeted
him
and
others
smote
him
with
the
palms
of
their
hands
saying
prophesy
unto
us
thou
christ
who
is
he
that
smote
thee
now
peter
sat
without
in
the
palace
and
a
damsel
came
unto
him
saying
thou
also
wast
with
jesus
of
galilee
but
he
denied
before
them
all
saying
i
know
not
what
thou
sayest
and
when
he
was
gone
out
into
the
porch
another
maid
saw
him
and
said
unto
them
that
were
there
this
fellow
was
also
with
jesus
of
nazareth
and
again
he
denied
with
an
oath
i
do
not
know
the
man
and
after
a
while
came
unto
him
they
that
stood
by
and
said
to
peter
surely
thou
also
art
one
of
them
for
thy
speech
bewrayeth
thee
then
began
he
to
curse
and
to
swear
saying
i
know
not
the
man
and
immediately
the
cock
crew
and
peter
remembered
the
word
of
jesus
which
said
unto
him
before
the
cock
crow
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice
and
he
went
out
and
wept
bitterly
