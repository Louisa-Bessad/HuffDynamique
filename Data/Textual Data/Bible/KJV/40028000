in
the
end
of
the
sabbath
as
it
began
to
dawn
toward
the
first
day
of
the
week
came
mary
magdalene
and
the
other
mary
to
see
the
sepulchre
and
behold
there
was
a
great
earthquake
for
the
angel
of
the
lord
descended
from
heaven
and
came
and
rolled
back
the
stone
from
the
door
and
sat
upon
it
his
countenance
was
like
lightning
and
his
raiment
white
as
snow
and
for
fear
of
him
the
keepers
did
shake
and
became
as
dead
men
and
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
the
women
fear
not
ye
for
i
know
that
ye
seek
jesus
which
was
crucified
he
is
not
here
for
he
is
risen
as
he
said
come
see
the
place
where
the
lord
lay
and
go
quickly
and
tell
his
disciples
that
he
is
risen
from
the
dead
and
behold
he
goeth
before
you
into
galilee
there
shall
ye
see
him
lo
i
have
told
you
and
they
departed
quickly
from
the
sepulchre
with
fear
and
great
joy
and
did
run
to
bring
his
disciples
word
and
as
they
went
to
tell
his
disciples
behold
jesus
met
them
saying
all
hail
and
they
came
and
held
him
by
the
feet
and
worshipped
him
then
said
jesus
unto
them
be
not
afraid
go
tell
my
brethren
that
they
go
into
galilee
and
there
shall
they
see
me
now
when
they
were
going
behold
some
of
the
watch
came
into
the
city
and
shewed
unto
the
chief
priests
all
the
things
that
were
done
and
when
they
were
assembled
with
the
elders
and
had
taken
counsel
they
gave
large
money
unto
the
soldiers
saying
say
ye
his
disciples
came
by
night
and
stole
him
away
while
we
slept
and
if
this
come
to
the
governors
ears
we
will
persuade
him
and
secure
you
so
they
took
the
money
and
did
as
they
were
taught
and
this
saying
is
commonly
reported
among
the
jews
until
this
day
then
the
eleven
disciples
went
away
into
galilee
into
a
mountain
where
jesus
had
appointed
them
and
when
they
saw
him
they
worshipped
him
but
some
doubted
and
jesus
came
and
spake
unto
them
saying
all
power
is
given
unto
me
in
heaven
and
in
earth
go
ye
therefore
and
teach
all
nations
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
teaching
them
to
observe
all
things
whatsoever
i
have
commanded
you
and
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
amen
the
gospel
according
to
st
mark
