when
he
was
come
down
from
the
mountain
great
multitudes
followed
him
and
behold
there
came
a
leper
and
worshipped
him
saying
lord
if
thou
wilt
thou
canst
make
me
clean
and
jesus
put
forth
his
hand
and
touched
him
saying
i
will
be
thou
clean
and
immediately
his
leprosy
was
cleansed
and
jesus
saith
unto
him
see
thou
tell
no
man
but
go
thy
way
shew
thyself
to
the
priest
and
offer
the
gift
that
moses
commanded
for
a
testimony
unto
them
and
when
jesus
was
entered
into
capernaum
there
came
unto
him
a
centurion
beseeching
him
and
saying
lord
my
servant
lieth
at
home
sick
of
the
palsy
grievously
tormented
and
jesus
saith
unto
him
i
will
come
and
heal
him
the
centurion
answered
and
said
lord
i
am
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
come
under
my
roof
but
speak
the
word
only
and
my
servant
shall
be
healed
for
i
am
a
man
under
authority
having
soldiers
under
me
and
i
say
to
this
man
go
and
he
goeth
and
to
another
come
and
he
cometh
and
to
my
servant
do
this
and
he
doeth
it
when
jesus
heard
it
he
marvelled
and
said
to
them
that
followed
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
have
not
found
so
great
faith
no
not
in
israel
and
i
say
unto
you
that
many
shall
come
from
the
east
and
west
and
shall
sit
down
with
abraham
and
isaac
and
jacob
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
the
children
of
the
kingdom
shall
be
cast
out
into
outer
darkness
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
and
jesus
said
unto
the
centurion
go
thy
way
and
as
thou
hast
believed
so
be
it
done
unto
thee
and
his
servant
was
healed
in
the
selfsame
hour
and
when
jesus
was
come
into
peters
house
he
saw
his
wifes
mother
laid
and
sick
of
a
fever
and
he
touched
her
hand
and
the
fever
left
her
and
she
arose
and
ministered
unto
them
when
the
even
was
come
they
brought
unto
him
many
that
were
possessed
with
devils
and
he
cast
out
the
spirits
with
his
word
and
healed
all
that
were
sick
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
esaias
the
prophet
saying
himself
took
our
infirmities
and
bare
our
sicknesses
now
when
jesus
saw
great
multitudes
about
him
he
gave
commandment
to
depart
unto
the
other
side
and
a
certain
scribe
came
and
said
unto
him
master
i
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest
and
jesus
saith
unto
him
the
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
of
the
air
have
nests
but
the
son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
head
and
another
of
his
disciples
said
unto
him
lord
suffer
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
father
but
jesus
said
unto
him
follow
me
and
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
and
when
he
was
entered
into
a
ship
his
disciples
followed
him
and
behold
there
arose
a
great
tempest
in
the
sea
insomuch
that
the
ship
was
covered
with
the
waves
but
he
was
asleep
and
his
disciples
came
to
him
and
awoke
him
saying
lord
save
us
we
perish
and
he
saith
unto
them
why
are
ye
fearful
o
ye
of
little
faith
then
he
arose
and
rebuked
the
winds
and
the
sea
and
there
was
a
great
calm
but
the
men
marvelled
saying
what
manner
of
man
is
this
that
even
the
winds
and
the
sea
obey
him
and
when
he
was
come
to
the
other
side
into
the
country
of
the
gergesenes
there
met
him
two
possessed
with
devils
coming
out
of
the
tombs
exceeding
fierce
so
that
no
man
might
pass
by
that
way
and
behold
they
cried
out
saying
what
have
we
to
do
with
thee
jesus
thou
son
of
god
art
thou
come
hither
to
torment
us
before
the
time
and
there
was
a
good
way
off
from
them
an
herd
of
many
swine
feeding
so
the
devils
besought
him
saying
if
thou
cast
us
out
suffer
us
to
go
away
into
the
herd
of
swine
and
he
said
unto
them
go
and
when
they
were
come
out
they
went
into
the
herd
of
swine
and
behold
the
whole
herd
of
swine
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
sea
and
perished
in
the
waters
and
they
that
kept
them
fled
and
went
their
ways
into
the
city
and
told
every
thing
and
what
was
befallen
to
the
possessed
of
the
devils
and
behold
the
whole
city
came
out
to
meet
jesus
and
when
they
saw
him
they
besought
him
that
he
would
depart
out
of
their
coasts
