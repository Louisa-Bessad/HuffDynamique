in
those
days
came
john
the
baptist
preaching
in
the
wilderness
of
judaea
and
saying
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
for
this
is
he
that
was
spoken
of
by
the
prophet
esaias
saying
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
his
paths
straight
and
the
same
john
had
his
raiment
of
camels
hair
and
a
leathern
girdle
about
his
loins
and
his
meat
was
locusts
and
wild
honey
then
went
out
to
him
jerusalem
and
all
judaea
and
all
the
region
round
about
jordan
and
were
baptized
of
him
in
jordan
confessing
their
sins
but
when
he
saw
many
of
the
pharisees
and
sadducees
come
to
his
baptism
he
said
unto
them
o
generation
of
vipers
who
hath
warned
you
to
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come
bring
forth
therefore
fruits
meet
for
repentance
and
think
not
to
say
within
yourselves
we
have
abraham
to
our
father
for
i
say
unto
you
that
god
is
able
of
these
stones
to
raise
up
children
unto
abraham
and
now
also
the
axe
is
laid
unto
the
root
of
the
trees
therefore
every
tree
which
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
i
indeed
baptize
you
with
water
unto
repentance
but
he
that
cometh
after
me
is
mightier
than
i
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
bear
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
fire
whose
fan
is
in
his
hand
and
he
will
throughly
purge
his
floor
and
gather
his
wheat
into
the
garner
but
he
will
burn
up
the
chaff
with
unquenchable
fire
then
cometh
jesus
from
galilee
to
jordan
unto
john
to
be
baptized
of
him
but
john
forbad
him
saying
i
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
thee
and
comest
thou
to
me
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
him
suffer
it
to
be
so
now
for
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfil
all
righteousness
then
he
suffered
him
and
jesus
when
he
was
baptized
went
up
straightway
out
of
the
water
and
lo
the
heavens
were
opened
unto
him
and
he
saw
the
spirit
of
god
descending
like
a
dove
and
lighting
upon
him
and
lo
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
