judge
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
for
with
what
judgment
ye
judge
ye
shall
be
judged
and
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
and
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
brothers
eye
but
considerest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
eye
or
how
wilt
thou
say
to
thy
brother
let
me
pull
out
the
mote
out
of
thine
eye
and
behold
a
beam
is
in
thine
own
eye
thou
hypocrite
first
cast
out
the
beam
out
of
thine
own
eye
and
then
shalt
thou
see
clearly
to
cast
out
the
mote
out
of
thy
brothers
eye
give
not
that
which
is
holy
unto
the
dogs
neither
cast
ye
your
pearls
before
swine
lest
they
trample
them
under
their
feet
and
turn
again
and
rend
you
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
you
seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
for
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
opened
or
what
man
is
there
of
you
whom
if
his
son
ask
bread
will
he
give
him
a
stone
or
if
he
ask
a
fish
will
he
give
him
a
serpent
if
ye
then
being
evil
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children
how
much
more
shall
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
give
good
things
to
them
that
ask
him
therefore
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
for
this
is
the
law
and
the
prophets
enter
ye
in
at
the
strait
gate
for
wide
is
the
gate
and
broad
is
the
way
that
leadeth
to
destruction
and
many
there
be
which
go
in
thereat
because
strait
is
the
gate
and
narrow
is
the
way
which
leadeth
unto
life
and
few
there
be
that
find
it
beware
of
false
prophets
which
come
to
you
in
sheeps
clothing
but
inwardly
they
are
ravening
wolves
ye
shall
know
them
by
their
fruits
do
men
gather
grapes
of
thorns
or
figs
of
thistles
even
so
every
good
tree
bringeth
forth
good
fruit
but
a
corrupt
tree
bringeth
forth
evil
fruit
a
good
tree
cannot
bring
forth
evil
fruit
neither
can
a
corrupt
tree
bring
forth
good
fruit
every
tree
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
wherefore
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
not
every
one
that
saith
unto
me
lord
lord
shall
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
many
will
say
to
me
in
that
day
lord
lord
have
we
not
prophesied
in
thy
name
and
in
thy
name
have
cast
out
devils
and
in
thy
name
done
many
wonderful
works
and
then
will
i
profess
unto
them
i
never
knew
you
depart
from
me
ye
that
work
iniquity
therefore
whosoever
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
i
will
liken
him
unto
a
wise
man
which
built
his
house
upon
a
rock
and
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
not
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
rock
and
every
one
that
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
not
shall
be
likened
unto
a
foolish
man
which
built
his
house
upon
the
sand
and
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
and
great
was
the
fall
of
it
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jesus
had
ended
these
sayings
the
people
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine
for
he
taught
them
as
one
having
authority
and
not
as
the
scribes
