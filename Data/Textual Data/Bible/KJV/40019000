and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
finished
these
sayings
he
departed
from
galilee
and
came
into
the
coasts
of
judaea
beyond
jordan
and
great
multitudes
followed
him
and
he
healed
them
there
the
pharisees
also
came
unto
him
tempting
him
and
saying
unto
him
is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
put
away
his
wife
for
every
cause
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
have
ye
not
read
that
he
which
made
them
at
the
beginning
made
them
male
and
female
and
said
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
father
and
mother
and
shall
cleave
to
his
wife
and
they
twain
shall
be
one
flesh
wherefore
they
are
no
more
twain
but
one
flesh
what
therefore
god
hath
joined
together
let
not
man
put
asunder
they
say
unto
him
why
did
moses
then
command
to
give
a
writing
of
divorcement
and
to
put
her
away
he
saith
unto
them
moses
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
suffered
you
to
put
away
your
wives
but
from
the
beginning
it
was
not
so
and
i
say
unto
you
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
except
it
be
for
fornication
and
shall
marry
another
committeth
adultery
and
whoso
marrieth
her
which
is
put
away
doth
commit
adultery
his
disciples
say
unto
him
if
the
case
of
the
man
be
so
with
his
wife
it
is
not
good
to
marry
but
he
said
unto
them
all
men
cannot
receive
this
saying
save
they
to
whom
it
is
given
for
there
are
some
eunuchs
which
were
so
born
from
their
mothers
womb
and
there
are
some
eunuchs
which
were
made
eunuchs
of
men
and
there
be
eunuchs
which
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heavens
sake
he
that
is
able
to
receive
it
let
him
receive
it
then
were
there
brought
unto
him
little
children
that
he
should
put
his
hands
on
them
and
pray
and
the
disciples
rebuked
them
but
jesus
said
suffer
little
children
and
forbid
them
not
to
come
unto
me
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
he
laid
his
hands
on
them
and
departed
thence
and
behold
one
came
and
said
unto
him
good
master
what
good
thing
shall
i
do
that
i
may
have
eternal
life
and
he
said
unto
him
why
callest
thou
me
good
there
is
none
good
but
one
that
is
god
but
if
thou
wilt
enter
into
life
keep
the
commandments
he
saith
unto
him
which
jesus
said
thou
shalt
do
no
murder
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
the
young
man
saith
unto
him
all
these
things
have
i
kept
from
my
youth
up
what
lack
i
yet
jesus
said
unto
him
if
thou
wilt
be
perfect
go
and
sell
that
thou
hast
and
give
to
the
poor
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
heaven
and
come
and
follow
me
but
when
the
young
man
heard
that
saying
he
went
away
sorrowful
for
he
had
great
possessions
then
said
jesus
unto
his
disciples
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
a
rich
man
shall
hardly
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
again
i
say
unto
you
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
when
his
disciples
heard
it
they
were
exceedingly
amazed
saying
who
then
can
be
saved
but
jesus
beheld
them
and
said
unto
them
with
men
this
is
impossible
but
with
god
all
things
are
possible
then
answered
peter
and
said
unto
him
behold
we
have
forsaken
all
and
followed
thee
what
shall
we
have
therefore
and
jesus
said
unto
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
which
have
followed
me
in
the
regeneration
when
the
son
of
man
shall
sit
in
the
throne
of
his
glory
ye
also
shall
sit
upon
twelve
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
and
every
one
that
hath
forsaken
houses
or
brethren
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
wife
or
children
or
lands
for
my
names
sake
shall
receive
an
hundredfold
and
shall
inherit
everlasting
life
but
many
that
are
first
shall
be
last
and
the
last
shall
be
first
