at
that
time
jesus
went
on
the
sabbath
day
through
the
corn
and
his
disciples
were
an
hungred
and
began
to
pluck
the
ears
of
corn
and
to
eat
but
when
the
pharisees
saw
it
they
said
unto
him
behold
thy
disciples
do
that
which
is
not
lawful
to
do
upon
the
sabbath
day
but
he
said
unto
them
have
ye
not
read
what
david
did
when
he
was
an
hungred
and
they
that
were
with
him
how
he
entered
into
the
house
of
god
and
did
eat
the
shewbread
which
was
not
lawful
for
him
to
eat
neither
for
them
which
were
with
him
but
only
for
the
priests
or
have
ye
not
read
in
the
law
how
that
on
the
sabbath
days
the
priests
in
the
temple
profane
the
sabbath
and
are
blameless
but
i
say
unto
you
that
in
this
place
is
one
greater
than
the
temple
but
if
ye
had
known
what
this
meaneth
i
will
have
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
ye
would
not
have
condemned
the
guiltless
for
the
son
of
man
is
lord
even
of
the
sabbath
day
and
when
he
was
departed
thence
he
went
into
their
synagogue
and
behold
there
was
a
man
which
had
his
hand
withered
and
they
asked
him
saying
is
it
lawful
to
heal
on
the
sabbath
days
that
they
might
accuse
him
and
he
said
unto
them
what
man
shall
there
be
among
you
that
shall
have
one
sheep
and
if
it
fall
into
a
pit
on
the
sabbath
day
will
he
not
lay
hold
on
it
and
lift
it
out
how
much
then
is
a
man
better
than
a
sheep
wherefore
it
is
lawful
to
do
well
on
the
sabbath
days
then
saith
he
to
the
man
stretch
forth
thine
hand
and
he
stretched
it
forth
and
it
was
restored
whole
like
as
the
other
then
the
pharisees
went
out
and
held
a
council
against
him
how
they
might
destroy
him
but
when
jesus
knew
it
he
withdrew
himself
from
thence
and
great
multitudes
followed
him
and
he
healed
them
all
and
charged
them
that
they
should
not
make
him
known
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
esaias
the
prophet
saying
behold
my
servant
whom
i
have
chosen
my
beloved
in
whom
my
soul
is
well
pleased
i
will
put
my
spirit
upon
him
and
he
shall
shew
judgment
to
the
gentiles
he
shall
not
strive
nor
cry
neither
shall
any
man
hear
his
voice
in
the
streets
a
bruised
reed
shall
he
not
break
and
smoking
flax
shall
he
not
quench
till
he
send
forth
judgment
unto
victory
and
in
his
name
shall
the
gentiles
trust
then
was
brought
unto
him
one
possessed
with
a
devil
blind
and
dumb
and
he
healed
him
insomuch
that
the
blind
and
dumb
both
spake
and
saw
and
all
the
people
were
amazed
and
said
is
not
this
the
son
of
david
but
when
the
pharisees
heard
it
they
said
this
fellow
doth
not
cast
out
devils
but
by
beelzebub
the
prince
of
the
devils
and
jesus
knew
their
thoughts
and
said
unto
them
every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
is
brought
to
desolation
and
every
city
or
house
divided
against
itself
shall
not
stand
and
if
satan
cast
out
satan
he
is
divided
against
himself
how
shall
then
his
kingdom
stand
and
if
i
by
beelzebub
cast
out
devils
by
whom
do
your
children
cast
them
out
therefore
they
shall
be
your
judges
but
if
i
cast
out
devils
by
the
spirit
of
god
then
the
kingdom
of
god
is
come
unto
you
or
else
how
can
one
enter
into
a
strong
mans
house
and
spoil
his
goods
except
he
first
bind
the
strong
man
and
then
he
will
spoil
his
house
he
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
me
and
he
that
gathereth
not
with
me
scattereth
abroad
wherefore
i
say
unto
you
all
manner
of
sin
and
blasphemy
shall
be
forgiven
unto
men
but
the
blasphemy
against
the
holy
ghost
shall
not
be
forgiven
unto
men
and
whosoever
speaketh
a
word
against
the
son
of
man
it
shall
be
forgiven
him
but
whosoever
speaketh
against
the
holy
ghost
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
him
neither
in
this
world
neither
in
the
world
to
come
either
make
the
tree
good
and
his
fruit
good
or
else
make
the
tree
corrupt
and
his
fruit
corrupt
for
the
tree
is
known
by
his
fruit
o
generation
of
vipers
how
can
ye
being
evil
speak
good
things
for
out
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
the
mouth
speaketh
a
good
man
out
of
the
good
treasure
of
the
heart
bringeth
forth
good
things
and
an
evil
man
out
of
the
evil
treasure
bringeth
forth
evil
things
but
i
say
unto
you
that
every
idle
word
that
men
shall
speak
they
shall
give
account
thereof
in
the
day
of
judgment
for
by
thy
words
thou
shalt
be
justified
and
by
thy
words
thou
shalt
be
condemned
then
certain
of
the
scribes
and
of
the
pharisees
answered
saying
master
we
would
see
a
sign
from
thee
but
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
an
evil
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
a
sign
and
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
to
it
but
the
sign
of
the
prophet
jonas
for
as
jonas
was
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
whales
belly
so
shall
the
son
of
man
be
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
heart
of
the
earth
the
men
of
nineveh
shall
rise
in
judgment
with
this
generation
and
shall
condemn
it
because
they
repented
at
the
preaching
of
jonas
and
behold
a
greater
than
jonas
is
here
the
queen
of
the
south
shall
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
this
generation
and
shall
condemn
it
for
she
came
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
solomon
and
behold
a
greater
than
solomon
is
here
when
the
unclean
spirit
is
gone
out
of
a
man
he
walketh
through
dry
places
seeking
rest
and
findeth
none
then
he
saith
i
will
return
into
my
house
from
whence
i
came
out
and
when
he
is
come
he
findeth
it
empty
swept
and
garnished
then
goeth
he
and
taketh
with
himself
seven
other
spirits
more
wicked
than
himself
and
they
enter
in
and
dwell
there
and
the
last
state
of
that
man
is
worse
than
the
first
even
so
shall
it
be
also
unto
this
wicked
generation
while
he
yet
talked
to
the
people
behold
his
mother
and
his
brethren
stood
without
desiring
to
speak
with
him
then
one
said
unto
him
behold
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
without
desiring
to
speak
with
thee
but
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
that
told
him
who
is
my
mother
and
who
are
my
brethren
and
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
his
disciples
and
said
behold
my
mother
and
my
brethren
for
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
the
same
is
my
brother
and
sister
and
mother
