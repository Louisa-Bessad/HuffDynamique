and
when
they
drew
nigh
unto
jerusalem
and
were
come
to
bethphage
unto
the
mount
of
olives
then
sent
jesus
two
disciples
saying
unto
them
go
into
the
village
over
against
you
and
straightway
ye
shall
find
an
ass
tied
and
a
colt
with
her
loose
them
and
bring
them
unto
me
and
if
any
man
say
ought
unto
you
ye
shall
say
the
lord
hath
need
of
them
and
straightway
he
will
send
them
all
this
was
done
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
saying
tell
ye
the
daughter
of
sion
behold
thy
king
cometh
unto
thee
meek
and
sitting
upon
an
ass
and
a
colt
the
foal
of
an
ass
and
the
disciples
went
and
did
as
jesus
commanded
them
and
brought
the
ass
and
the
colt
and
put
on
them
their
clothes
and
they
set
him
thereon
and
a
very
great
multitude
spread
their
garments
in
the
way
others
cut
down
branches
from
the
trees
and
strawed
them
in
the
way
and
the
multitudes
that
went
before
and
that
followed
cried
saying
hosanna
to
the
son
of
david
blessed
is
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
hosanna
in
the
highest
and
when
he
was
come
into
jerusalem
all
the
city
was
moved
saying
who
is
this
and
the
multitude
said
this
is
jesus
the
prophet
of
nazareth
of
galilee
and
jesus
went
into
the
temple
of
god
and
cast
out
all
them
that
sold
and
bought
in
the
temple
and
overthrew
the
tables
of
the
moneychangers
and
the
seats
of
them
that
sold
doves
and
said
unto
them
it
is
written
my
house
shall
be
called
the
house
of
prayer
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves
and
the
blind
and
the
lame
came
to
him
in
the
temple
and
he
healed
them
and
when
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
saw
the
wonderful
things
that
he
did
and
the
children
crying
in
the
temple
and
saying
hosanna
to
the
son
of
david
they
were
sore
displeased
and
said
unto
him
hearest
thou
what
these
say
and
jesus
saith
unto
them
yea
have
ye
never
read
out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
and
sucklings
thou
hast
perfected
praise
and
he
left
them
and
went
out
of
the
city
into
bethany
and
he
lodged
there
now
in
the
morning
as
he
returned
into
the
city
he
hungered
and
when
he
saw
a
fig
tree
in
the
way
he
came
to
it
and
found
nothing
thereon
but
leaves
only
and
said
unto
it
let
no
fruit
grow
on
thee
henceforward
for
ever
and
presently
the
fig
tree
withered
away
and
when
the
disciples
saw
it
they
marvelled
saying
how
soon
is
the
fig
tree
withered
away
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
ye
have
faith
and
doubt
not
ye
shall
not
only
do
this
which
is
done
to
the
fig
tree
but
also
if
ye
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
be
thou
removed
and
be
thou
cast
into
the
sea
it
shall
be
done
and
all
things
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
prayer
believing
ye
shall
receive
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
temple
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
people
came
unto
him
as
he
was
teaching
and
said
by
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things
and
who
gave
thee
this
authority
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
i
also
will
ask
you
one
thing
which
if
ye
tell
me
i
in
like
wise
will
tell
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
things
the
baptism
of
john
whence
was
it
from
heaven
or
of
men
and
they
reasoned
with
themselves
saying
if
we
shall
say
from
heaven
he
will
say
unto
us
why
did
ye
not
then
believe
him
but
if
we
shall
say
of
men
we
fear
the
people
for
all
hold
john
as
a
prophet
and
they
answered
jesus
and
said
we
cannot
tell
and
he
said
unto
them
neither
tell
i
you
by
what
authority
i
do
these
things
but
what
think
ye
a
certain
man
had
two
sons
and
he
came
to
the
first
and
said
son
go
work
to
day
in
my
vineyard
he
answered
and
said
i
will
not
but
afterward
he
repented
and
went
and
he
came
to
the
second
and
said
likewise
and
he
answered
and
said
i
go
sir
and
went
not
whether
of
them
twain
did
the
will
of
his
father
they
say
unto
him
the
first
jesus
saith
unto
them
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
go
into
the
kingdom
of
god
before
you
for
john
came
unto
you
in
the
way
of
righteousness
and
ye
believed
him
not
but
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
believed
him
and
ye
when
ye
had
seen
it
repented
not
afterward
that
ye
might
believe
him
hear
another
parable
there
was
a
certain
householder
which
planted
a
vineyard
and
hedged
it
round
about
and
digged
a
winepress
in
it
and
built
a
tower
and
let
it
out
to
husbandmen
and
went
into
a
far
country
and
when
the
time
of
the
fruit
drew
near
he
sent
his
servants
to
the
husbandmen
that
they
might
receive
the
fruits
of
it
and
the
husbandmen
took
his
servants
and
beat
one
and
killed
another
and
stoned
another
again
he
sent
other
servants
more
than
the
first
and
they
did
unto
them
likewise
but
last
of
all
he
sent
unto
them
his
son
saying
they
will
reverence
my
son
but
when
the
husbandmen
saw
the
son
they
said
among
themselves
this
is
the
heir
come
let
us
kill
him
and
let
us
seize
on
his
inheritance
and
they
caught
him
and
cast
him
out
of
the
vineyard
and
slew
him
when
the
lord
therefore
of
the
vineyard
cometh
what
will
he
do
unto
those
husbandmen
they
say
unto
him
he
will
miserably
destroy
those
wicked
men
and
will
let
out
his
vineyard
unto
other
husbandmen
which
shall
render
him
the
fruits
in
their
seasons
jesus
saith
unto
them
did
ye
never
read
in
the
scriptures
the
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
the
same
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner
this
is
the
lords
doing
and
it
is
marvellous
in
our
eyes
therefore
say
i
unto
you
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
be
taken
from
you
and
given
to
a
nation
bringing
forth
the
fruits
thereof
and
whosoever
shall
fall
on
this
stone
shall
be
broken
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
fall
it
will
grind
him
to
powder
and
when
the
chief
priests
and
pharisees
had
heard
his
parables
they
perceived
that
he
spake
of
them
but
when
they
sought
to
lay
hands
on
him
they
feared
the
multitude
because
they
took
him
for
a
prophet
